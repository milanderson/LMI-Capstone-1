{"0002": "under the current standards for medicare shared savings program (mssp) upside-only models, organizations are not forced to make a commitment to a new business model centered on value and outcomes, rather than on volume and market power. the length of time allowed in a one-sided risk model has historically proven to show no benefits to reduction of costs. this new process outlined in the \"pathways to success\" has great potential to change the landscape of accountable care organizations (aco) and cost reduction. however, by constantly lowering the benchmark for those that meet them can inevitably create a benchmark that is quite virtually unattainable. the health of individuals, especially older individuals that utilize healthcare resources is dynamic; in that it is constantly changing. these individuals may require more resources at certain times, virtually diminishing the cost savings an organization can see. perhaps a change in thinking with regards to the percentage of change for benchmarks based on savings should be reconsidered. this could make the two-sided risk models more enticing and feasible to organizations. a greater technical and policy alignment of the aco program with medicare advantage could encourage enrollment and benefit providers and patients alike, by adding predictability and reducing complexity. according to mostashari and broome (2018) the processes for establishing these rates are well understood, and the rates themselves are much more predictable. the rates are set prospectively, and do not require extensive analysis of cost trends months after the conclusion of the performance years.\r\n\r\nreference\r\nmostashari, f. & broome, t.

to the point. i, as a provider and administrator of a health system, have had a chance to review the proposed rule and feel it it my duty to respond with constructive comments.\r\n\r\ni feel the cms philosophy on accountable care organization and pathway to risk is fundamentally flawed. the uncertainty of targets, statistical chances or variation and volume based rewards continue in this pathway. i would like to strongly urge you all to consider overhauling the entire program. your proposal does nothing but extends the program for another five years. meanwhile you will continue to pay out large sums of monies based on random variations, wrongful rewards, and statistical \"winners.\"\r\n\r\nhere are the suggestions i have from a provider and management perspective who has dealt with moving a financially troubled organization towards value based care:\r\n\r\n1. your benchmark target setting strategy is unnecessarily complex, allows for propagation of \"bad\" utilization behavior, and rewards for minor adjustments. if you are truly looking to bend the cost curve, then regressing to mean national benchmark is absolutely important. elimination of regional variation is critical. rewarding the 50% of aco's that fall below the national pbpy spend is sending the message that cost of care is critical to success in aco. higher cost aco's do not contribute to reduced cost, and should face a penalty. so, set a national base benchmark that would be risk adjusted based on regional variations of risk score and only risk score. this creates absolute transparency in the benchmarks and goals.\r\n\r\n2. pay back penalties are ridiculous and will cause a many aco's to drop out of the program. it is interesting that you have not set up a pay back system for the physicians and providers. under mips the providers face a penalty, but for aco structure you have imposed a pay back strategy. i would recommend you consider a pathway for penalty. instead of pay back, aco's whose spend is greater than the set target will achieve a negative adjustment proportional to the percentage overspent from the benchmark for both part a and part b payments. to ease the burden, you could lift and divide the effect by half to make it equal to shared savings. you will likely get more aco's taking risk on this pathway than the current proposed payback methodology.\r\n\r\n3. the proposed rules continue to make misalignment between physician payments and aco's financial responsibilities. on one hand, you expect the aco's to bring physicians together and improve cost and quality of care. on the other hand, you set up different financial consequences for aco's and providers. the aco takes financial risk, but the providers are all rewarded with 5% bonus. this is the same effect of enforcing drg based payment to the hospitals, but physician reimbursement continues at ffs. you will get no traction in improving health care delivery by creating such antagonism, which i am sure you have learned from the hospital payment system program. i would recommend you consider the opportunity to reward physicians only if their aco is able to beat the benchmark. the aapm adjustment would only apply if the aco generated shared savings or demonstrated financial responsibility.\r\n\r\n4. the retrospective quality payment is ineffective as a strategy. it will never lead to quality improvement since the timelines do not match with realistic and practical patient outcomes. since medicine changes so rapidly, cms needs to embrace advancement in quality outcomes more than process based measures. the undue burden of reporting and administrative tasks is only creating provider burnout, not improving quality. to be effective, i would recommend stream lining quality efforts to 10 specific outcome measures that lead to social and public health impact. having direct financial incentive for each one and not tied with other financial outcomes allows organizations and physicians to drive, fund, and sustain continued quality efforts. you can financially justify additional payments with the move towards national benchmark target.\r\n\r\n5. finally, the concept of risk should include advancement to complete risk, not just shared risk. i would recommend that if an aco with sufficient volume is able to demonstrate good quality and low cost for three consecutive years, then they should be advanced for a more comprehensive capitated partnership. allow them to take on complete risk with capitated payments and complete scope of services for the care of the patient. this will lift burden from cms. cms can continue to provide oversight, monitor claims activity and adjust capitation rates based on services provided and overall quality of care delivered.\r\n\r\nplease do not hesitate to reach out if i can help in elaborating any concepts.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n

the year? how would they meet their percentage thresholds to become qp especially when these thresholds may be proposed to change next year?\r\n\r\n2. for current track 1+ aco's who have taken on initial risk, cms will not have performance data available for them until september 2019. how can they make the decision to advance to enhanced track without knowing their performance final results? i feel the same issue and concern will be faced by all performance-experienced aco's currently as they will not have any feedback on their performance until after the start of the new model.\r\n\r\nfor

successcms-1701-p\r\n\r\nas president of the hackensack alliance aco, a track 1 mssp participant from the onset of the program, i would like to share my views on the direction cms is taking as well as the proposed new rules. it is my understanding that the goal of the mssp program was to bend the cost curve and introduce the concept of the triple aim (which became the quadruple aim). a secondary benefit was to develop provider understanding of value based care models. it was clear to many of us that the major components of cost were related to inpatient hospitalizations, and also subacute care programs. interestingly, the historic development of these cost centers stems from governmental regulation creating payment methods for the care. if you pay someone to provide a service, then the service will be provided. if you pay someone for a certain outcome, then effort will be made to ensure that outcome.\r\nthe mssp program made no effort to curb the payments to these two major cost centers, and focused on physician behavior to drive success. once again, success was not identified as outcome improvement, but only cost cutting and documentation of process (quality outcomes). the reason acos with strong hospital ties were not as successful as expected is because the hospitals had no reason to change their operating behaviors. in fact, many hospitals were willing to accept readmission penalties, because the payment was in excess of the penalty. therefore, the mssp program rules did not correspond to effectuate the stated goals of the program.\r\nat the same time, other programs were being offered which diluted the ability of acos to succeed. these include medicare advantage and cpc+. the opportunities to realize profit from ma programs encourages hospitals and networks to develop programs specifically for those patients. their leakage is controlled by benefit plan, and the benchmarks are predetermined. in addition, the benchmarks are uniformly higher than mssp. the cpc+ program provides dollars to practices in order to improve care management services. if these services were available in mssp, the results would have been much different. if a physician is participating in mssp and cpc+, then the dollars for care management are added to the cost of care in mssp. this encourages acos to exclude doctors in cpc+, probably their most advanced providers.\r\nthe new proposal will decrease the shared savings percentage during the non-risk years. this will lessen the interest in the program. most physician-only acos are fearful of assuming risk because of the inability to control the two largest cost centers, as well as no control over leakage. the hospital supported acos will recognize that the more hospitalizations that occur, the higher risk of losses, and therefore not support mssp.\r\nthe point is that it appears that the new proposal intends to allow mssp to die a slow death, and blame the acos for not participating. i urge cms to reevaluate the program by looking at the intended goals, and then building a program which supports attaining those goals. perhaps the goal should be medicare advantage and cpc+ only. perhaps the goal should be to change the medicare benefit plan. perhaps there should be more incentive for medicare recipients to join ma. if the goal is to maintain current medicare enrollment, then the rules must be changed to direct patients away from the two highest cost centers- not just by changing provider behavior, but by changing behavior of hospitals and subacute care centers. as long as these cost centers benefit by volume, the cost curve is safe from bending.\r\n\r\nmorey menacker     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     ", "0006":

will never be 100% accurate under any assignment algorithm. that said, without any hesitation, i can say with full confidence that the best way to assign beneficiaries is by listed pcp. providers must ask patients to declare who their pcp is and this must be a primary care physician, primary care pa or np, or an internal medicine physician. there should be no other type of practitioner that counts for aco assignment. for example, a cardiologist or a pa that works for an orthopedist can not by definition and should not count as a pcp. you can't simply change the definition of primary care for the sake of a program. it will destroy the medical home model of care leading to uncoordinated care, increase costs, and poor quality care. specialists and their midlevels simply do not have the skills to coordinate the functions of a true primary care practitioner. allowing beneficiaries to select a specialist or a specialist's midlevel as a pcp through voluntary alignment is bad policy.\r\n\r\n2. there needs to be a path for pcmh level 3 federally qualified health centers to become an advanced payment model without having to join an aco. fqhcs already understand how to reduce costs and deliver high value quality care because of their experience with the uniform data system (uds) quality measures and processes. by additionally having to join an aco to participate in the mssp, it puts fqhcs at an unfair advantage because of the additional time, effort and resources required to track and participate in two high value quality programs while other types of clinics only have to participate in one high value quality program. this results in increased cost to fqhcs and added strain on staff. i recommend that their be a certification process for pcmh level 3 fqhcs that allows them to qualify as an apm. if they achieve certification, then they should be able to simply report the medicare quality data that is already contained within their uds reports. this would alleviate all of the extra requirements that come with joining an aco, which causes fqhc staff to be stretched too thin and results in a high level of stress. when joining our aledade aco, it was clear that we already knew how to to deliver high value quality care, while the other non-fqhc members were having to learn how to deliver this kind of care for the first time. i think it makes sense to require other clinic types that don't have the experience that fqhcs have join acos. however, it doesn't make much sense to require an fqhc to join an aco to access the mssp when they already know how to deliver high value quality care. thank you.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     ", "0008": "comments on 42 cfr parts 414 and 425\r\n\r\n[cms-1701-p]\r\n\r\nrin 0938-at45\r\nmedicare program;

cms-1701-p 42 cfr parts 414 and 425\n it is clear that cms, omb, and the other constituencies within the administration have worked tirelessly to improve the medicare shared saving program and to protect the medicare trust fund while balancing the needs and wants of both the taxpayer and beneficiary.  we applaud your efforts.\n before we make any specific recommendation, we would like to point out an area of general concern.  in the push to greater risk, a number of acos will undoubtedly drop from the program which may result in beneficiaries treated by those providers to lose the underlying quality improvement programs and initiatives.  further, as the shared savings program narrows it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus and assignment rules we are concerned that some of the most fragile and poorly coordinated populations are losing quality improvement programs.  this is specifically concerning for beneficiaries in skilled nursing facilities.  with cms excluding snf patients from assignment, this population that could so significantly benefit from coordination are left out of the movement toward value vs. volume.\n the expansion of the three year contract cycle to five years is of great concern.  the 2012/2013 starts have been either sheltered from consequences or put at a significant competitive disadvantage.  as noted in the nprm, several acos received windfall profits, our review of the 2012/2013 starts (all of them) suggests that some of the most efficient provider groups partnered with cms as early adopters, only to be put at a competitive disadvantage when the regional benchmarking formulas where deployed to later entrants.  further, it is not likely that the regulatory landscape will remain consistent over the next five years.  history demonstrated that the program is still maturing and significant advancement in regulation continue to be likely. shelter from consequence or competitively disadvantaging superior performers is not in the best interest of cms, beneficiaries or the tax payers.  we suggest that cms either shorten the contract cycles or provider for immediate  update for regulations (all ma provider contracts allow for such) on the annual anniversary of the contract effective date.\n our specific suggestions focus on making quality performance the mission critical determinant of success, followed closely behind by economic efficiency.  in general, those acos that demonstrate both high quality and lower costs than their regional rivals should be allowed to bring their better product result to the market in a more forceful and deliberate fashion.  we have modeled out the full cost, variable cost and net economic impacts of both the current and proposed regulations and find they net-net to be muted significantly in facility based acos because of the variable vs full cost elements of excess utilization.  gain and loss sharing rates alone will be insufficient to drive transformation of the health system to assure liquidity of the medicare trust fund.  allowing the market forces of a better product to guide beneficiaries in their care decisions will have greater impact on the net-net economics of the large systems and maximize the liquidity of the medicare trust fund.\n there are several areas which would benefit from greater effort, clarity and precision than that described in the nprm:  these are:\n\n1. substantively increase beneficiary alignment with high quality low cost acos  \n\n2. unify quality measures between medicare shared savings programs (the shared savings \n program) and medicare advantage (ma).\n3. use tools and techniques successful in ma to further enable the shared savings program. \n\n4. expansion of aipbp type programs to the shared savings program. \n\n5. vehicle for medical necessity determination and claim appeal for the shared savings \n program.\n encourage beneficiaries to align with high quality and low cost acos: cms should link the constraints of risk adjusted regional benchmarking to the quality score which will reinforce the imperative of high quality and lower cost care.   further, we suggest that a significant portion of this value be provided directly to the beneficiary.  our analysis indicates that for the highest performing acos (table below) an amount equal to 30% of regional benchmark adjustment value (after applying the regional/historic weighting factor) would provide the beneficiary a noticeable and tangible benefit that would result in greater alignment with the very best acos.  this incentive could be in the form of either reduced copays/coinsurance or a rebate on part b premiums will directly reinforce the goal of moving our health care system to high quality and low cost.\n in the table below is the example of expanding reginal to historic benchmark value that should be shared with beneficiaries for the highest quality and lower cost acos.  by including the beneficiary in the value generated by very high quality acos which demonstrate lower costs, significant market forces are brought to bear for the benefit of the trust fund and the beneficiary.  cms could utilize several options to administrate this element.  most easily administered is the reduced cost shares as they could be applied at the time of service when the beneficiary utilizes a provider in the aco.  either by the aco provider which is allowed to waive certain cost shares, or in the adjudication and pricing of a claim.  similar to the aipbp process providers would contract with these acos as either preferred providers/suppliers or actual aco participants.    the aco would choose to the waiving of cost share or having the increased amount paid (in the calculation of cost share in a claims process) from the shared savings payment.  we believe most acos would utilize the waived cost share by the provider option vs. increasing the amount paid by cms.  this would further encourage the beneficiaries to use aco contracted providers.\n slightly more problematic in administration, is the rebate of some portion of the part b premium. significantly enabled by prospective voluntary alignment, it would be reasonable for cms to require voluntary prospective alignment in order for the beneficiary to access the part b premium rebate.\n underlying quality score vs. report only value) of a new the shared savings program contract or upon renewal of existing aco entity.  these values would be updated annually to reinforce continued process improvement.\n in the table below, the trust fund retains no less than 60% of the value of low cost providers, and the beneficiaries may gain 12% (highest weighting x 30%).  the efficient health care system would then have a gross savings opportunity of 28%  of the differential prior to the application of the sharing percent with cms.  to further incent acos to take risk, this factor would only be available to level e or enhanced acos.  fully realized the trust fund retains 60% initially, then either an additional 7% (enhanced) or 14% (level e) of the regional vs. historic variation. this formula limits any windfall profits, provide more incentive for successful acos to move to risk and beneficiary to align with the high quality, lowest cost provider systems, as well as, blunt the incentive of the lowest cost acos to move to medicare advantage.  lastly, the market force implied within this structure should cause all providers in the geography to improve quality and lower costs.\n suggested quality score, constraint, and weighting quality score limit

likely that an aco with quality scores below 86% that was significantly above regional average would stay in the shared savings program.  further, the providers within the poor performing aco would see their relative cost to beneficiaries increase significantly, they are after all in a less valuable system of care.\n\n\n\n\n unifying quality measures between shared savings program and ma: there should be fewer measures which are published on a roadmap for implementation for both programs.  through the use of market forces in both programs, success on each measure would be all but assured.  the differing standards of compliance and different measures serves only to confuse the physicians and their staff, as well as, spread scant resources yet thinner across a broader water front of activities.  with a roadmap of measures and performance, organizations would focus their energies in achieving these metrics is systematic and deliberate fashion.  as measures are added, older measures should be phased out with larger thresholds, yet more significant penalties for a lack of performances.\n for example, if the super majority of contractors have achieved a 95%+ score the upside value of the measure would be retired while the downside would be retained for some period to entrench the process as a standard.  the penalty for sub 90% score could be a decrement of 5% of either net payment level in ma or benchmark in the shared savings program.  poor performers would suffer a significant consequence, while superior performers monitor maintenance and move incremental resources to emerging measures.  this decrement would be in addition to any regional benchmarking decrement outlined above.\n\n tools from medicare advantage (ma) to enable shared savings program. the shared savings program has created a pandora\u00e2\u0080\u0099s box issue related to the physician community.  historically, very few physicians had direct empirical evidence of their relative or absolute cost and quality.  now, most physicians in an aco know their panel cost, their quality score and the averages of the aco now know their absolute and relative economic performance. the high performing physicians are now decidedly motivated to balance their efforts in favor of\nma.  unfortunately, this would not really expand savings to the trust fund and would serve \n only to reduce options and choices for the beneficiaries.  the better solution for all constituencies is that mssp more closely resemble ma, more organization seeking higher savings.\n the improvement in the shared savings program rule comes in at least two areas.  first it he application of risk adjustment to benchmarking.  we have seen the implementation of icd10 increase the specificity diagnostic precision and hence risk score \u00e2\u0080\u0093 coding intensity and both ma and shared savings programs have made initial adjustments.  we should note that using coding intensity for the sole purposes of revenue enhancement borders on abuse as it relates to fwa regulations.  in the era of accountability, accurately and completely describing the diagnostic and health status of the population is well within an expected set of core competencies.  further, clinical information improvements from the greater specificity (goal of icd10, 11 and snomed) will yield important insights over the intermediate and longer term.  these are extremely important policy issues that will benefit from increased support.\n allowing risk adjustment to move more freely, while still normalizing back to a national 1.0 score provides delivery systems with substantive incentive to increase specificity, while protecting the trust fund from \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaming\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  applied in a zero-sum fashion, those acos that continue to document and code in a substandard fashion would bear the consequence of inferior administrative skills and ability.  inferior documentation and coding efforts degrade the ability of the improved information set to provide insights to the entire system. there is a real system consequence for this substandard information set, it is only appropriate that a consequence flow to substandard information providers. this should be applied to both ma and the shared savings program consistently.\n second is the sharing rates of savings within the programs.  in a fashion similar to the ma stars program, superior performances should be rewarded more directly economically and with some portion rewarding beneficiaries using the high quality/lowest cost delivery system. for example:\n quality score level a  level b  level c  level d  level e  enhanced 95-100 35% 35% 45% 55% 70% 80% 92-94.9 30% 30% 40% 50% 50% 75%\n89.0-91.9 25% 25% 30% 40% 45% 65% \n 86-88.9 20% 20% 25% 35% 40% 60% lt 85.9% 0 0 0 0 0 0\n combined with the regional benchmark suggestions above, the high quality low cost system would have an advantage that would drive a favorable competitive response from the other delivery systems in the area.  as the other delivery systems converge, cms is harvesting savings as the economics become level at a lower cost and sharing rate, data specificity is driven to a very high level, and beneficiaries now have more choices in high quality and low cost healthcare.\n\n expansion of aipbp to the shared savings program: acos face enormous working capital burdens.  aipbp may provide some relief from these burdens in the form of an interim cash flow.  to be certain, this program should only be extended to mspp contractors at level d or higher risk and would be 100% additive to the downside risk exposure otherwise calculated in the program.  further, expected payments would have to expand the financial guarantee otherwise provided, to assure the trust fund is not at risk for the payments provided which are beyond the financial guarantee provided by the aco we recommend 50% of the expected amount be added to the financial guarantee.  to protect the trust fund yet further, if the experience through june 30 of the performance year indicated that there would be a deficit (prospectively assigned acos) the payments would be suspended and held by cms.  lastly, if the aco where to have expenses above the calculated benchmark, 100% of the aipbp funding would be recaptured by cms before any sharing percentage would be applied.\n there are several benefits beyond simply cash flow that would accrue to the beneficiaries, trust fund, and cms.  these are \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 providers contracted in the aipbp would be more deeply integrated for customer service, care coordination, medical appropriateness, and timely information sharing. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 acos would be incentivized to provide educate for all aco providers on who are the aipbp providers, install processes and programs to improve access, monitoring compliance, expanding information sharing with aipbp providers for quality improvement and consistent health care outcomes. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 acos would take much greater interest in the performance of all providers treating their assigned beneficiaries. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 post-acute providers and treatment pathways would be investigated deeply.\n vehicle for medical necessity determinations and claims appeal: there needs to be a vehicle to engage the health care providers beyond submitting a set of documents to the oig for a fraud investigation.  not all events raise to the level of intentional fraud.  some events are simply clumsy data input, others may be less than energetic pursuit of lower cost alternatives or seeking prior treatment records.  further, most ma contractors provide this vehicle to their downstream risk/gain sharing provider groups.  this is not

the trust fund and the aco.  very quickly, service providers would seek to engage acos to comply with quality programs, care navigation standards, updated treatment pathways, and care coordination

administrator verma:\n we appreciate the centers for medicare and medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) efforts to improve the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and agree with the fundamental goal of the proposed rule\u00e2\u0080\u0094to strengthen incentives for accountable care organizations (acos) to reduce wasteful health care spending.  as academic researchers, we have published numerous studies assessing the effects of medicare aco programs on spending and quality and have written extensively about the weak incentives in the mssp and the options for reform.1  we believe that health policy should be evidence-based to the extent possible and should anticipate the dynamic consequences of changes in incentives.  although we agree that stronger incentives for acos to reduce medicare spending could accelerate the early success of the mssp, we are concerned that several key provisions in the proposed rule are at odds with existing evidence and could lead, conversely, to higher medicare spending when implemented in the context of a voluntary program.\n 1 mcwilliams, j. m., b. e. landon, et al.

fully accounting for patient factors.  implementing such a model too quickly, however, will likely have harmful effects on participation that act to increase rather than decrease medicare spending. in short, the proposed convergence of aco benchmarks within markets could cause the voluntary mssp to unravel, particularly when additional risk-bearing is imposed. thus, we believe that the primary goal of the mssp at this stage should be to reduce excessive spending so as to cause convergence in spending between providers and allow future consideration of a longer-term model in which payments might be set regionally as in medicare advantage.  as long as the mssp is voluntary and there is wide variation in spending, this goal can only be attained by strongly encouraging the participation of providers serving patients who receive less efficient care and establishing strong incentives for those providers to reduce wasteful spending.  below, we summarize and then detail our key concerns, their empirical and conceptual bases, and our recommended changes to the rule. we sincerely hope our analyses and comments are helpful in your deliberations and would be happy to discuss them further.\n summary our chief concern is that the combination of requiring risk for spending in excess of benchmarks (downside risk) and earlier blending of historical benchmarks with average regional spending via the regional adjustments will introduce even stronger incentives for acos with high spending for their patients to exit the mssp and for providers with already low spending to remain in or join the mssp. such systematic selection has already occurred and will grow worse as regionalization of benchmarks and downside risk are imposed. there is strong evidence of strategic participation decisions by acos already (summarized below).  if the mssp is to cause convergence in spending by encouraging acos with high spending to reduce wasteful care, it needs to retain and attract providers with high spending and give them strong incentives to lower it.  although downside risk and regionalized benchmarks strengthen incentives to save, only providers who participate will be exposed to the stronger incentives.  as acos with high spending exit and those with low spending enter and continue in the mssp, acos will appear to be performing better against their benchmarks (ostensibly greater savings per program metrics) but the true impact of the program will be a substantial increase in medicare spending in the form of subsidies to already more efficient acos. to the extent that risk-adjustment is incomplete, regionalizing benchmarks will also cause unmerited financial transfers from providers serving healthy and socially advantaged patients to those serving sicker and disadvantaged patients.\n 3\n particularly among physician groups and acos with high initial spending.2,3,4,5  while incentives have been very weak and should be strengthened, we believe that it is important to refine the mssp in ways that build on those early gains rather than risk reversion and a squandering of providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 demonstrated willingness to try to reign in excessive spending.\n therefore, while we agree with the goal of strengthening incentives to save, we recommend a direction that differs from the proposed rule in key respects.  specifically, to encourage participation and foster convergence in spending while the mssp remains a voluntary program, we recommend eliminating regional benchmark adjustments, eliminating the rebasing of benchmarks that has greatly diminished aco incentives to ever save, and increasing the shared savings rate according to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending relative to their regional average.  given the evidence that physician group acos have generated greater savings than larger hospital-integrated organizations, we agree with the spirit of proposed provisions that favor participation by low-revenue groups but would go even further to do so.  specifically, we recommend that requirements to assume downside risk be applied only to acos with high revenues on par with those generated by health systems providing inpatient, outpatient, and specialty care (i.e., accounting for a high proportion of medicare spending for their patients).  lower-revenue acos should still be able to elect downside risk in exchange for favorable regulatory treatment and higher shared-savings rates.  program results and design should be revisited regularly, with monitoring of within- market spending variation to guide consideration of a longer-term payment model at a future time.  such an approach would establish strong incentives for all acos to lower wasteful spending, regardless of initial efficiency, by allowing acos time to recoup up-front investments and by eliminating penalties (in the form of lower benchmarks) for achieving savings.  such an approach also would afford the time necessary to modernize risk- adjustment methods to address \u00e2\u0080\u009cupdcoding\u00e2\u0080\u009d and unintended consequences for disparities.\n in addition to these core recommendations, we also offer suggestions for improving the methods for risk adjustment, trending benchmark updates, addressing compositional changes in aco provider participants, and determining aco organizational revenue.\n in summary, we believe a conclusion that the mssp has been a failure after 6 years of operation is inappropriate. the incentives for participating acos to lower spending have always been weak\u00e2\u0080\u0094the program can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have failed if there was never much opportunity for success. moreover, the mssp has generated meaningful savings from physician groups, for whom the incentives have been stronger.  ideally at the outset, the program would have had sufficiently strong incentives to allow more definitive judgment of its success.  delivery system reform is a slow process, and the voluntary nature of the mssp limits the options for strengthening incentives, but incentives to save in a voluntary program can be strong without discouraging participation.  for these reasons, we believe that the proposed changes to aco benchmarking and risk-sharing are premature and counterproductive and that other available strategies should be pursued to accelerate progress.\n 4\n key points \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the mssp has generated net savings to medicare \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 benchmarks are not valid counterfactuals \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 regional blending of

for assessing program \n savings, base assessments of program impact solely on studies that are well designed to estimate it.  benchmarks need not be redesigned to be valid counterfactuals\u00e2\u0080\u0094their purpose is to set incentives\u00e2\u0080\u0094but they should not be used for program evaluation.\n2. set the shared-savings rate at a minimum of 50% for all acos in all performance years \n and tracks.\n3. eliminate rebasing of benchmarks that links an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new benchmark to its spending \n changes in the prior period.  this link should be severed completely.  instead, an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original baseline should be updated annually according to a growth rate that is unrelated to its prior performance, adjusting for changes in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participating providers.\n4. eliminate regional adjustments that blend aco historical benchmarks with regional \n spending.  replace with shared savings rates that rise continuously with lower aco spending relative to its region, starting at 50% for acos with the highest spending for their region and rising to 80% for acos with the lowest spending for their region.\n5. eliminate downside risk requirements for lower-revenue acos by retaining track 1, \n eliminating the basic track, and allowing voluntary participation in track 1+.  replace the \u00e2\u0080\u009cclinician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d basis for determining loss limits in track 1+ with the proposed revenue-based determination (revenue/total spending for aco population).\n6. continue to require high-revenue acos to assume downside risk commensurate with \n the enhanced track but set the threshold for defining high revenue at a higher level corresponding to an integrated health system. also require downside risk of very large physician groups with market power. rather than rely solely on participant lists, use additional data on full organizational structure to determine organization-wide revenue for core practices responsible for attribution.\n7. eliminate cap on downward benchmark adjustments that result from decreases in risk \n 5\n average in the future (not in the near term per recommendation 4), implement additional payments or benchmark adjustments so that acos are not penalized for serving higher-risk patients.\n8. remove an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed population from benchmark update determinations to \n preserve incentives for acos to lower spending. use multilevel statistical modeling approaches to estimate aco-specific update factors that reflect regional and national trends, with greater weight placed on national trends for aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that serve higher proportions of patients in their service area.  after a phase of program expansion, switch to using a desirable preset rate of benchmark growth applied to all acos.\n the mssp has generated net savings to medicare the use of benchmarks to assess the impact of the mssp on medicare spending has caused much confusion about whether the mssp has produced savings to medicare net of bonuses and the extent of those savings.  program benchmarks are important because they establish the incentives for acos to participate and lower spending.  but understanding aco responses to those incentives requires rigorous evaluation in which spending for aco- attributed patients is compared with spending that would be expected to have occurred in the absence of aco participation in the mssp (the counterfactual).  benchmarks are not valid counterfactuals for a variety of reasons, several of which have caused benchmark- based assessments to underestimate savings in the mssp (at least through 2016).  first, until 2017, benchmarks were updated with the use of national spending growth rates (in absolute dollars/year).  because medicare spending growth varies geographically, this feature of benchmark setting meant that an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark differed systematically from its counterfactual (expected) spending in almost all cases.  the direction of the bias has differed for acos in areas of faster vs. slower spending growth, and the average effect has been to significantly underestimate expected spending because the national growth rate (updated factor) was determined among all ffs medicare beneficiaries, including those with no primary care services to support attribution.  beneficiaries with no qualifying services, on average, have much lower spending and thus lower spending growth rates in absolute terms.  for example, we estimate that medicare spending growth from 2013 to 2016 was $140/beneficiary slower among all beneficiaries than among those with at least one office visit with a primary care physician. based on this difference, the national growth rate used to set benchmarks underestimated spending reductions achieved by acos for their primary care patients from 2013-2016 by approximately 1.3 percentage points.\n second, any spending reductions achieved by acos contribute to a slowing in national spending growth, causing benchmarks to fall.  for example, based on our most recent analysis of mssp savings,6 spending reductions achieved by the 2012-2014 entry cohorts of acos caused their benchmarks in 2015 to be approximately 0.3 percentage points lower than if they did not lower spending.  third, rebasing of aco benchmarks at the outset of second agreement periods that lowers benchmarks according to the extent of spending reductions achieved in the first period causes benchmarks in the second period to diverge even further below counterfactual spending, causing further underestimation of savings. this occurred for the 2012-2013 entry cohorts when they began their second agreement\n 6\n periods in 2016.  other features of benchmark setting have had less predictable effects but also could have contributed to underestimation of savings. for example, the approach to risk adjustment has appropriately tried to address other program goals, such as mitigating incentives to increase diagnosis coding intensity, but in the process may have not accurately reflected changes in the health risk of patients served by acos.\n for these reasons, analyses using aco benchmarks to quantify mssp savings are uninformative and should be ignored when assessing program savings.  benchmarks are of obvious importance in establishing incentives and determining performance bonuses but are not valid counterfactuals and yield highly misleading results when used to assess program impact.  for example, whereas benchmark comparisons would suggest that the mssp caused cumulative net losses to medicare of $266m in 2014 and 2015 (including shared-savings bonuses), our evaluations, which use local concurrent spending changes to establish counterfactual spending, more accurately quantify the impact of the program as generating $431m in cumulative savings to medicare over those two years after accounting for bonuses \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a $697m difference from benchmark-based savings estimates.  these greater savings are also consistent with market-level analyses conducted by government analysts and other researchers (including those summarized in the regulatory impact analysis of the proposed rule).  the review of the evidence in the regulatory impact analysis is at odds with characterizations of one-sided contracts in the mssp (e.g., on\np.41787) as an unaffordable option that increases medicare spending. \n\n although the direct savings we estimated are modest, the total savings to medicare are greater because of spillover effects.7  changes in care for patients attributed to acos are likely to affect medicare beneficiaries served by acos but not attributed to one.8  moreover, reductions in ffs medicare spending achieved by acos in turn lower payment rates to medicare advantage plans.  particularly because of the large size of the growing medicare advantage program, these spillovers are substantial, approximately doubling the net savings to medicare from the mssp based on our previously published calculations.9\n moreover, the savings have varied with the strength of incentives to which acos are exposed, suggesting that refinements that strengthen incentives without compromising participation would lead to greater savings.  in particular, we have consistently found that savings are significantly greater among physician-group acos than hospital-integrated acos.10,11,12,13  because physician groups provide less of the care spectrum, they have much\n 7 mcwilliams, j. (2016). \"savings from acos\u00e2\u0080\u0094building on early success.\" annals of internal medicine 165(12): 873-\n875. \n 7\n stronger incentives to reduce spending.  all else equal, acos have stronger incentives to lower spending on care they do not provide than care they do provide.  when acos lower spending on care they provide, any resulting shared-savings bonuses are offset to some extent by foregone fee-for-service profits.  similarly, spillover effects on non-aco patients (including commercially insured patients) have greater financial consequences for larger hospital-based acos.  if a primary care-focused aco implements systemic care redesigns to reduce excessive inpatient or specialty care for all of its patients (not just those covered by its mssp contract), it does not incur losses in revenue for non-aco patients.  thus, physician groups have much stronger incentives as acos to lower spending and to implement more systemic changes that affect care for all patients. not only have savings been convincingly higher for physician group acos but they have also been growing over time consistently in each mssp entry cohort.12  in our analyses, we have also confirmed that the greater savings estimated for physician groups are not due to those acos being located in higher-spending or higher-use regions or having higher spending for their regions (we obtain similar results when adjusting for those factors).  because physician groups effectively have a higher shared-savings rate (because they incur lower offsetting costs when lowering spending), these findings foreshadow the additional savings that may be realized if shared savings rates are increased.\n savings have varied with strength of incentives in other ways, too.  for example, savings have been particularly pronounced in post-acute care, a leading source of waste in medicare which most acos do not provide and thus almost universally have strong incentives to limit.  in addition, assuming the costs of reducing spending are lower when spending is higher (where there is more waste it is easier to cut), savings should be greater for acos with higher baseline spending for their region or in higher-spending regions. indeed, that has been observed as well.10\n recommendation 1: because benchmark-based calculations are not informative for assessing program savings, we urge cms to base assessments of program impact solely on studies that are well designed to estimate it. benchmarks need not be redesigned to be valid counterfactuals\u00e2\u0080\u0094their purpose is to set incentives\u00e2\u0080\u0094but they should not be used for program evaluation.\n current incentives weak for reasons other than lack of downside risk there is near-universal agreement that incentives have been weak in the mssp, but the discourse has focused almost exclusively on the lack of downside risk in mssp contracts as the cause of weak incentives.  the proposed rule intends to correct this perceived flaw by requiring currently participating high-revenue acos to assume significant downside risk immediately by entering the enhanced track, requiring new high-revenue participants to enter the enhanced track after 5 years, and requiring all new entrants and continuing low-revenue acos to assume some downside risk after 2 years of participation in the basic track.  however, there are other major reasons why incentives to lower spending have been weak in the mssp and thus other options for strengthening them.\n 8\n imperfect quality scores reduce the shared savings rate, it has been even lower, averaging\n44.2% in 2014 and 47.8% in 2017.  such shared-savings rates offer limited opportunities to \n profit relative to the status quo because acos incur substantial costs from being an aco and attempting to earn shared savings.14 these include the costs of aco governance and quality reporting, efforts to lower spending and improve performance on quality measures, and (if those efforts are successful) any offsetting losses in profits as described above. accordingly, the proposed reduction in the shared savings rate to 25-35% for acos in all levels of the basic track except level e is likely to eliminate opportunities for acos to save on net, reduce aco investments, and therefore reduce the savings to medicare generated by acos and attract fewer acos into the program.\n second, the rebasing of the historical component of aco benchmarks every 3 years to reflect an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most recent 3 years of spending greatly diminishes acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 incentives to ever save because spending reductions now are penalized with lower benchmarks later.15 to the extent that the costs of lowering spending are fixed (e.g., upfront investments with permanent effects on spending), rebasing reduces the time acos have to recoup those costs.  to the extent that the costs of lowering spending are variable (must be incurred each time spending is reduced), expending effort to reduce wasteful services in a given year might contribute to shared savings for that performance year (if the minimum savings rate is exceeded) but will definitely cause the benchmark in the next agreement period to be lower and below the expected spending level under a status quo in which the effort is not expended again.  thus, in a contract with symmetric upside and downside risk, variable cost interventions (even if effective) pose a present-day net cost to acos.15\n for example, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say it costs a physician group aco $1000 in care manager salary to prevent one $10,000 hospital admission through patient monitoring and timely engagement, diverting patients away from emergency departments and to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary care practices when possible.  for simplicity, assume 1-year agreement periods. the aco will receive $5,000 in shared savings for a net $4,000 savings from such effort in the first agreement period, but its benchmark in the subsequent period will be lowered by $10,000, posing a $5,000 future loss (assuming 50% shared losses) and thus a net $1000 present day cost from the care manager\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort if the aco plans to stay in the program for a second period.  the aco can expend the $1000 in care management again in the second period to avoid the penalty (it no longer produces a bonus from doing so because the benchmark is lowered), but as long as it participates in the program it must do so indefinitely, in every year of participation, to avoid the penalty (because spending will rise back to its previous level if the variable cost is not incurred).  thus, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incentives are either to never try to prevent admissions or to try to do so and then leave the program.16\n the key point is that acos have had little incentive to ever lower spending because of the link between the spending reductions they achieve and subsequent benchmarks. one could argue that it is astonishing that the mssp has produced any savings at all.  not surprisingly,\n 9\n dropout in the 2012 and 2013 entry cohorts of acos was most marked when their benchmarks were set to be rebased at the start of their second agreement periods in 2016. specifically, 44 of 191 acos (23%) left the program between 2015 and 2016 after annual exit rates averaging just 6.6% from 2013-2015 over the first agreement period.\n recommendation 2: set the shared-savings rate at a minimum of 50% for all acos in all performance years and tracks.\n recommendation 3: eliminate rebasing of benchmarks that links an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new benchmark to its spending changes in the prior period.  this link should be completely severed.  instead, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original baseline should be updated annually according to a growth rate that is unrelated to its prior performance, adjusting for changes in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participating providers.\n two concerns have been raised about the approach we are recommending, but we believe they have received too much weight in deliberations over mssp rules to date and are addressable.  first, without rebasing aco benchmarks down to their more recent levels of spending, some have commented that this will allow acos with initially high spending to eventually earn windfall profits.  we agree that some high-spending acos would be able to earn sizeable shared-savings bonuses eventually and believe that a principal goal of the mssp should be to avail such opportunities.  but shared savings are not equal to profits for the reasons we note above; they may be largely offset by the costs of lowering spending17 and program participation.  for many acos with initially high spending, particularly high- revenue acos that incur offsetting losses in ffs profits when restricting provision of care, the mssp may merely offer an opportunity to mitigate those losses as they lower spending to levels of efficiency offered by other providers in their area.  that may nevertheless be a goal of providers with high spending, particularly if they know with greater certainty the long-term direction of medicare payment policy.  but they will be unlikely to participate and pursue that goal if the costs are made too great by downside risk and regional blending.  as we discuss below, concerns about an uneven playing field between acos with higher vs. lower spending in the same market can be addressed by increasing the shared- savings rate for more efficient acos.  in addition, under both the current and proposed rules, benchmarks will be progressively reduced by the annual benchmark updates as the program matures and expands, because regional and national spending growth will progressively slow as acos increasingly lower medicare spending.  thus, the annual updates will still apply downward pressure on aco benchmarks, thereby limiting aco profits.  the key distinctions are that, with rebasing eliminated: 1) the downward pressure on benchmarks would be at a rate that appropriately lags behind the downward effect acos have on spending as opposed to at an equal rate (thereby encouraging participation); and 2) the downward pressure on a given aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark would not be caused by its own efforts to lower spending (thereby strengthening incentives to save).\n second, concerns have been raised about the ability to adequately adjust for changes in aco provider composition over longer periods of time.  an inability to do so could allow acos to select more efficient practices (taxpayer identification numbers [tins]) for\n 10\n inclusion to earn shared savings without lowering spending.  more generally, the clinicians and practices represented by a given tin may change substantially because of mergers and acquisitions, and tins may newly appear or cease to appear in claims.  these challenges can be addressed with relatively straightforward approaches, several of which we have implemented in our evaluations of the mssp.18,19  when an aco adds tins to their participant list, the baseline period for those tins could be established as the 3 years prior to the addition (i.e., different parts of the aco would have different baseline periods).  for tins that exhibit large changes from baseline to performance years in the number of clinicians billing under them or that newly appear in claims, npi-tin billing relationships can be used to identify additional tins in the original baseline period to assess baseline spending for a set of providers that is more consistent with an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participant list in a given performance year.  for tins where provider consistency between performance and baseline years is tenuous and cannot be corrected with such methods, rebasing could be allowed for the portion of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark accounted for by such tins.  moreover, to the extent that the mssp encourages acos to include more efficient providers in their contracts, that may help foster competition among providers to be efficient and attractive to acos.  thus, such behavior should not necessarily be viewed as wasteful gaming.\n problems with regional benchmark adjustments and evidence of cost- increasing participation decisions in the 2014 cohort the regional adjustment in the current benchmarking methodology, particularly when implemented in an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first agreement period as proposed, is highly problematic in a voluntary mssp, particularly if downside risk is imposed on participants.  it will surely lead to exit by acos with spending above their region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s average.  these acos with high baseline spending have produced greater savings than acos with lower spending18,20 and are critical to retain and attract if the mssp is to ever cause sufficient within-market convergence in spending to facilitate a transition to a longer-term payment system in which providers bear risk and population-based benchmarks are similar for different providers in the same market (accounting for patient factors).\n there is evidence already of acos with high spending for their region selectively exiting the program in response to the prospect of regional benchmark adjustments.  as noted in the proposed rule, the 25-35% blending of acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 historical benchmarks with regional average spending led to substantial swings in benchmarks in 2017 for acos that started in 2014.  this was to be expected from the documented wide variation acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk-adjusted spending relative to their service areas.21   as described in the table below, introduction of the regional adjustment in 2017 was associated with 21% dropout in the 2014 cohort and more than a quadrupling of the mean \u00e2\u0080\u009csavings rate\u00e2\u0080\u009d among remaining participants (from\n0.5% to 2.2%).  the \u00e2\u0080\u009csavings rate\u00e2\u0080\u009d indicates where an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending was relative to its \n benchmark, with positive values indicating that spending was below the benchmark.  to distinguish this quantity from estimates of actual aco savings estimated by rigorous evaluations, we refer to this quantity as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbenchmark savings rate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the increase in the\n 11\n benchmark savings rate in 2017 for the 2014 cohort (bolded in the table) was the most substantial increase observed in any entry cohort in any pair of years and thus unlikely due to improvement in aco performance alone.  the other year-to-year increases in benchmark savings rates were much more modest, including those associated with rebasing and extensive dropout in 2016 for the 2012-2013 cohorts.  of the remaining acos from the 2014 entry cohort, 81% had positive regional adjustments in 2017, meaning that their historical benchmarks were below average regional spending and thus that their participation was subsidized.  this pattern is highly suggestive of selective dropout of acos with spending above their regional average, causing the appearance of increased savings that would be more accurately characterized as subsidies to acos with lower spending.\n\n\n\n entry year 2015 performance 2016 performance 2017 performance n

claims data, we confirmed that acos in the 2014 cohort that exited the program in 2017 had substantially higher spending for their region than those who remained in the program.  specifically, we fit a model of total spending per beneficiary in 2014-15 as a function of county and year fixed effects and fixed effects for acos in the 2014 cohort. the latter set of fixed effects estimated the mean spending difference between each aco in the 2014 cohort and its service area.  this spending deviation was, on average, $787/beneficiary higher for acos dropping out than for those remaining in the mssp.\n 12\n we understand that the costs of lowering spending are likely greater for acos with lower spending (less \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-hanging fruit\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and that acos already providing more efficient care have voiced concerns that basing benchmarks solely on acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 historical spending creates unfairly greater opportunities for providers who have been historically less efficient. providers who are more efficient than others, however, are not necessarily efficient.  for example, in our empirical work on low-value care in medicare, we found that providers who provide the least low-value care still provide more low-value care than the difference between the most and least efficient providers.22,23  therefore, acos with low spending for their region should be able to reduce wasteful spending further, but likely require greater rewards to cover the higher costs of doing so.  therefore, to retain and attract acos with lower spending and to recognize their greater level of efficiency and the greater challenge they face in further reducing spending, we recommend replacing the regional adjustment with higher shared savings rates for acos with lower spending for their service area.  this could be implemented in a graded fashion, with shared savings rates rising continuously from a minimum of 50% for acos with the highest spending for their region to 80% for acos with the lowest spending for their region, using the most recent 2 years to assess acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 standing relative to their region.  relating the shared-savings rate to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 most recent level of spending will also strengthen incentives for acos to lower spending.\n it is important to recognize that higher shared savings rates do not mean lesser savings for medicare.  first, higher shared savings rates should attract more providers into the mssp. so even if medicare receives a lower proportion of the savings for a given aco, there should be more acos generating savings. second, higher shared savings rates should elicit stronger efforts by acos to lower spending.  to date, acos with spending below their regional average have not produced significant savings.  therefore, increasing the savings rate for an aco with low spending for their region can only increase savings to medicare from that aco, on average. third, because a higher shared savings rate does not apply to savings from spillover effects (e.g., lower medicare advantage payment rates), increasing the shared-savings rate will reduce the amount of savings to medicare from a given aco with a given performance level much less than the change in the percentage would indicate.\n finally, it is also important to bear in mind that most acos provide only some of the care spectrum (lower revenue acos).  these acos tend to be primary care or multispecialty physician groups.  thus, much of the inefficient care delivered to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population may not be provided by the aco.  accordingly, such inefficient care offers opportunities for efficient physician groups to enter those communities and reduce spending as acos.\n recommendation 4: eliminate regional adjustments that blend aco historical benchmarks with regional spending.  replace with shared savings rates that rise continuously with lower aco spending relative to its region, starting at 50% for acos with the highest spending for their region and rising to 80% for acos with the lowest spending for their region.\n\n 13\n downsides of downside risk not only can incentives in the mssp be strengthened without imposing downside risk for spending in excess of benchmarks, but downside risk may ultimately strengthen incentives very little and will likely cause more problems than it solves, acting to diminish instead of increase savings to medicare.\n as a preliminary point, it is important to recognize that track 1 is not riskless.  as described above, all acos incur significant administrative and reporting costs to participate in the mssp, and those that try to lower spending or improve quality incur additional costs.  these costs pose a potential downside even if the risk-sharing is one- sided.  acos lose money if they fail to earn sufficiently high shared-savings to offset the costs of participation and effort to achieve savings.  as evidence that track 1 is a downside risk track, the rate of dropout from the mssp has been substantial, and acos that have dropped out are disproportionately those that did not receive shared-savings bonuses. specifically by 2018, 40-45% of acos in the 2012-2013 entry cohort and 35% of the 2014 cohort had exited the mssp.  benchmark savings rates were substantially lower among acos dropping out than among those staying in the program.  in the 2012-2013 cohorts, for example, the mean benchmark savings rate among acos that have dropped out was\n0.37% before they dropped out, compared with 1.44% among those continuing in the \n program.  if track 1 were riskless, acos not receiving bonuses would stay in the program. given that dropout has been substantial and driven largely by the limited performance-based risk already present in track 1, we should expect that additional downside risk in the form of two-sided risk sharing will accelerate dropout and discourage participation.\n 14\n that provisions that would further discourage participation by acos that do not perform well against their benchmarks (downside risk and regional adjustment of benchmarks) would be detrimental to the program.\n since the enhanced track is essentially the pioneer model, the 50% dropout rate observed in the pioneer model should also serve as a cautionary tale about the extent of voluntary participation that should be expected in the enhanced track.  (only 16 of the 32 pioneer acos remained in two-sided models [pioneer or next generation] by 2016). limiting participation in the mssp by high-revenue organizations, however, may prove to be sound policy if a goal of the mssp is to foster competition by offering shared savings opportunities that appeal selectively to smaller organizations and physician groups.\n as another point of evidence that is important for considering downside risk requirements, recent assertions that the downside risk tracks (2, 3, and now 1+) have caused greater savings are misleading and we believe incorrect.  some analysts, including the medicare payment advisory commission,24 have observed that acos participating in tracks 2 and 3 have higher benchmark savings rates and have concluded that downside risk elicits greater savings.  however, only a small percentage of acos have participated in track 2 or 3 (8% in 2018), and most of them transitioned into these tracks after experience in track 1 (as of 2015, 99% of acos were in track 1).  thus, these acos were able to select into track 2 or 3 to take advantage of the higher shared-savings rates after ascertaining that their spending would continue to be below their benchmarks, whether because of preceding success in lowering spending or other factors that cause benchmarks to deviate from counterfactual spending.  indeed, of the 32 acos that transitioned from track 1 to track 2 or 3 by 2018, the mean benchmark savings rate was 3.6% over the 3 years prior to changing tracks, vs. just\n0.6% among other acos remaining in track 1.  for the subgroup of acos that entered track \n 2 or 3 in 2016 or 2017, the 1-2 years of downside risk exposure did not affect that pre- existing difference in benchmark savings rates, which remained similar in 2017 (3.5% for acos in tracks 2/3 vs. 1.3% for acos in track 1), suggesting that entry into a track with downside risk contributed no additional savings.  the mean benchmark savings rate in the 3 years prior to transitioning to track 1+ was similarly high (2.3%) among acos leaving track 1 for track 1+ in 2018.  the mean benchmark savings rate in 2017 among acos that entered track 2 or 3 directly, without a prior agreement period in track 1, was much lower\n(0.8%) than among acos selecting into downside risk tracks after experience in track 1.   \n\n in addition, we know from evaluations of the pioneer model25,26 that spending reductions in that 2-sided model were no greater than those achieved in 1-sided contracts in the mssp. similarly, the evidence shows that the two-sided next generation (next gen) model has performed no better than track 1 of the mssp when accounting for duration of participation in an aco program. specifically, the recent evaluation of year 1 of the next gen model by norc found gross annual savings of $210/beneficiary in 2016, but 15 of the\n 15\n 18 acos participating in next gen had significant prior experience in the pioneer model or mssp, including 2 of the 4 acos that drove the bulk of the savings.  these gross savings from next gen are no bigger than those achieved in the mssp when appropriately compared with mssp acos with multiple years of experience.  for example, in our recently published evaluation of the mssp, we found gross annual savings of $213/beneficiary in 2015 for acos entering in 2012 or 2013 (slightly greater than the next gen estimate).  thus, there is no evidence to date that downside risk has enhanced gross savings in medicare aco contracts, and thus no evidence that downside risk has elicited a stronger response from acos.\n without eliciting stronger efforts by acos to lower spending, downside risk does allow cms to recoup a portion of spending in excess of benchmarks.  for example, the 2016 net savings per beneficiary in next gen ($130/beneficiary in net savings to medicare) were greater than the 2015 net savings per beneficiary in the 2012-2013 entry cohorts of mssp acos ($62/beneficiary) despite the similar gross savings.  however, the net savings achieved by the 18 acos in next gen (most of which are large health systems) were smaller than the net savings generated by physician-group acos in the mssp ($180/beneficiary) and constituted much smaller aggregate net savings than produced by the more popular mssp ($62m from next gen\nvs. $190m from all 2012-2013 entrants in the mssp).  this underscores the importance of \n allowing physician groups (lower revenue organizations) to participate in one-sided contracts and suggests that downside risk could be used by cms to protect against losses from health systems, whose incentives in one-sided contracts are very weak. but we would note that any losses recouped by cms by requiring downside risk are likely to be at least partially, if not fully, offset by the increase in advanced apm bonus payments for providers accepting downside risk.  in addition, because the advanced apm bonus is structured as 5% of part b revenue, it acts to weaken incentives for acos to reduce provision of wasteful part b services (the size of the bonus is reduced when part b revenue is reduced).\n all else equal, we agree that introducing downside risk-sharing strengthens incentives for acos to lower spending.  but all else will not remain equal if downside risk is imposed, particularly because the mssp is voluntary and the proposed introduction of downside risk is coupled with regional blending of benchmarks.  since acos with spending above their regional average will disproportionately exit the program, most remaining acos will have spending below their regional average and thus benchmarks above their historical spending.  for those acos, downside risk adds little additional incentive to lower spending below the status quo because the incentive to lower spending when spending is below the benchmark stems from the upside risk sharing provisions. the cost of maintaining the status quo for those acos is the foregone profits from not earning more shared savings, not penalties from downside risk.  thus, because of the anticipated participation losses, imposing downside risk may not significantly strengthen incentives for remaining acos.\n 16\n losses, particularly when sustained repeatedly over multiple years.  because many acos will seek to mitigate their risk of losses, the extent to which downside risk incentives will reach the levels of organization currently exposed to one-sided incentives is unclear.  since health management firms take a cut of any shared savings, requiring downside risk will also weaken upside risk incentives for acos that partner with such firms.\n moreover, provider responses to mitigate downside risk will act to erode a key advantage of the aco model over the medicare advantage model \u00e2\u0080\u0093 lower administrative costs from direct contracting between medicare and providers.  as more acos pay premiums for reinsurance premiums and fees to management firms (which may take the form of a cut of shared savings), the administrative costs of the program will grow.\n finally, a stated motivation in the proposed rule for imposing downside risk is to discourage abuse of the program by provider organizations that participate to exploit waivers from stark and anti-kickback law and engage in anticompetitive behavior.  the proposed rule goes so far as to state, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfurther, the presence of an \u00e2\u0080\u0098upside-only\u00e2\u0080\u0099 track may be encouraging consolidation in the marketplace, reducing competition and choice for medicare ffs beneficiaries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  while this is certainly a valid concern, we are aware of no empirical evidence supporting this statement.  in fact, research to date has found little evidence of greater consolidation among aco participants as a result of the mssp.27 consolidation had been occurring before the mssp and has generally continued for other reasons.  while there may have been some defensive consolidation among non-aco providers27 (e.g. to rebuff payer attempts to engage them in aco risk contracts), that would not be addressed by changing risk-sharing provisions among mssp participants.  mssp participation has also not been associated with detectable changes in referrals, as measured by leakage.  specifically, mssp participation has not been associated with evidence of acos effectively steering outpatient specialty referrals internally to aco specialists.28  while this area remains one in need of further investigation, we do not believe it is appropriate to conclude that the mssp has contributed to consolidation or anticompetitive control over referrals.  given that the mssp model presents greater opportunities for physician groups (for the reasons described above) one could even argue that the mssp could contribute to greater competition in provider markets, as long as it continues to favor lower-revenue organizational structures in its incentives.\n moreover, use of downside risk to deter gaming or anticompetitive behavior implicitly assumes that the financial gains from abusing the program are smaller than the gains from genuinely engaging in efforts to lower spending.  however, the opposite is more like likely to be the case.  attempts to lower spending are fraught with uncertainty, challenges, and offsetting costs, and have not been strongly rewarded in the mssp because of rebasing and low shared savings rates, whereas engaging in anticompetitive behavior to enhance ffs profits is likely to be far more predictable and lucrative.  a health system could participate in the mssp to take advantage of waivers to maintain or increase referrals for inpatient and\n 17\n specialty care without affecting total medicare spending (i.e., only causing a shift in care that favors the health system). such behavior would increase provider revenue without resulting in penalties under downside risk. thus, requiring downside risk is likely to selectively discourage acos joining the program for the right reasons, while acos joining the program for the wrong reasons may not be dissuaded by downside risk as much because the gains from regulatory relief may outweigh any potential losses.  we would favor measures to identify abuses directly over blunt uses of downside risk requirements that risk having unintended consequences.\n in summary, there is no evidence that downside risk has elicited greater savings in medicare aco programs, and imposing downside risk in a voluntary program with regionally adjusted benchmarks is likely to induce cost-increasing participation losses and higher administrative costs, without achieving the goals of stronger incentives and selectively deterring abuse.\n recommendation 5: eliminate downside risk requirements for lower-revenue acos by retaining track 1, eliminating the basic track, and allowing voluntary participation in track\n1+.  replace the \u00e2\u0080\u009cclinician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d basis for determining loss limits in track 1+ with the proposed \n revenue-based determination (aco revenue for medicare patients/total medicare spending for assigned population).\n recommendation 6: continue to require high-revenue acos to assume downside risk commensurate with the enhanced track but set the threshold for defining high revenue at a higher level corresponding to an integrated health system. also require downside risk of very large physician groups with market power. rather than rely solely on participant lists, use additional data on full organizational structure to determine organization-wide revenue for core practices responsible for attribution.\n we make the last part of recommendation 6 because we are concerned that acos, particularly high-revenue acos, may game revenue determinations if the aco participant lists are used to determine aco revenue, as proposed in the proposed rule.  for example, a large health system could include only its provider organizations or primary care practices in order to be judged as a low-revenue aco without significantly altering its attributed population.  for example, a large health system may own several hospitals and multiple physician groups, each billing under distinct tins.  or a health system may consist of a hospital system with a closely aligned provider organization billing under its own tin.  in such cases, which are common, the physician groups or provider organizations account for all or nearly all of the attribution but the hospitals and other facilities account for much of the revenue.  thus, an organization could include only its physician groups in its aco contract and lower its downside risk without changing its assigned population or its de facto governance (because of the common ownership or mutual interests shared by the health system and the physician groups).\n 18\n discourage a key strategy taken by acos\u00e2\u0080\u0094steering volume to more efficient providers and formalizing preferences with inclusion in contracts. we note that many acos with hospitals in participant lists are actually independent physician groups, and we categorized them as such in our evaluations.  these acos should be regarded as low-revenue to encourage their participation, but the proposed use of aco participant lists could categorize them as high- revenue, incentivizing them to drop such partnerships.  this could thwart healthy competition if such acos are able to get specialists and hospitals to compete on quality and efficiency for inclusion in aco contracts.\n therefore, we recommend using additional data sources, such as irs filings and pecos data, to determine the full organizational structure of the core practices that account for the bulk of the assigned population, and to use all tins and ccns in the full organization to determine organizational revenue.  we understand that pecos data are used to validate tins and ccns in aco participant lists, but these data can be additionally used by cms to determine the full organization to which aco participants belong.  in other work funded by the ahrq, we (a team of investigators at hms and the nber) have used these data sources to group independently billing tins and ccns into organizations or systems.  thus, although what we are suggesting would require some additional effort, we believe it would be feasible and would grow easier over time as such enhancements are made.  we would be happy to discuss with cms our experience in coalescing tins and ccns into organizations using these data sources.\n finally, we want to emphasize that we are recommending that revenue determinations be based ideally on the full organizational structure of the core practices that determine attribution.  if an aco includes physician groups that are part of a large health system, that aco should be considered high-revenue whether or not the other parts of the health system are included as participants.  if an aco includes physician groups that are financially independent of hospitals, that aco should be considered low-revenue (unless it is very specialty-heavy or has substantial market share), whether or not preferred hospital partners are included in the contracts.  that way, consolidation in provider markets is discouraged with more downside-risk in aco contracts, and partnerships or preferred networks that can support competition and do not cause commercial mark-ups are not discouraged.  the proposed use of only aco participant lists for revenue determinations could constitute a lost opportunity for discouraging price-increasing consolidation.\n strategies for addressing inadequate risk adjustment we agree with the proposed changes to account for increases in aco population risk scores and to implement measures to limit rewards for increases in coding intensity.  we do not, however, understand the rationale for limiting benchmark decreases to reflect decreases in risk scores.  capping downward adjustments for changes in patient risk introduces strong incentives for acos to engage in favorable risk selection (i.e., cream-skimming).\n 19\n resources available for quality improvement.  in particular, the aco cahps data, which include several measures of self-reported health and functional limitations, can be used to determine the extent to which increases in hcc scores reflect changes in coding vs. changes in health status.  discrepancies between the two could be used to limit benchmark increases due to coding increases in a more refined, aco-specific manner.  such adjustments could be instituted after an initial grace period (e.g., 3 years) that would permit coding increases that are unrelated to health status changes since they might reflect efforts by under-coding acos to achieve accurate coding. differences in spending predicted by hcc scores vs. cahps variables could also be used to identify acos that are undercoding relative to others at baseline and that should therefore be eligible for such a grace period.\n some of the clinical and social characteristics included in the cahps survey could also be used to further risk adjust aco benchmarks, and this information has been found to explain a meaningful amount of variation in aco spending after controlling for hcc score.29  we would caution, however, against adjustments for time-varying health status variables, as adjusting for health status weakens incentives for acos to improve patient health.\n an advantage of using acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 historical spending as the basis for benchmarks is that historical spending accounts for all differences in patient population risk between acos, whether measurable or not.  blending benchmarks with regional average makes program success depend heavily on risk adjustment for observable patient factors.  in the context of inadequate risk adjustment, regionally adjusted benchmarks would cause unjustified financial transfers from acos serving sicker and poorer patients to those serving healthier and wealthier patients.  unfortunately, risk adjustment will always be inadequate because all differences between patient populations can never be fully accounted for, particularly with available data sources.  it is not a question of whether risk adjustment is inadequate but the extent of its inadequacy.\n accordingly, in the future, should benchmarks be converged toward a regional average (again, we strongly recommend against regional adjustments at this juncture), we would urge cms to implement additional measures to ensure that acos are not penalized for serving higher-risk patients, independent of their efficiency or quality of care.  for example, an additional adjustment could take the form of a per-beneficiary care management fee that is higher for higher-risk patients, as in the comprehensive primary care plus program. to keep such a measure budget neutral and further encourage participation in the mssp, a small discount could be applied to ffs rates paid to all providers and redistributed as care management fees to acos, with higher payments to acos serving higher-risk patients regardless of their performance.  alternatively, aco benchmarks could simply be adjusted upward or downward by an additional amount (i.e., beyond adjustments for patient factors included in the risk-adjustment methodology) depending on whether their populations are higher- or lower-risk, respectively, than the regional average.\n finally, we are concerned that the proposed structure of the beneficiary incentive program could exacerbate favorable risk selection in the mssp.  specifically, because an aco must\n 20\n bear the costs of the incentive payments and because an aco must furnish an incentive payment to an eligible beneficiary each time the beneficiary receives a qualifying service (in accordance with section 1899(m)(2)(d)(iv) of the bipartisan budget act), the costs to an aco of serving higher-risk patients will be greater than the costs of serving lower-risk patients (since higher-risk patients use more services).  for this reason, we believe it is important for beneficiary incentive programs to be optional (as proposed), expect few acos to establish one, and do not expect the opportunity to establish one will attract acos into downside risk tracks.  we recommend close monitoring of acos that do implement beneficiary incentive programs.\n in general, we are in favor of patients sharing in the savings generated by their aco, whether in the form of direct payments, lower premiums, or in-kind benefits.  in the future, once more convergence in spending has occurred and benchmarks reliably reward more efficient providers, such mechanisms for sharing savings with beneficiaries could help to make more efficient providers more attractive to beneficiaries and foster competition to achieve savings (to compete for patients), as long as the benefits to beneficiaries are greater when aco savings are greater.  currently, linking the size of beneficiary payments to aco savings would tend to make the least efficient providers more attractive to beneficiaries since those providers are generating the most savings and would offer greater benefits. therefore, we agree with not establishing that link for now but believe it is worth revisiting once more convergence in spending occurs.  at that point, mechanisms to share savings with beneficiaries also could be used to mitigate incentives for acos to select low-risk patients by stipulating that higher-risk patients receive more of the savings than lower-risk patients.  acos engaging in favorable risk selection to generate savings would then become more attractive to the patients they may be trying to avoid.  we understand that the bipartisan budget act currently prohibits unequal payments to different beneficiaries.  we are suggesting this potential policy direction for future consideration.\n recommendation 7: eliminate cap on downward benchmark adjustments that result from decreases in risk scores to mitigate what would otherwise be strong incentives to engage in favorable risk selection. use aco cahps data to help distinguish between changes in coding intensity and changes in population health status.  should benchmarks be converged to a regional average in the future (not in the near term per recommendation 4), implement additional payments or benchmark adjustments so that acos are not penalized for serving higher-risk patients.\n 21\n for regional trend assessment. but small sample sizes can be handled easily with hierarchical statistical modeling approaches. the second is that aco populations may differ markedly from non-aco populations and thus have distinct expected spending trends.  but research to date has found that aco and non-aco populations are largely similar, on average.  moreover, this concerned is best addressed with rigorous risk adjustment of benchmark updates for an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population risk, as risk adjustment will not diminish incentives to save.  the third is that removing an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population will strengthen incentives for acos to select patients with favorable risks.  we believe this, too, is most appropriately addressed with risk adjustment.  no matter the updating methodology, acos will have incentives to select patients that are lower-risk in ways that are not accounted for by the risk adjustment methodology.  as we discuss above, we believe the risk adjustment methodology can be improved and additional steps can be taken to minimize incentives for favorable risk selection.\n therefore, we recommend removing an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed population from update determinations.  we generally agree with the proposed blending of concurrent national and regional growth rates to update benchmarks, with greater weight given to national growth rates for acos in areas where the ffs population served by other providers is limited.  but rather than use an arbitrary weighting scheme, we recommend the use of standard statistical approaches to estimation that account for random error from finite sample sizes. such methods are used, for example, to estimate excess readmission rates for the hospital readmissions reduction program.  specifically, at the end of each performance year, cms analysts could use claims data from the performance year and baseline year 3 (by3) to fit a simple multilevel model of total medicare spending per beneficiary as a function of county- level random intercepts and (time) slopes, excluding beneficiaries attributed to the aco of interest (the model would be estimated separately to determine each aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s update).  with empirical bayes estimation, the model will produce estimates of county-level spending trends that are shrunken toward the national trend when a county\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sample is small (whether because the county is small or because a large proportion of its population is served by the aco) and closer to the unshrunken county trend when the population in the county not assigned to the aco is large. for each aco, a weighted average of the estimated (shrunken) county trends can then be taken (reflecting the geographic distribution of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed patients) to arrive at the benchmark update for that aco.\n this approach would preserve incentives for acos to lower spending by removing their assigned population from update determinations while incorporating regional trends to the extent they can be reliably estimated and flexibly giving more weight to the national trend for acos that serve higher proportions of their service area.  we believe it is important initially to incorporate regional trend information to the extent possible because it is important initially to align benchmarks with acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 counterfactual spending to engender trust that acos will be rewarded for improvement.  after acos have had a few years to lower spending, benchmarks may later diverge from counterfactual spending without reactionary participation losses, as long as the divergence does not depend on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past performance, as discussed above.  this method achieves the goal of incorporating regional trends to the extent it can be reliably supported by the data.\n 22\n by including the rest of the aco population in update determinations (all but those assigned to the aco of interest), this approach to benchmark updating will still apply downward pressure on aco benchmarks at a rate that follows, but is less than, the rate of slowing in spending caused by the program.  thus, rebasing is not necessary to exert this downward pressure.  including the rest of the aco population in update determination will also introduce an element of competition in markets with multiple acos, as acos will be rewarded more if they lower spending more than their competitors.  this dynamic may become undesirably prominent in large service areas dominated by multiple acos.  in such markets, the weight given to the national trend will be limited because the market is large (allowing stable trend estimation), so that the update for an aco will be based almost entirely on the performance of its neighboring aco competitors.  thus, if all acos lower spending significantly and equally, none would be rewarded for doing so.  such cases are not currently common.  a more common scenario is the single aco dominating a small market.  for those cases, our recommended methodology would rely on national trends for updates.  but cms could monitor for cases of high aco penetration in large markets with multiple acos and use national trends for those markets, too.\n more generally, should the mssp expand to the point that the national non-aco population becomes small, we would recommend choosing a desirable rate at which benchmarks should grow and apply that rate to all acos.  the methodology we describe above is best suited to an expansion phase of the program.\n recommendation 8: remove an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed population from benchmark update determinations to preserve incentives for acos to lower spending. use multilevel statistical modeling approaches to estimate aco-specific update factors that reflect regional and national trends, with greater weight placed on national trends for aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that serve higher proportions of patients in their service area.  after a phase of program expansion, switch to using a desirable preset rate of benchmark growth applied to all acos.\n thank you for your consideration of our comments.  if you should wish to discuss any of our analyses or recommendations further, you can reach us

its august 9 proposed rule on the medicare shared savings aco program.\n\n | currently lead a track 1+ mssp aco, called north central arizona accountable care, llc, which started in january 2015. we are located in central arizona and have approximately 14,500 medicare beneficiaries.\n\n as you are aware, on august 9, 2018, cms released a proposed rule that would set a new direction for the mssp, referred to as the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3pathways to success\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 program. the proposal would improve the existing mssp in a number of ways, including:\n\n e lengthens agreement periods from three years to five years, promoting program stability; e ramps up risk more gradually for \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3basic\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 track acos;\n e provides an additional six to 18 months in a shared savings only model for 82 current acos that would otherwise be required to move to risk on january 1, 2019, if renewing participation;\n e makes basic level e (track 1+ equivalent) permanent; \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e3\u00b3 includes implementation of aco-specific payment rule waivers and beneficiary incentives;\n e provides flexibility to acos by allowing them to choose assignment annually regardless of risk-based status;\n e replaces the certified electronic health record technology (cehrt) use measure with attestation; and\n e adding waivers to the program.\n\n | agree that these are all significant improvements to the aco program. we do, however, have some significant concerns with the proposed rule, as | will identify below.\n\n areas of concern\n e shortening the time that acos have to take on downside financial risk, which will deter new entrants and drive existing acos to leave the program. the proposed rule reduces the onramp to taking on downside financial risk for new acos from six to only two years. based on a naacos survey conducted earlier this year, this will likely result in more than 70 percent of early acos leaving the program. further, research, including the hhs inspector general\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s, shows that it typically takes more than two years for acos to make the clinical and operational changes to prepare successfully for financial risk.\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e3\u00b3 cutting shared savings from 50 to 25 percent, which will deter new entrants. the proposed rule cuts shared savings in half for shared savings-only acos, severely undermining the business case to join the pathways to success program and begin the transition to value-based payment for new acos. acos are investing millions of dollars of their own capital to improve care; cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed reduction of the shared savings rate will preclude acos from generating a return on investment. closing off the pipeline of new acos will significantly hamper the overall shift to value-based payment.\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e3\u00b3 changing the regional benchmarking may deter new entrants and drive existing acos to leave the program. regions that have lower benchmarks (and typically lower costs/spend) are unfairly offset by the regions whereby benchmarks and cost/spend is much, much higher. this makes it extremely difficult for aco in regions with lower benchmarking to compete when the standard or baseline is significantly higher. in other words, in regions where spend and benchmarks are low, there is less opportunity to reduce costs and increase savings for cms. what would be the incentive for acos to participate in ssp in low-cost, low-spend regions? (for example, how does an acos with an $8000 benchmark complete [for shared savings] with an aco with a $25,000 benchmark?) there is significant investment in aco start-up and operations, so there would be little, if anything, to offset the costs of starting and/or maintaining an aco.\n\n e lack of transparency in benchmarking may deter new entrants and drive existing acos to leave the program. while the proposed rule states that the benchmarking would be overhauled to depict a more accurate representation of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s costs (regional or national service areas) there is little transparency in the methodology. transparency of the current methodology would allow acos to perform enhanced analytics and better forecast future savings/costs.\n\n e existing benchmarking adjustments/readjustments may deter new entrants and drive existing acos to leave the program. the current benchmarking adjustments do not keep current with the changes in acuity and health status of patients. the annual update to historical benchmark does not take into consideration disease progression and/or unforeseen circumstances or changes in health status and/or acuity. an increase in adjustment frequency would assist acos in being more successful.\n\n e include and recognize of all chronic conditions within cms-hcc risk adjustment model so all costs of chronic conditions are factored into cost and utilization of services. for example, cms-hcc does not\n risk adjust for chronic ischemic heart disease (without angina pectoris); yet, chronic ischemic vascular disease of the brain (i.e. cerebrovascular disease) and extremities (i.e. peripheral vascular disease) are recognized and risk adjusted as chronic conditions. ischemic heart (or coronary artery) disease remains the leading cause of death in the united states, but is not accounted for in risk scoring without accompanying angina. individuals with heart disease (with or without angina) have to be chronically managed and need the resources to do so...\n\n given the significant negative impact presented by the areas of concern above, naacos strongly urges cms to modify the above two provisions to: 1) increase the permitted time in basic levels a and b to at least three years and for acos that meet certain quality and cost standards allow additional years; 2) rescind the proposed decrease in shared savings and retain the existing 50 percent shared savings rate for shared savings only and low risk acos; 3) do not make changes to the regional benchmarking; 4) increase transparency in benchmarking; 5) increase frequency of benchmarking\n t t/readjust t; and 6) include/recognize all chronic conditions in the cms-hcc risk\n adjustment model.\n thank you for your time

care, including the use in acos\r\n\r\nin the absence of effective behavioral health assessment tools, the vast majority of people with mental health conditions go unidentified in primary care settings. that lack of identification and treatment in most cases leads to higher total medical costs and non-adherent patients.\r\n\r\nadditionally, failure to diagnose and effectively manage/treat patients in many cases results in increased risk of suicidality and addiction.\r\n\r\nthe use of validated assessment tools and integrated care can make acos far more clinically effective and financially sound.\r\n\r\nbehavior health is central to the development, prevention, treatment, and management of the preventable manifestations of diseases and health conditions (heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, unintentional injuries, pneumonia and influenza, diabetes, suicide, kidney diseases, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, hiv/aids) on which the u.s. spends about $1.5 trillion, 75% of our annual healthcare costs. 1\r\n\r\nthe connection between behavior and physical health is clear. it includes both behavioral risk factors (like smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity), behavioral interventions like stress management, behavioral sleep management, behavioral pain management, and psychological interventions addressing quality of life. people with common physical health conditions (diabetes, cardiac, obesity, etc.) have higher rates of mental health issues, with unipolar depression being the 2nd largest contributor to disease burden in countries like the u.s. more than heart disease, alcohol use, and traffic accidents. primary care settings provide about half of all mental health care for common psychiatric disorders. unfortunately, medical providers often lack the time or training to help patients manage behavioral health problems in evidence-based ways beside offering prescriptions for medication.\r\n\r\nwhat is integrated behavioral health care?\r\n\r\nbroadly, integrated behavioral health care can be described as any situation in which behavioral health and medical providers work collaboratively. also termed; integrated health, co-coordinated care, seamless care, comprehensive care, or integrated primary care, this approach comes in a number of models, varying in level of integration and dependent upon the resources of the health care practice or system.\r\n\r\nwhen behavioral health practitioners, such as health psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, clinical social workers, or health coaches are integrated into the medical setting, whether in-person or virtually, they are able to assess the global health of the patient and work cooperatively with the medical provider; truly providing patient-centered and comprehensive health care. according to cj peek and the national integration academy councils lexicon for behavioral health and primary care (2013),\r\nintegrated primary care is the care that results from a practice team of primary care and behavioral health clinicians, working together with patients and families, using a systematic and cost-effective approach to provide patient-centered care for a defined population. this care may address mental health and substance abuse conditions, health behaviors (including their contribution to chronic medical illnesses), life stressors and crises, stress-related physical symptoms, and ineffective patterns of health care utilization.\r\nultimately, early assessment and treatment of behavioral health issues leads to better outcomes for both mental and physical health while decreasing total cost of care.\r\n\r\n1.agency for healthcare research and quality:

that cehrt use should not be limited to a 90-day period and that the current cehrt requirement is to have at least 50% of ecs within an advanced apm use cehrt, i do not believe that the proposed or

implemented in 2019 before the self-selected reporting period of attesting to aco measure 11. 2- cms proposed in the pathways to success (mssp aco overhaul) proposed rule to eliminate the aco-11 measure. this currently looks at how many ecs within the aco meet the base requirements of the pi category. rather, cms proposes to align mssp and pathways to success acos cehrt requirements with the cehrt definition required for apms under qpp. basically then, cms proposes 75% of the ecs within an apm use cehrt if the apm is considered an advanced apm, and 50% for mips apms. my interpretation is this proposed change pretty much takes away to certainty of how long cehrt needs to be in place. my request is that cms clarify all of this in the 2018 mssp/pathways to success aco final rule so healthcare organizations have a clear understanding of expectations and can plan accordingly, especially when participating in more than one regulatory program, in my case pi and qpp. by doing so,

administrator verma,\n the american academy of neurology (aan) is the world\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s largest neurology specialty society representing more than 34,000 neurologists and clinical neuroscience professionals. the aan is dedicated to promoting the highest quality patient-centered neurologic care. a neurologist is a physician with specialized training in diagnosing, treating, and managing disorders of the brain and nervous system. these disorders affect one in six people and include conditions such as multiple sclerosis (ms), alzheimer\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s disease, parkinson\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s disease, stroke, migraine, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, als, and spinal muscular atrophy.\n\n the aan appreciates the opportunity to comment on the centers for medicare and medicaid services\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 (cms) proposed redesign of the medicare shared savings program (mssp). the aan is concerned with the direction of the proposal and urges cms to reconsider efforts to redesign the mssp tracks and limit access to one-sided risk accountable care organizations (acos). the aan recommends that cms slow the pace of regulatory change to the aco program and reassess proposals that would limit neurologist participation in acos.\n\n the aan strongly opposes cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to redesign the mssp tracks and limit aco participation in one-sided risk models to just two years. the aan urges cms, at a minimum, to maintain the availability of one-sided risk models in the mssp to two three-year agreement periods. acos need enough time to optimize processes in the early stages of their development and should not be expected to prematurely take on downside risk before they are ready. this idea is supported by the data. a recent study published by avalere health indicated that the costliest acos are new acos and that acos tend to generate savings over time.' notably, acos generated a net savings after their fourth year in the mssp,\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 indicating that cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed two-year limit is an unrealistic\n\n\n ' seidman, josh, et al. \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3medicare accountable care organizations have increased federal spending contrary to projections that they would produce net savings.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 avalere health, 29 mar. 2018, ? tbid\n timeframe for acos to be expected to share in program losses. prematurely assuming downside risk can be especially problematic for providers in rural areas and safety-net organizations, for whom patients are generally more vulnerable and harder to effectively manage.\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s program data provides further evidence supporting the value of one-sided risk acos. in 2017, after accounting for shared savings payments, one-sided risk acos saved the medicare program $291 million.* contrary to the premise underlying cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to limit one-sided risk models, this data shows that one-sided risk acos were the largest generators of savings from the mssp in 2017. given this data, the aan is troubled by the projected negative impact that cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal would have on aco availability. by cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own analysis, more than 100 acos are expected to drop out of the mssp in the next ten years if the proposed redesign is implemented. furthermore, the aan believes the proposal to limit gain-sharing to 25%, down from 50%, for acos participating in one-sided risk models will compound the detrimental impact of compelling acos to prematurely assuming downside risk. the combined effect of the proposed limitations on gain-sharing and on one-sided risk models disincentivizes new market entry and could allow established acos to grow to dominate their regions, creating new market oligopolies.\n\n moreover, the aan is troubled by cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s deliberate effort to decrease the availability of acos, as acos are one of the few alternative payment models (apms) that are currently available for neurologist participation. neurologists should have the opportunity to participate in the american medical system as it evolves toward value-based care through advanced apms and mips apms. neurologists need more opportunities to participate in alternative payment models, but the current proposal will result in fewer opportunities for neurologists to participate in the transition to value-based care. the aan finds cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal especially concerning given the secretary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s general rejection of the apms recommended by the physician-focused payment model technical advisory committee (ptac).\n\n given the demonstrated value of one-sided risk acos and the limited availability of apms to neurologists, the aan strongly believe that cms should permit alternative payment model (apm) entities to take on less financial risk to qualify as an advanced apm. we encourage cms to study the potential for certain aco models with one-sided risk to qualify as advanced apms.\n inclusion of these models as advanced apms would make aco participation more attractive to physicians and is preferable to advancing proposals that would limit aco participation.\n\n additionally, the aan urges cms to slow the pace of change to the mssp regulations. acos have become remarkably complex in a short period of time. early adopters of the mssp have expressed dissatisfaction with cms repeatedly changing the program requirements and structure.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 the rate of change has been especially problematic for rural and small health systems, who continue to have difficulty with the regulatory burden associated with continuous changes to the mssp. the aan recommends that cms provide acos with regulatory relief by postponing efforts to substantially change the currently available aco tracks.\n\n although the aan is concerned with the pace of change to the mssp and the proposed redesign, the aan believes that there are several beneficial ideas contained in the proposed rule. the aan applauds cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to recognize the value that neurologists and other specialists provide\n\n\n 32017 shared savings program (ssp) accountable care organizations (aco) puf.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 centers for medicare and medicaid services, 30 aug. 2018.\n\n 4 kocot,

supports the adjustments to the benchmarking methodology that can lead to more accurate determinations of savings and losses. this proposal will help to encourage high performing acos to remain in the program and not be forced out due to inaccurate and unfair benchmarks.\n the aan also appreciates cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to allow for additional flexibility in aco

to the aco unless they receive one primary care service from a primary care physician participating with the aco each year.\r\n\r\nwhile in an earlier era, this may have been seen as a protection for patients. however, nurse practitioners have consistently demonstrated high quality care within the level of their training. there is no literature demonstrating inferiority of patient outcomes in in

initiatives, ehealth, quality, rural health, telehealth\n share\n the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) has launched the agency\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first rural health strategy to help improve access to high quality, affordable healthcare in rural communities. the strategy is intended to provide a proactive and strategic focus on healthcare issues across rural america to ensure the nearly one in five individuals who live in these areas have access to care that meets their needs.\n\n cms is organizing and focusing its efforts to apply a rural lens to the vision and work of the agency. the cms rural health strategy supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 goal of putting patients first. through its implementation and continued stakeholder engagement, this initiative will enhance the positive impacts cms policies have on beneficiaries who live in rural, underserved areas. this administration understands that one of the keys to ensuring that those who call rural america home are able to achieve their highest level of health is to advance policies and programs that address their unique healthcare needs.\n\n background\n approximately 60 million people live in rural areas across the united states \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 including millions of medicare and medicaid beneficiaries. cms recognizes the many obstacles that rural americans face when accessing healthcare services, including a fragmented healthcare delivery system, stretched and diminishing rural health workforce, unaffordability of insurance, and lack of access to specialty services and providers. cms developed this strategy to focus on areas where the\n https://www.cms.gov/| /fact-sheets/ rural-health-strategy 116\n 10/4/2018 cms rural health strategy | cms agency can better serve individuals in rural areas and work to avoid unintended consequences of policy and program implementation for these communities.\n\n summary\n the new strategy announced today builds on several overarching cms priorities launched by the trump administration, including reducing regulatory burdens and empowering patients and providers to make more informed decisions about their healthcare. in addition, the cms rural health strategy underscores cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 commitment to combat our nation\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s opioid epidemic given its disproportionate impact on rural communities.\n\n the cms rural health council -- an agency-wide panel of experts formed in 2016 -- developed the cms rural health strategy with input from 14 listening sessions with rural health care providers, consumers, and other stakeholders. the council gathered real world evidence on the challenges and local solutions associated with providing high quality healthcare in rural communities to inform the development of a strategic plan to improve healthcare in rural america.\n\n representing an agency-wide mindset, the strategy aligns with goals of is the approaches the health resources and services administration\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s (hrsa) federal office of rural health policy (forhp), which was created in 1987 to advise the secretary of the u.s. department of health and human services on healthcare issues impacting rural communities, including:\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd access to quality healthcare and health professionals;\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e3\u00b3 viability of rural hospitals; and\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd effect of the department\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed rules and regulations, including policies under medicare and medicaid, on access to and financing of healthcare in rural areas.\n\n the cms rural health strategy identifies five specific objectives intended to achieve the agency\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s vision for equitable rural health:\n\n\n1. apply a rural lens to cms programs and policies\n\n cms recognizes the need to look at policymaking, program design, and strategic planning through a specific lens to promote health equity among all populations that it serves. the first objective focuses on areas where the agency can better meet the needs of rural populations and avoid unintended consequences of policy and program implementation for these communities. to accomplish this, cms will:\n\n i\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u00a9\u00e2\u00bc.\n\n https://www.cms.gov/ t-sheets/ rural-health-strategy 216\n 10/4/2018 cms rural health strategy | cms \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd apply a newly-developed checklist to relevant policies, procedures, and initiatives that impact rural communities; and \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd identify and accelerate evidence-based practices to improve access to services and providers in rural communities.\n\n\n2. improve access to care through provider engagement and support\n the second strategic objective is to improve access to care through provider engagement and support. this objective focuses on:\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd maximizing scope of practice;\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd providing technical assistance to health care providers to ensure that they can fully participate in cms programs; and\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd identifying new ways to overcome patient barriers to access, such as a lack of transportation.\n\n\n3. advance telehealth and telemedicine\n\n the third objective focuses on the advancement of telehealth and telemedicine. telehealth has been proven to be a successful tool to improve access to care and help meet the needs of rural areas that lack sufficient health care services. to help promote the use of telehealth, cms will seek to reduce barriers stakeholders identified such as reimbursement, cross-state licensure issues, and the administrative and financial burden to implement telemedicine.\n\n\n4. empower patients in rural communities to make decisions about\n their health care\n cms will leverage existing rural communication networks to empower patients with the information and tools to engage in their health care and will explore ways to support enhanced access through the use of health information technology (health it). cms will work to ensure information is reaching rural beneficiaries by:\n\n collaborating with rural communication networks to develop and disseminate easy-to-understand materials;\n supporting the adoption of health it and the development of infrastructure to enhance patient access to health information; and\n fostering engagement of rural beneficiaries in their health care.\n\n 5, leverage partnerships to achieve the goals of the cms rural health strategy\n a key objective of the strategy is to leverage partnerships with stakeholders nationally, as well as at the regional, state, and local levels.\n to accomplish this, cms will:\n\n https://www.cms.gov/ t-sheets/ rural-health-strategy 3/6\n 10/4/2018 cms rural health strategy | cms\n explore opportunities with the office of the national coordinator for health information technology and other federal partners to promote interoperability of health information and increase the use of electronic health records among individuals and their healthcare providers and care teams.\n\n work with federal and state partners to understand and evaluate the impacts of cms programs on rural communities, and develop recommendations.\n\n meet with health plan representatives to discuss challenges and strategies to increase participation in rural areas.\n work with the centers for disease control and prevention to increase\n the focus on maternal health, behavioral health, substance abuse, and the integration of behavioral health and primary care.\n\n work with state medicaid agencies and other state partners to advance rural health strategies for medicaid eligible individuals, including people with disabilities, dual-eligible beneficiaries, and people with substance use disorders.\n\n cms will continue to collaborate with agency partners across the u.s.\n department of health and human services (hhs), including health resources and services administration\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s (hrsa) federal office of rural health policy, to implement this strategy.\n\n for more information on the cms rural health strategy, please visit:\n

beneficiaries:\r\n1.we support voluntary assignment initiative. we think this will improve beneficiary engagement.\r\n2.we think this should be limited to primary care physicians (pcps) only. our reasons are based on alignment of pcps with population health. we believe significant infrastructure investment has taken place to strengthen the ability for pcps to be successful in population health. this will continue to help achieve cms goals of better care at lower cost.\r\n3.we do not support beneficiary alignment to arnps and pas. we are concerned that expanding the beneficiary alignment to arnps and pas would be disrupting. these providers often go through significantly less training and education and as such have limited fund of knowledge and experience. this is likely to increase fragmentation in care. these providers currently work under physician supervision and learn and grow in knowledge and experience in a supervised environment. this is protective for the beneficiaries and providers. if these providers are allowed to have direct assignment, we are concerned for patient safety, fragmentation, polypharmacy and long term increase in cost.\r\n4.we support choice for acos in selecting assignment methods. we are encouraged by cms giving the option of prospective assignment with annual retrospective adjustment.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n

verma,\r\naugusta care partners is an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our community.\r\nsincerely,\r\ntimothy j. kane,

proposed rule\r\ndear administrator verma,\r\naugusta care partners is an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our community.\r\nsincerely,\r\njohn atlee snyder do facp\r\nstuarts draft, va\r\naugusta care partners     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n

medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizationspathways to success\r\n\r\ndear administrator verma,\r\n\r\non behalf of our communitys accountable care organization, community health provider alliance (chpa), we would like to take this opportunity to express the interest federally qualified health centers (referred to here as fqhcs, or health centers) have in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\n\r\nour aco is a non-profit community-based organization comprised solely of fqhcs in colorado. our health centers are non-profit, community-directed providers that serve as the primary medical home for 790,000 patients in our state, including more than 1 in 7 coloradoans.\r\n\r\nwe welcome the opportunity to respond to cms pathways to success nprm. while we believe the proposed rule includes important steps toward increased success, there are several areas where we raise caution and seek clarification. in summary, our comments will focus on the following areas:\r\nhealth centers are important partners in accountable care arrangements, producing cost savings for the system and enhanced quality of care for beneficiaries and look forward to continuing this work together.\r\ncms should invest in a more gradual pathway to increased levels of financial risk for low-revenue provider-led accountable care organizations (acos), with consideration made to those acos comprised solely of fqhcs.\r\nmany fqhcs, because they provide care to some of the most underserved communities in the country, require additional investment to prepare for two-sided risk arrangements.\r\nincreased flexibility in the ability to provide telehealth services will support health centers participating in the pathways to success program.\r\na more appropriate benchmarking process will support participating health centers in delivering the best care for the vulnerable populations they serve.\r\ncms should be mindful of inadvertently causing cherry-picking of patients by allowing acos to provide beneficiary incentives.\r\n\r\nwe are in opposition to a few key aspects of the recent proposed pathways to success rule, in particular the agency's proposal to cut acos shared savings rates below 50 percent, reduce the time in a shared savings-only model from six to two years, and application of a +/- 3 percent risk adjustment cap across an extended agreement period.\r\n\r\nour opposition to and rationale for these proposed changes are outlined in the attached document.\r\n\r\nthese proposed changes will harm patients and providers by limiting improvements in savings and quality acos provide, while slowing progress made in transitioning to value-base payments. our aco has made a significant investment in funding the operations to support the mssp, and a reduction in potential savings will greatly impact our ability to reinvest in our care models/teams and will significantly limit our ability to generate enough capital to meet the repayment mechanism requirements. as a non-profit, low revenue aco, our aco may be forced out of the mssp because we will lack the capital required for the repayment mechanism. our initial intention was to build up that

accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success\ndear administrator verma,\non behalf of our community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accountable care organization, community health provider alliance (chpa), we would like to take this opportunity to express the interest federally qualified health centers (referred to here as fqhcs, or \u00e2\u0080\u009chealth centers\u00e2\u0080\u009d) have in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\nour aco is a not-for-profit community-based organization comprised solely of fqhcs in colorado.  our health centers are non-profit, community-directed providers that serve as the primary medical home for 790,000 patients in our state, including more than 1 in 7 coloradoans.\nwe welcome the opportunity to respond to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pathways to success nprm.  while we believe the proposed rule includes important steps toward increased success, there are several areas where we raise caution and seek clarification.  in summary, our comments will focus on the following areas:\nhealth centers are important partners in accountable care arrangements, producing cost savings for the system and enhanced quality of care for beneficiaries and look forward to continuing this work together.\ncms should invest in a more gradual pathway to increased levels of financial risk for low-revenue provider-led accountable care organizations (acos), with consideration made to those acos comprised solely of fqhcs.\nmany fqhcs, because they provide care to some of the most underserved communities in the country, require additional investment to prepare for two-sided risk arrangements.\nincreased flexibility in the ability to provide telehealth services will support health centers participating in the pathways to success program.\na more appropriate benchmarking process will support participating health centers in delivering the best care for the vulnerable populations they serve.\ncms should be mindful of inadvertently causing \u00e2\u0080\u009ccherry-picking\u00e2\u0080\u009d of patients by allowing acos to provide beneficiary incentives.\nwe are in opposition to a few key aspects of the recent proposed pathways to success rule, in particular the agency's proposal to cut acos shared savings rates below 50 percent, reduce the time in a shared savings-only model from six to two years, and application of a +/- 3 percent risk adjustment cap across an extended agreement period.\nthese proposed changes will harm patients and providers by limiting improvements in savings and quality acos provide, while slowing progress made in transitioning to value-base payments. our aco has made a significant investment in funding the operations to support the mssp, and a reduction in potential savings will greatly impact our ability to reinvest in our care models/teams and will significantly limit our ability to generate enough capital to meet the repayment mechanism requirements.  as a non-profit, low revenue aco, our aco may be forced out of the mssp because we will lack the capital required for the repayment mechanism. our initial intention was to build up that capital over the course of 6 years under the current system, but that timeline is drastically reduced with the proposed changes.\nwe appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recognition of the additional time many provider-led acos may need to transition to higher levels of two-sided risk by allowing provider-led acos to cycle through the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasic\u00e2\u0080\u009d track for two agreement periods.  however, this still only allows provider-led acos two years without taking on financial risk. due to the pace of data sharing and the imperative to transform care models, we recommend cms allow provider-led acos an even more gradual pathway to two-sided risk. specifically, we suggest cms allow provider-led acos a minimum of three years in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasic\u00e2\u0080\u009d track in an upside-only arrangement.\nwhile we support incorporating regional expenditures in the benchmark established for an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first agreement, we are concerned that the two proposed policies to limit the magnitude of the adjustment undermines the policy goals. as cms has recognized, the incorporation of regional expenditures provides an aco with a benchmark that is more reflective of ffs spending in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s region than a benchmark based solely on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own historical expenditures. this approach creates stronger financial incentives for acos that have been successful in reducing expenditures to remain in the program, thus improving program sustainability. it also allows cms to better capture the cost experience in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s region, the health status and socio-economic dynamics of the regional population, and location-specific medicare payments when compared to using national ffs expenditures.\nwe disagree that higher weights for the regional adjustment results in potential windfall gains to lower-cost acos. those gains are not windfalls but compensate lower-cost acos for the work invested in practices to reduce the overall costs of care for medicare beneficiaries. in fact, a lower-cost aco composed of fqhcs may have higher expenditures for primary care due to the prospective payment system (pps) methodology as compared to regional expenditures for primary care services that are generally reimbursed under the medicare fee schedule.  the risk adjustment benchmarking cap uniquely will harm our non-profit fqhc-based aco. in the past, our coding processes were fairly rudimentary which is evidenced by our unusually low risk adjustment scores and unusually low benchmarks given the patient population we serve.  our network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understanding of risk adjustment is relatively new, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve implemented coding improvement efforts to more accurately reflect the acuity of our patients and to better capture hcc codes annually.  the proposed limit of +/-3% would mitigate our efforts to improve in these crucial areas which impact our ability to be successful in the mssp.\non the other hand, we support a number of proposals in the rule and encourage cms to finalize its proposals to: 1) move to five-year agreement periods; 2) reduce burdens related to quality reporting; 3) expand the use of waivers for telehealth and skilled nursing facility stays; and 4) provide flexibility with choosing assignment methodology regardless of risk model.\nthe proposed provisions related to allowing acos to provide and be reimbursed for telehealth services, will help health centers continue to meet the unique needs of their communities in the most cost-efficient ways. however, while the preamble to the proposed rule outlines the process for which a provider can be reimbursed for his or her telehealth work, it is not clear how this new provision will impact health centers.  health centers are currently limited to serving as originating sites only and are not able to provide or be reimbursed as a distant site in medicare.  the preamble and proposed rule make reference to \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysicians and providers\u00e2\u0080\u009d using the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tin, however it is not clear if this provision will allow health centers to fully participate in the telehealth provisions.   we encourage cms to clarify the language in the proposed rule in order to clearly allow health centers to provide this valuable service through their work in an aco.\nfqhcs are unique in that they are both required by federal law and committed to serving everyone that seeks care and must serve communities most in need of care. they turn no patient away, regardless of income, insurance status, risk, or complexity. this open-door policy is a defining feature of the health center mission of providing quality, affordable access to care to all who need it. additionally, beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 freedom of choice is an important way for practices and payers, including medicare, to gauge practice effectiveness and the demand for access to health care services in specific communities. should cms decide to allow acos to incentivize beneficiaries, it should implement safeguards to ensure that higher-revenue acos do not inadvertently attract healthier patients, potentially skewing quality metrics and leaving sicker patients with fewer options.\nthank you again for your work on behalf of patients and providers to advance value-based payment. we appreciate your interest in sustaining the success of medicare acos and creating an environment where providers are encouraged to enter into value-based payment arrangements and help patients receive high-quality, coordinate care.\nsincerely,\nkerry cogan, ceo\ncommunity health provider alliance\n600 grant street, suite 800\ndenver, co 80203\n\n\n", "0189":

\u00e2\u00a72. summary of the major provisions\u0007\ntext:\nwe propose to establish a new program requirement related to the adoption of certified electronic health record technology (cehrt) by eligible clinicians participating in the aco. specifically, we propose to require acos to certify, upon application to the program and annually thereafter, that the percentage of eligible clinicians participating in the aco who use cehrt to document and communicate clinical care to their patients or other health care providers meets or exceeds a specified threshold. for acos that are participating in a track (or payment model within a track) that meets the financial risk standard to be an advanced apm, we further propose to align this requirement with the cehrt use requirement for advanced apms under the quality payment program. in conjunction with this proposal, we propose to discontinue the use of the double-weighted quality measure assessing the percentage of eligible clinicians that successfully meet the promoting interoperability performance category base score (use of cehrt, aco\u00e2\u0080\u009311) in order to reduce burden and align with the requirements of the quality payment program.\u0007\ncomment:\nwe support program revisions that reduce burden and align with quality payment program requirements.\u0007\n\npage 41908 \u00e2\u00a7promoting interoperability\u0007\ntext:\nconsistent with the call in the 21st century cures act for interoperable access, exchange, and use of health information, the final rule entitled, 2015 edition health information technology (health it) certification criteria, 2015 edition base electronic health record (ehr) definition, and onc health it certification program modifications (2015 edition final rule) (80 fr 62601) under 45 cfr part 170 24 focuses on the 2015 edition of health it certification criteria that support patient care, patient participation in care delivery, and electronic exchange of interoperable health information. the 2015 edition final rule, which was issued on october 16, 2015, is expected to improve interoperability by adopting new and updated vocabulary and content standards for the structured recording and exchange of health information and to facilitate the accessibility and exchange of data by including enhanced data export, transitions of care, and application programming interface capabilities. these policies are relevant to assessing the use of cehrt under the quality payment program and other value based payment initiatives.\u0007\ncomment:\nwhile application programming interfaces (apis) are advancement in technology/software solutions, they are not a panacea, and may still pose interoperability challenges.  without guidance, each vendor/provider is free to create their own (potentially proprietary) version of their api, or implement different api versions that are not compatible and therefore unintentionally block information exchange.  third party patient apps intended to download the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical information may utilize older versions of apis for their app, which could prevent providers with more current api versions in their ehr system from effectively sharing patient data.\nwe strongly recommend that cms and onc collaborate to cite standards based api

staffing.  we would like to see cms provide a benchmark range to an applying aco during the application cycle so the aco can also assess their readiness and likelihood of success.\nbelow we make comments specific to sections of the proposed rule.\nbeneficiary incentives (page 309, section c, 2nd paragraph).\nin this section, cms proposes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe mirror the language in the proposed regulation text noting that \u00e2\u0080\u009ca qualifying service is a primary care service\u00e2\u0080\u009d a defined in 425.20, with respect to which coinsurance applies under part b.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nmost acos agree that the best practice for beneficiary engagement in wellness is to encourage them to utilize the medicare annual wellness visit (awv). this allows for a face to face with their primary doctor where the doctor and patient can discuss beneficiary concerns, provide or refer for preventative services, check on at-risk conditions such as diabetes, and establish a care plan. many acos that promote this visit notice an improvement in mssp quality measures.  however, cms does not apply a co-insurance to the awv, which, according to this definition, would disallow this important visit to be the focus of an incentive plan.  please consider a revised definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cqualifying service\u00e2\u0080\u009d so that incenting the awv can be an option.\nprogram measures and quality data \u00e2\u0080\u0093 part d (p 434-443\nwe understand the logic of aligning programs and initiatives, but at this time, bringing in quality measures for opioids does not seem like the right decision. the cms focus right now is to get acos to take on more risk, so let them focus on the key drivers that impact their population in their community, instead of side-tracking with this potentially large initiative that will no doubt take resources for which most acos do not currently have funding. each aco is unique in their participant mix, their resources, their aligned population, and their region. what works for one does not always work for another. bringing in quality measures that are this specific will detract acos from focusing on what does work for them.\nas an alternative, cms could provide acos with learning webinars for provider and aco education, and various tools and data for acos to incorporate into their current structure for care management and patient engagement. to augment this effort, please consider allowing access to part 2 data so acos can create appropriate and relevant clinical models to address the opioid situation.\naco-11 and promoting interoperability (page 443-454).\nin general, we have no concerns about the difference between 50% or 75% requirement between the different tracks.  it is reasonable to expect the higher tracks to have a higher cehrt adoption rate. however, we would ask that you delay this change because of inaccurate results from quality payment program. acos receive a supplemental aco11 file with their annual settlement packet. in the packet we received in august 2018 for the 2017 performance year, our aco11 file was incomplete, in that it did not contain all of our participating providers; in fact, it was missing about half.  due to the incomplete data, we were not able to measure where we truly are in terms of percentages for what is now called promoting interoperability.\nit would be great for a track 3 (enhanced) aco to tell a participant that they no longer need to sign into qpp and attest to promoting interoperability, specifically because the other quality reporting is done at the aco level and pi is the only category that requires a participant-initiated submission. however, without detail on how an aco would confirm this requirement for the purposes of an attestation, we are concerned that moving to an aco certification process may inadvertently place the aco in a non-compliant situation. is the standard for confirming a participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s status simple enough for an aco to confirm? many acos have participants that are on different ehrs. our aco would be confident in attesting to the ehr used by our employed clinicians, but we would have to do a separate analysis for each of our independent practices. the cehrt definition at 42 cfr 414.1305 seems to be more than an aco could confidently assess on their own. for example, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that we have the expertise to say that any given participant has a sufficient security plan [42 cfr 414.1305 (1)(ii)(a) (7)(c)]. we would ask that you better clarify the operational expectations for this attestation so that acos can confirm they are able to confidently attest.\nregarding the retiring of aco11 in favor of an attestation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if a new entity wants to join mssp and is willing to start in basic track e or enhanced, during application, the entity will have to survey every participant to ensure they meet for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attesting to cehrt.  this will add to the time investment of an application, especially for an entity with a high number of independent participants.  it might be reasonable to allow track e and enhanced to come in at 50% for the first performance year and then go to 75% in the second; it would be the equivalent of the pay for reporting in the quality measures in performance year 1.\n\n\n", "0191": "to medicare,\r\n\r\nas the medical director of a primary care physician led aco we are excited to have the opportunity to move into an enhanced aco track from our

http://www.regulations.gov re: medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success\n dear administrator verma: thank you for this opportunity to provide comments on the medicare shared savings program (mssp). as an electronic health records developer based in verona, wisconsin, we at epic have significant experience supporting accountable care organizations (acos) using our software as they participate in mssp, as well as in other cms quality reporting programs. our experience informs our feedback here on the following specific proposals by cms:\nii.a.4.c proposals for permitting annual election of beneficiary assignment methodology \n for acos to use reports and dashboards in their ehr to get an overall picture of their beneficiary populations and to identify and act on health trends, they need to be able to accurately match patients between the roster and the ehr. acos need a minimum amount of demographic information to definitively determine that a patient on the roster is the same person as a patient in the ehr. the demographic information most commonly received on shared savings program roster files is name, date of birth, and sex. these three data points are not sufficient to confidently match or create a new patient record within the ehr. cms should also include the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full address (street, city, state, and zip code) and phone number in a consistently formatted file to allow acos to effectively and quickly match patients on the roster to patients in the ehr.\nii.c.3.a beneficiary notifications \n\n public comments on proposed pathways to success 2\n sharing would support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stated goal of ensuring patient access to program information, while minimizing the regulatory burden for individual providers.\nii.e.5 program data and quality measures \n we are committed to supporting organizations as they seek to combat the opioid crisis. we note that cms proposes two opioid quality measures that use a threshold of 120 morphine milligram equivalent (mme) per day. cms should work with nqf, the measure developer, to change the threshold to 90 mme per day to align with the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain1.\n we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made these suggestions to help further the support that ehrs can provide to acos as they participate in mssp and pursue cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed pathway to success.\n thank you for your consideration. sincerely,\n sasha termaat

to success\n dear administrator verma:\n buena vida y salud aco (track 1 aco), rgv aco health providers, llc (track 3 aco), rio grande valley health alliance, llc (track 3 aco), and sunshine aco (track 3 aco), from the rio grande valley  in  texas,  are  pleased  to  submit  collective  comments  in  response  to  the  proposed  rule, pathways to success.\n we  congratulate  you  and  cms  for  proposing  regulatory  transformation  and  a  redesigned  health care  delivery  system  so  that  it  is  sustainable  for  the  long-term.    we  strongly  believe  that  such reform  is  about  people  working  with  the  most  vulnerable  people,  our  patients.    thus,  any transformation should be completed with care, dignity, and respect.  as physicians, we are creative problem solvers.  we are more than willing to take on the task of health care delivery reform.  we need such modifications to include our patients and community.  therefore, we wholeheartedly ask cms to consider the long game.  accountable care organizations have tremendous potential for true, ground up, transformation that can support the future.  we respectfully ask cms to provide us with the tools and time needed to help create success.\n mutually, we hereby recommend and or support the following:\n calculation of loss sharing limit for basic tracks - level e participation level (track 1+) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 acos should be allowed to participate at this level of risk, long  term  (multiple  contracts).    as  acos improve efficacy of health care delivery, they  will  reduce  overall  costs.    thus,  their  benchmarks  will  decline,  creating  very  small margins.  with smaller margins, it will be more challenging to achieve shared savings.  we think  it  is  important  for  acos  to  stay  in  the  mssp  program.    acos  bring  value  in  care coordination, improvement and maintained quality  metrics,  along  with  cost  containment. not every aco will be able to move to medicare advantage, nor will every aco be able to accept capitation type payments. therefore, level e participation has probability of meeting the long-term goals of the mssp program.\n\n\n 2\n permitting annual election of beneficiary assignment methodology - we  agree  with  the  proposal  to  choose  between  prospective  assignment  or  preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation for all aco tracks with an annual election process.\n monitoring financial performance lower growth in medicare part a & b expenditures (part of the triple aim) - monitoring aco financial performance - in the proposal, cms is recommending proceeding with early termination for any aco that has a negative performance outside the corridor for 2 performance years.  this is unreasonable. acos should have an opportunity to establish a corrective action plan.  additionally, due to the timing of receipt of final reconciliation, an aco will not have sufficient time to make and implement adjustments.  it is important for an aco  to  have  the  final  reconciliation  information  to  make  decisions,  because  final benchmarks can increase or decrease (which is not always predicable).  for example: the aco receives its year 1 final performance reports in august of year 2 and finds out their losses  are  outside  the  corridor.    the  aco  may  have  insufficient  time  to  affect  year  2 performance.  it will be able to initiate a corrective action plan for the remainder of year 2 and for the full year 3.  if it has losses outside the corridor in year 2, the aco will receive this final information in august of year 3.  the full accounting of the results of the corrective action plan will be assessed in august of year 4.  also, quarterly data should not be used for the determination of financial performance due to the natural seasonal variations in health care  spending  and  utilization.    due  to  the  natural  time  frame  to  implement  and  assess corrective actions, we recommend non-renewal of the next contract cycle rather than early termination.\n aco repayment mechanism for acos in two-sided model - termination - voluntary early termination - if the aco voluntarily terminates from the mssp program, the  aco  should  be  held  responsible  for  a  prorated  repayment  based  on  the  date  of termination.\n - involuntary termination (terminated by cms) - if cms terminates an aco, the aco should not be held responsible for any losses.  the aco was willing to continue to participate and meet obligations, but cms chose to terminate. therefore, it should be cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responsibility to address the loss.\n participation tracks election of msr/mlr by acos - we  agree  with  the  proposal  to  offer  acos  in  a  two-sided  model  the  option  to  choose msr/mlr.\n - we suggest the basic track one-sided model have the msr modified to a fixed 2% msr for 5,000+ beneficiaries and utilize a variable msr for below 5,000 beneficiaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3\n basic level e track vs. enhanced track - we understand from your proposed rule that certain basic track acos may have a lower repayment mechanism amount to reflect the potentially lower levels of loss liability.  we also understand the glide path for taking risk concluding at a level of risk that meets the standard  to  qualify  as  advanced  alternative  payment  model  (apm)  under  macra. however, when comparing basic level e and the enhanced tracks, the levels of exposure to losses and repayment mechanisms are considerably unbalanced.  for example, an aco with an  estimated  historical  benchmark  of  12k  per  capita, which participates in the enhanced track with 10,000 beneficiaries would potentially receive 50% more of shared savings, but would  be  exposing  itself  to  losses  37.5  times  more,  with  a  much  greater  repayment mechanism.  to try to earn $24 million, this aco risks losing $18 million.  while in level e, the exposure is 4%.  the aco in level e would risk $480,000 to earn $12 million, with a much  lower  repayment  mechanism. the  table  below further  illustrates  a  straightforward analysis  regarding  the  impact  of  downsize  risk.  cms  should decrease the  downside  risk overall for the enhanced track if the desired outcome of the proposed rule is for acos to take risk. lower downside risk would certainly be more attractive to those not only wanting to  join  the  aco  movement  of  improving  healthcare  and  reducing  costs,  but  also  moving forward from the basic track to the enhanced model.  this is especially true for physician- owned entities.  basic level e track is designed appropriately, but the enhanced track is simply unbearable.  the proposed rule will decrease the likelihood of participation from low revenue acos.  since most of us in the rio grande valley are participating in the current track 3 model, we are accustomed with bearing risk.  unfortunately, due to the proposed rules, we are forced to rethink strategically and operationally, both of which cause financial burden.  fundamentally, we are having to reconsider participation in the enhanced track altogether due to the downside risk and extensive operational costs to be successful.  we urge cms to provide a softer downside risk that facilitates proper investment and enough cushion in the benchmark that allows for additional revenue to be created.\n basic track - level e  enhanced track beneficiaries  max savings max shared savings max loss payment repayment mechanism  beneficiaries  max savings max shared savings max loss payment repayment mechanism 10,000  24 mil  12 mil  *480k  120k  10,000  32 mil  24 mil  18 mil  1.2 mil 20,000  48 mil  24 mil  960k  240k  20,000  64 mil  48 mil  36 mil  2.4 mil 30,000  72 mil  36 mil  1.44 mil  360k  30,000  96 mil  72 mil  54 mil  3.6 mil * 4% revenue of an estimated historical benchmark of 12k\n\n aco repayment mechanism tail requirements - we recommend modifying the repayment mechanism tail to 12 months from the end of the last performance year.  12 months will meet the run-out time for final reconciliation and payment of any associated losses.\n\n\n 4\n this is not an issue of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaming\u00e2\u0080\u009d the system.  it is a prudent practice to have stop loss/re- insurance to address unexpected risk.  furthermore, it would support acos to participate in the  enhanced  track  because  the  downside  risk  would  not  be  unendurable.  acos  need additional methods to repay losses.\n - cms should allow acos taking risk to obtain and maintain insurance coverage to address losses.\n participation agreement periods - due to the significant revisions contained in the proposed rule, we agree with cms to cancel the 2018 application cycle.  however, we strongly urge cms to commence the pathway to success program as of january 1, 2020.  acos with agreements set to expire as of december 31,  2018, should be offered the opportunity to extend that agreement by renewing for a fourth  performance  full  year,  which  should  last  twelve  months  from  january  1,  2019 through december 31, 2019.  under the proposed rule, having two separate performance years, january 1 through june 30 under current mssp and then july 1 through december 31 under the new pathways to success, would be extremely burdening not only for cms but for acos  as  well.    managing  and  implementing  necessary  modifications  to  operational processes  for  two  different  sets  of  populations  to  meet  program  and  organization expectations in one year would be considerably taxing and overall challenging.  moreover, receiving separate reconciliation reports for the two performance periods only adds to the complexity of the program, including the deciphering of appropriate financial distributions, if applicable.\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements - snf  3  day  waiver  -  we  agree  with  the  proposal  to  expand  eligibility  for  the  snf  3-day waiver  rule  to  include  acos  participating  in  a  two-sided  model  under  preliminary prospective  assignment  with  retrospective  reconciliation.    additionally,  while  we understand that the quality of snf selection must be maintained, we suggest a re-evaluation of the indicators that qualify snfs to be included in the application acceptance criteria. in many areas of the country, including rural areas, snfs which successfully maintain a rating of 3 or more stars, as currently required, are limited.  this makes it difficult to utilize the waiver to its fullest potential. perhaps focusing on a particular category under the cms 5- star quality rating system as reported on the nursing home compare website instead of an overall  rating  or  including  other  ratings  and  qualifications  may  help  with  the  successful utilization of the waiver.\n - telehealth  -  we  agree  that  eligible  physicians  and  practitioners  in  acos  under performance-based  risk  and  prospective  assignment  can  receive  payment  for  telehealth services  furnished  to  prospectively  assigned  beneficiaries.    we  recommend  cms  include acos  participating  in  a  two-sided  model  under  preliminary  prospective  assignment with retrospective reconciliation as eligible for the telehealth waiver.  thus, aco eligibility will be the same for both the snf and telehealth waivers.  it will create consistency and be more streamlined for cms to manage.\n\n\n 5\n - funding from outside entities - we urge cms to reconsider their prohibition on accepting funds from outside sources to fund the beneficiary incentive program.  we fully appreciate the concerns raised about undue influence and its potential.  we think it is possible to set up appropriate boundaries and accounting mechanisms for any outside funds that they could be used judiciously.  if cms allows outside funds to be used, we expect the aco to have a public disclosure of the funding source(s).\n - additional waivers / beneficiary enhancements - having reliable transportation has been quite  challenging  for  our  population.    if  patients  cannot  visit  with  their  primary  care physicians due to lack of transportation, they aren't able to benefit from proper health care, care  coordination,  health  management,  etc.    we  request  that  cms  include  the  $20 beneficiary  enhancement  payment  for  transportation  costs,  not  only  for  a  qualifying primary care service.  for example, if a patient does not have the transportation needed to visit an aco clinic, can the aco clinic pay for a taxi or other to ensure the patient receives health  care?    assisting  patients  with  transportation  will  also  reduce  unnecessary hospitalizations in the long run.\n beneficiary opt-in based on assignment methodology medicare advantage plan \u00e2\u0080\u0093 leakage of beneficiaries - voluntary  alignment  -  this  is  a  good  idea.    however,  we  have  experienced  operational issues  and  our  patients  have  found  the  process  difficult.  is  there  way  to  simplify  the process?\n - opt-in enrollment process - although an opt-in enrollment is a valuable idea and utilized by health plans, many acos do not have the infrastructure or the staff necessary to effectively operate such a process.  we agree with medicare, as indicated in the proposed rule, there is no  connection  between  opt-in  enrollment  and  actual  utilization  of  primary  care  services. we agree this is not the answer to the beneficiary alignment issues of the program.\n benchmark cms-hcc risk scores - newly  and  continuously  assigned  beneficiary  distinction  -  we  agree with removing  this distinction.\n - 3% symmetrical cap - allowing for changes in the cms-hcc risk scores for the beneficiary population  is  a  significant  improvement.  it  will  partially  address  the  issue  of  the  aging population in the aco over the contract cycle.  with moving to a 5-year contract cycle, we recommend  consideration  of  an  asymmetrical  cap,  such  as  3%  downward  and  a  10% upward cap to be phased in over the 5-year contract cycle.  this will account for the aging of the population and natural progression of disease over the 5-year contract.  example: year 1 (3% down / 3% up); year 2 (3% down / 4% up); year 3 (3% down / 6% up); year 4 (3% down / 8% up); year 5 (3% down / 10% up).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6\n we appreciate the opportunity to submit these comments and sincerely hope they provide you with useful feedback as you finalize pathways to success.\n sincerely,\n\n\n rio grande valley acos:\n sheila m. magoon, md buena vida y salud, llc

8013\n\n baltimore, md 21244-8013\n re: medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations--pathways to success [cms-1701-p]\n dear administrator verma:\n\n i welcome the opportunity to comment on the centers for medicare and medicaid services\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 (cms)\n \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-- pathways to success\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 notice of proposed rulemaking. this letter comments on several different aspects of the proposed rule, primarily proposals to reconfigure participation options in the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and proposals to change the benchmark methodology.\n\n my main recommendations on each of these portions of the proposed rule are as follows:\n\n e curtailing one-sided participation options: the requirement that all acos quickly accept two-sided risk could improve the performance of acos that continue to participate in the mssp, but would also reduce mssp participation. cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal does not strike an obviously unreasonable balance between these competing considerations, but there is real uncertainty about the correct policy path. thus, if cms finalizes this proposal, cms should carefully monitor mssp participation and change course if participation falls precipitously.\n regardless, cms should correct its claim that participation in mssp via one-sided models has increased medicare spending to date, which contradicts the best evidence.\n\n e shifting to five-year agreement periods: shifting to five-year agreement periods would strengthen acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending by breaking the link between acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 performance in the first two years of each agreement period and their future benchmarks.\n cms should finalize this proposal. to align with this change, cms should begin using five-year spending averages rather than three-year spending averages when establishing\n acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 benchmarks. while this modification would worsen incentives during the first two years of each agreement period, it would improve them during the final three years of an agreement period. on average over the entirety of a five-year agreement period, this modification to cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal would likely improve incentives modestly.\n\n changing the method of measuring acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 total revenue: cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to measure acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 total part a and b revenue based solely acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 participant lists, rather than also counting revenue received by providers with an ownership or operational interest in one or more aco participants, could allow acos that are affiliated with a hospital to access participation options that are intended for physician-only acos. thus, if cms is going to vary the rules that apply to acos based on their total part a and b revenue, it should count revenue received by the broader set of providers.\n\n modifying the risk adjustment methodology: cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to rely solely on changes in cms-hcc risk scores for the purposes of risk adjustment during an agreement period has the potential to simplify and improve risk adjustment in mssp. however, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to limit benchmark adjustments to 3 percent in either direction is flawed. at a minimum, cms should eliminate the limit on downward benchmark adjustments in order to deter risk selection by acos. cms should also eliminate the limit on upward adjustments, which undermines risk adjustment\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s ability to protect acos from idiosyncratic deterioration in patient mix, and instead implement other policies that limit acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 ability to benefit from aggressive coding of patient diagnoses.\n\n capping and shrinking the regional adjustment to aco benchmarks: cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to reduce the size of the regional adjustment would likely increase participation in the mssp by acos with high spending relative to their regions, but would weaken participating acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending by strengthening the link between acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 current performance and their future benchmarks. the analysis cms uses to justify this proposal ignores the downsides of this policy change, so cms should conduct additional analysis that takes account of these negative effects and reconsider its proposal based on the outcome of that analysis. cms should also consider alternative changes to the benchmarking methodology that could encourage participation by historically high spending acos without undermining acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending.\n\n implementing a national-regional blend for calculating trend factors: rather than adopting benchmark trend factors based on blend of national and regional spending growth rates, cms should continue to use purely regional trend factors, but exclude an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries when computing the trend factors that apply to that aco. when an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s service area does not include enough enrollees not aligned with the aco to compute reliable trend factors, cms should include data from adjacent or otherwise similar counties. cms should also exclude an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries when computing the regional spending average used in computing the regional adjustment.\n\n using regional factors during an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period: cms should finalize its proposal to use regional trend factors when establishing and updating an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s\n benchmark during its first agreement period. cms should also finalize its proposal to apply\n 2\n a regional adjustment when establishing an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark for a first agreement period, but it should conduct additional analysis to determine the size of that adjustment.\n\n the remainder of this letter discusses my comments on each of these portions of the rule in greater detail. please note that the views expressed in this letter are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of officers, trustees, or other staff members of the brookings institution.\n\n curtailing one-sided mssp participation options (section it.a.3 of the nprm)\n\n the proposed rule would reconfigure providers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 options for participating in the mssp, replacing the existing mssp tracks 1, 2, and 3, as well as the center for medicare and medicaid innovation (cmmi) track 1+ model, with basic and enhanced tracks within the mssp. most consequentially, these changes would sharply curtail acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 ability to participate in the mssp under models that require only one-sided risk. currently, acos can participate under one-sided risk for up to six years via the track 1 model. under the proposed rule, acos could participate under one-sided risk for at most two years via the proposed basic track. after that two-year period, an aco would have to participate in a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3level\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 of the basic track that includes downside risk similar to that under the current track 1+ model, or in the enhanced track, which is essentially the same as the current track 3.\n\n requiring acos to bear two-sided risk has both advantages and disadvantages, and there is real uncertainty about how to weigh these competing considerations. there are two main benefits to consider. first, requiring two-sided risk strengthens acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending. under one-sided risk, reducing spending only generates financial rewards for the aco if the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s spending comes in at a level that makes the aco eligible for shared savings. but because spending outcomes have a significant random component even effective acos will sometimes be ineligible for shared savings. under two-sided risk, reducing spending can pay off for the aco even if the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s spending exceeds its benchmark by reducing the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s shared loss payments. second, acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 shared loss payments directly benefit the federal budget. both of these benefits are plausibly significant, although the importance of the first is hard to quantify with existing evidence.\n\n on the other hand, requiring acos to bear downside risk will cause some acos that would have participated in the mssp under one-sided risk to leave the program. acos that currently have spending above the average in their region would be particularly likely to depart because aco benchmarks are based in part on regional average spending; for these acos, the expected cost of making shared loss payments would tend to exceed the expected benefit of receiving shared savings payments. other acos might lack the capital required to make a significant shared loss payment and thus decline to participate, even if they thought they were much more likely to receive a shared savings payment than to be required to make a shared loss payment.\n\n at various points in the proposed rule, cms suggests that losing acos that currently participate in mssp via track 1 would not be cause for concern. in particular, cms cites an analysis that compares track 1 acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 actual spending to their benchmarks to argue that track 1 acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096\n participation in mssp actually increased federal spending on net in 2016. if that were the case, then losing these providers from the mssp might indeed be a benign outcome.!\n however, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 analysis is misleading. as other analysts have emphasized, acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 benchmarks are set based on policy considerations and do not measure what acos would have spent in the absence of the mssp, so they cannot be used to gauge the causal effect of the mssp on medicare spending.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 consistent with this, research that compares acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 spending to true counterfactuals found that the mssp reduced federal spending in 2015, despite the fact that the vast majority of mssp acos in 2015 were participating through track 1.* that research found that aco performance was either stable or improving over time, so it is plausible that a similar analysis for 2016 would find similar or better results. simply comparing acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 actual spending to their benchmarks also does not capture \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3spillover\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 effects acos may have on beneficiaries that are not assigned to the aco; notably, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 own regulatory impact analysis concludes that these spillover effects have been substantial, and, on this basis, concludes that the mssp generated large net savings for the medicare program in 2016. thus, the best evidence implies that losing a significant number of acos that currently participate in the mssp via track 1 would have real costs\n it is uncertain how much eliminating track 1 would reduce participation in the mssp. track 1 currently accounts for more than three-quarters of aligned beneficiaries associated with acos participating in the mssp or track 1+. it is doubtful that all of these acos would leave the program if required to take on two-sided risk. some would ultimately have transitioned to two- sided risk on their own as they gained experience with mssp and gained greater familiarity with the bonus payments available under the quality payment program. additionally, if two-sided risk became a required feature of mssp participation, new structures to help providers bear that risk would likely emerge. for example, acos commonly participate in the mssp in collaboration with a third-party service provider; these service providers may be able to bear a portion of this risk on acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 behalf if necessary. nevertheless, as cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 regulatory impact analysis recognizes, requiring two-sided risk will likely cause some meaningful reduction in mssp participation.\n\n given the paucity of evidence on how acos would behave under different policy regimes, it is hard to definitively weigh the benefits of improved incentives for mssp participants against the costs in the form of reduced mssp participation. cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposals not do strike on obviously unreasonable balance between these competing considerations, but in light of the uncertainty, there is areal risk that this policy will not operate as intended. thus, cms should carefully monitor how the policy affects participation in mssp and swiftly modify the policy if participation falls sharply.\n\n summary of recommendations: cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposals to require providers to take on two-sided risk do not strike an obviously unreasonable balance among competing objectives, but there is real uncertainty about the appropriate policy path. cms should carefully monitor how this policy\n\n\n ' even if cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 analysis were correct, reductions in participation might still be cause for concern. the mssp has objectives other than reducing federal spending, like improving the quality of care. additionally, even if track 1 acos cost the federal government money in the aggregate, if some track 1 acos did generate savings for the federal government, then it still would be preferable to keep those acos in the program.\n\n ? chernew, michael e., christopher barbery, and j. michael mcwilliams. 2017. \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3savings reported by cms do not measure true aco

in mssp and change course if necessary. cms should correct its claim that participation in mssp via one-sided models has increased medicare spending to date.\n\n shifting to five-year agreement periods (section ii.a.2 of the nprm)\n\n the proposed rule would lengthen aco agreement periods to five years, up from three years under current regulations. this proposal would likely strengthen acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending.\n as discussed in detail later in this comment letter, the benchmark rebasing that occurs at the start of each new agreement period can undermine acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending because rebased benchmarks are based in part on acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 own recent spending. as a result, acos that reduce spending today are \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3penalized\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 with lower benchmarks in the future.\n\n shifting to five-year agreement periods eliminates this problem for the first two years of each agreement period because rebasing calculations only use the most recent three years of spending data. for this reason, the proposal would be an improvement over the status quo. however, if the shift to five-year agreement periods is finalized, cms should consider changing rebasing calculations to use five-year spending averages rather than the three-year spending averages currently used. this would reintroduce the incentive problem described above during the first two years of an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s agreement period, but ameliorate the problem during the final three years of an agreement period. on average over the entirety of a five-year agreement period, this modification to cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal would likely improve incentives modestly.\n\n summary of recommendations: cms should finalize its proposal to lengthen aco agreement periods to five years. to align with this change, cms should begin using five-year spending averages rather than three-year spending averages in rebasing calculations.\n\n changing the method of measuring an acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 total revenue (section ii.a.3 and section ii.a.5 of the nprm)\n\n cms proposes to vary its treatment of acos based on their total revenue under medicare parts a and b. acos whose total part a and b revenue is less than 25 percent of total spending by their assigned beneficiaries would be allowed to participate in the basic track for a longer period.\n additionally, shared losses paid by acos participating in the basic track would be limited to no more than 8 percent of total part a and b revenue. cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 objective in configuring the program in this way is to provide more lenient terms to acos that do not include a hospital.\n\n cms proposes to define an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s total part a and b revenue as the total part a and b revenue received by the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participants. this definition departs significantly from the definition used in the track 1+ model, under which cms also counted part a and b revenue received by providers with an ownership or operational interest in one or more aco participants.\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach has a serious shortcoming. failing to count revenue earned by entities with an ownership relationship to aco participants would allow many acos that are affiliated with a hospital to access participation options that are intended for physician-only acos.\n consider, for example, an aco that consists of a hospital and a set of hospital-owned physician practices. under cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach, the aco could list the physician practices as aco\n 5\n participants, but not list the hospital. this would greatly reduce the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s measured part a and b revenue, allowing it to participate in the mssp while bearing much less financial risk.\n\n citing experience under track 1+, cms argues that counting revenue earned by entities with an ownership or operational interest in aco participants would not appreciably change an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s measured part a and b revenue in most cases. but the track 1+ evidence cannot speak to the key policy question. precisely because track 1+ counts revenue earned by providers with an ownership or operational interest in an aco participant, there was no incentive to strategically exclude these providers from an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participant list. experience under track 1+ is therefore uninformative regarding the potential importance of this type of strategic behavior.\n\n summary of recommendations: if cms is going to vary the rules that apply to acos based on their total part a and b revenue, it should count revenue received by entities that have ownership and operational interests in aco participants, not just revenue received by providers on an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participant list.\n\n modifying the risk adjustment methodology used during an agreement period (section ii.d.2 of the nprm)\n\n cms currently uses a relatively complex method to adjust an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark for changes in the risk profile of its beneficiaries since the start of an agreement period. for newly aligned beneficiaries, cms uses cms-hcc risk scores to adjust for changes in risk mix. for beneficiaries continuously aligned with an aco since the start of an agreement period, cms adjusts their contribution to the benchmark for demographic changes and makes a downward adjustment if these beneficiaries\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 risk scores decline, but makes no corresponding adjustment if risk scores rise.\n the proposed rule would eliminate the distinction between continuously and newly aligned beneficiaries and instead adjust an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark based on the full change in the average cms-hcc risk score of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s beneficiaries, except that the total adjustment to the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark would be limited to a maximum of 3 percent in either direction.\n\n the revised methodology has two virtues; it is simpler than the old methodology, and it better protects acos against deteriorations in their patient mix. however, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to cap risk- score-based adjustments at 3 percent in either direction is problematic. most importantly, the limit on downward adjustments will encourage acos to avoid sicker enrollees and seek out healthier enrollees since, once an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s risk score has declined by at least 3 percent, risk adjustment will no longer offset the benefits of risk selection to the aco. at a minimum, therefore, cms should eliminate the cap on downward adjustments in acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 risk scores.\n\n on the other end of the spectrum, capping upward adjustments limits risk adjustment\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s ability to compensate acos for random changes in their patient mix. this reduces the predictability of acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 financial performance and thereby makes mssp participation less attractive. cms is correct to worry that allowing unlimited upward adjustments could allow acos to profitably increase coding intensity. however, strong incentives to increase coding intensity already exist since cms already fully incorporates an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s risk score when setting an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark at the start of an agreement period. moreover, there are better ways of addressing coding concerns.\n in particular, cms could implement a coding intensity adjustment like the one used in medicare\n advantage, create audit mechanisms to detect inappropriate coding, and introduce harsher penalties for acos found to have engaged in inappropriate coding.\n\n summary of recommendations: cms should finalize its proposals to update benchmarks based on changes in cms-hcc risk scores. however, cms should not finalize the proposed cap on risk- score-based adjustments. at a minimum, cms should eliminate the cap on downward adjustments in order to deter risk selection by acos. cms should also eliminate the cap on upward adjustments and implement other policies aimed at limiting acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 ability to benefit from aggressive coding.\n\n capping and shrinking the regional adjustment to aco benchmarks (section ii.d.3.c of the nprm)\n\n to establish an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark for its second and subsequent agreement periods, cms undertakes a two-step process: (1) cms computes average spending by the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s beneficiaries during the three years immediately preceding the agreement period; and (2) it adds a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3regional adjustment\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 equal to percentage of the difference between regional average spending and the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own historical spending. the percentage used in computing the regional adjustment depends on how long the aco has been participating in the program and how the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s spending compares to average spending in its region. under this approach, each aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark is effectively a weighted average of spending by the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s assigned beneficiaries and average spending in the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s region during the years before each agreement period.\n\n cms proposes to reduce the size of the regional adjustment in two ways. first and likely most importantly, cms proposes to limit the total size of the regional adjustment to 5 percent of national average fee-for-service spending. second, cms proposes to make the underlying regional adjustment a smaller percentage of the difference between regional average spending and the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own historical spending in the long run, reducing the relevant percentage from 70 percent to 50 percent. (cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal would have more complicated effects in the short and medium run.\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to apply a regional adjustment for acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 first agreement period, discussed in greater detail below, would increase the weight placed on regional spending in some cases.)\n\n evaluating these proposed changes is challenging because determining the appropriate size of the regional adjustment requires trading off various competing considerations. on the positive side, a larger regional adjustment strengthens participating acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to make care more efficient.\n this is because the regional adjustment weakens the link between an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s future benchmarks and its own past spending, which reduces the extent to which lowering spending today reduces the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s future benchmarks. additionally, the regional adjustment increases the expected reward to attracting an additional beneficiary for low-spending acos and reduces it for high-spending acos, which may encourage more efficient providers to expand their market share, while discouraging less efficient providers from doing so.\n\n on the other hand, it is also important to consider how the regional adjustment affects incentives for mssp participation by different types of acos, as well as the attendant implications for medicare spending. a modest regional adjustment can actually improve participation incentives because it accounts for the tendency of acos that were low-spending in prior periods to experience somewhat faster growth in subsequent years (and vice versa), a phenomenon known as\n \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3mean reversion.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5* due to mean reversion, basing benchmarks solely on an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own recent spending will tend to give historically high-spending acos benchmarks that are higher than needed to get them to participate in the program, providing them with an unnecessary windfall at, while giving historically low-spending acos benchmarks that may be too low to get them to participate, forfeiting the opportunity to improve the efficiency of those providers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 care.\n\n however, a regional adjustment that goes beyond what is needed to account for mean revision\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 which the existing adjustment almost certainly does\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6creates the opposite problem. a large regional adjustment makes mssp participation less attractive for historically high-spending acos, potentially forfeiting the opportunity to improve the performance of those relatively inefficient providers. at the same time, a regional adjustment beyond what is needed to account for mean reversion will provide windfall benefits to historically low-spending acos.\u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u0096\u0091\n it is possible that cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach strikes a better balance among these competing considerations than the current approach. however, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 analysis provides little reason to be confident that this is the case. cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 qualitative discussion of the proposed changes essentially ignores the concern that reducing the size of the regional adjustment could weaken participating aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s incentive to reduce spending or discourage expansion by low-spending acos. similarly, the regulatory impact analysis, which is the main evidence cms provides in favor of making this change, appears to assume that reducing the size of the regional adjustment would have no effect on performance by participating acos. this assumption is implausible and is likely to lead cms to understate the appropriate size of the regional adjustment. cms should remedy these flaws in its analysis and, if merited, modify its proposals accordingly.\n\n it is feasible to modify cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 analysis to account for how the regional adjustment affects acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 marginal incentives to reduce spending. specifically, cms could estimate how the present value of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s expected shared savings (or shared losses) change when the aco reduces spending by a dollar\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6incorporating both the contemporaneous increase in shared savings (or reduction in shared losses) and the reduction in future shared savings (or increase in shared losses) due to lower benchmarks\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6and examine how this marginal return varies across benchmarking methodologies.\n these marginal returns could be estimated under varying assumptions about how much acos discount future cash flows. cms could then adjust the amount acos are expected to reduce spending under different policy scenarios based on the differences in this marginal return across benchmarking methodologies. a reasonable baseline assumption is that the amount acos will reduce spending is roughly proportional to the expected marginal return to reducing spending, but cms should examine alternative assumptions as well.\n\n economic theory and the available evidence provide less guidance on how to account for the possibility that the regional adjustment might promote expansion by more efficient acos.\n however, this is not a justification for simply assuming that these effects do not exist. in light of\n\n\n 4 this phenomenon reflects that fact that high spending in any particular period typically reflects a combination of persistent factors, like inefficient care patterns and patient population differences, and transient \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3bad luck,\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 like an idiosyncratic expensive case.\n\n 5 selective participation is mitigated to some degree by the bonus for participation in advanced alternative payment models under the quality payment program, but that bonus would have to be much larger to eliminate these concerns entirely.\n\n the substantial uncertainty, cms could conduct analyses under a range of assumptions about how changes in an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s expected shared savings affect its market share.\n\n stepping beyond the current proposal, cms should consider alternative modifications to the benchmarking methodology that could ameliorate the main downsides of the existing regional adjustment (specifically, reduced participation by high-spending acos) without undermining acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending. namely, cms could construct all or part of an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark by trending forward the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark from its first agreement period using some growth rate unrelated to the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own performance; michael mcwilliams, michael chernew, and bruce landon propose this approach in their comment letter on this proposed rule.\u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u0096\u0091 like the regional adjustment, this approach would break the link between an acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 current performance and its future benchmarks, thereby ensuring acos have strong incentives to reduce spending.\n however, it would offer higher benchmarks to historically high spending acos than the existing regional adjustment methodology, thereby encouraging those acos to participate in the mssp, while limiting windfalls to historically low spending acos.\n\n an ideal approach would likely combine the existing benchmarking approach with the approach proposed by mcwilliams, chernew, and landon. specifically, a portion of an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark would be set by trending forward the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark from is first agreement period, and a portion would be set based on average spending in the acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 region. the weight placed on regional average spending would be based on: (1) the amount the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s spending is expected to have reverted toward the mean since the benchmark period associated with the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period; (2) the extent to which historically high-spending acos are expected to be more successful in reducing spending than low-spending acos; and (3) an additional amount to encourage historically low-spending acos to expand to serve additional patients. because the expected amount of mean reversion is likely to rise over time, the appropriate weight on the regional average component would likely rise over time as well. if desired, some weight could also be placed on a traditional rebased benchmark in the long run. the appropriate weight on the traditional rebased benchmark would depend on the appropriate balance between ensuring strong incentives at the margin and ensuring broad participation by acos at different spending levels.\n\n cms considered approaches similar to those proposed by mcwilliams, chernew, and landon in the rulemaking establishing the current benchmarking methodology, but rejected them.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 cms expressed concern about locking in historical spending differences for the indefinite future, as well as concerns regarding how to adjust for changes in aco composition over time. the latter concern can be addressed by rebalancing the weight between the trended component of the benchmark and the regional average component of the benchmark over time, as suggested above. additionally, the comment letter by mcwilliams, chernew, and landon describes methods for addressing changes in aco composition that should be sufficient to largely address these concerns.\n\n summary of recommendations: cms should redo its analysis of these proposed changes to account for main downsides of curtailing the regional adjustment, notably weakening incentives for acos to reduce spending and discouraging efficient acos from expanding. based on the\n\n\n 6 the comment by mcwilliams, chernew, and landon is available at https://hmrlab.hcp.med.harvard.edu/files/hmrtest2/files/comment_on_mssp_proposed_rule_cms-1701-p_- _mewilliams_chernew_landon_01.pdf.\n\n 781 cfr 38011\n results from that improved analysis, cms should reconsider whether its proposed changes appropriately balance the competing objectives of the regional adjustment. cms should also consider alternative changes to the benchmarking methodology that could encourage participation by historically high-spending acos without undermining incentives to reduce spending.\n\n implementing a national-regional blend for calculating trend factors (section ii.d.3.d of the nprm)\n\n cms generally uses regional spending growth rates to derive the trend factors used in two parts of the benchmarking calculations: combining data from the three years of the benchmark period and trending the benchmark forward to each performance period.* regional trend factors have important advantages relative to the national trend factors cms has used in the past since they account for region-specific changes in practice patterns, socioeconomic factors, and other variables that may influence an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s spending performance. this reduces the amount of \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3noise\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 in acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 measured performance, which may make mssp participation more attractive. it also makes mssp participation more attractive to acos in regions where spending growth is expected to exceed national spending growth, while curtailing windfalls to acos in regions where spending growth is expected to be slower than national spending growth.\n\n however, as cms notes in the proposed rule, in instances where an aco accounts for a large fraction of all medicare beneficiaries in its region, an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own performance can have an excessive influence on the regional trend factors. this fact can, in turn, substantially weaken an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s incentive to reduce spending because an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s success in reducing spending translates into a lower regional trend factor and, thus, a lower benchmark, thereby keeping the aco from getting full credit for the savings it achieved. for example, for an aco that accounted for 40 percent of the beneficiaries in its region, reducing spending by a dollar will reduce the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark by around 40 cents, so the aco will only receive credit for 60 cents of savings. cms proposes to address this problem by using trend factors based on a blend of national and regional growth rates, with the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s weighted average penetration in its service area determining the weight placed on the national growth rates.\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach would likely be an improvement over current practice, but cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach nevertheless has two key flaws. first, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach only partially solves the problem at hand. consider once again an aco that accounts for 40 percent of the beneficiaries in its region. under cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal, national growth rates will receive a weight of only 40 percent in computing the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s trend factor, so the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own performance will still determine around 24 percent (=0.6 x 0.4) of the blended trend factor. as a result, if the aco reduces spending by a dollar, its benchmark will fall by around 24 cents, and it will receive credit for only around 76 cents of savings. thus, while cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach is an improvement relative to using the existing regional trend factors, much of the incentive problem remains.\n second, placing significant weight on national growth rates would result in a trend factor that does a worse job capturing the local spending trends facing an aco. indeed, as noted above, the original reason for adopting regional trend factors was to better capture these local trends.\n\n\n\n 8 the exception is an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period, when cms currently uses national trend factors. however, as discussed below, cms is proposing to switch to regional trend factors in this rule.\n\n 10\n in light of these shortcomings, a better approach would be to exclude each aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries when computing regional trend factors. this approach would entirely eliminate the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s influence on its own trend factor. this approach would also completely (or almost completely) preserve the benefits of using regional trend factors in benchmarking calculations.\n\n the proposed rule cites three reasons for rejecting this alternative approach, but each of cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 concerns is either readily addressed or misplaced. first, cms argues that the number of enrollees in an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s service area that are not affiliated with the aco may sometimes be too small to estimate a reliable trend factor; however, this problem can be easily addressed by incorporating information from adjacent or similar counties when population sizes are too small. second, cms argues that beneficiaries not affiliated with the aco may differ from those who are affiliated with the aco; however, this problem affects virtually any conceivable trend methodology, including cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed national-regional blend, so it does not provide a basis for rejecting this methodology in particular. third, cms argues that acos may try to attract healthier enrollees and drive away sicker enrollees in order to manipulate the trend factor; however, these types of risk selection incentives are inherent in the aco program and, as in other settings, the best policy response is to operate an effective risk adjustment program.\n\n as a final note, while cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal focuses on how an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s performance affects the trend factors used during an agreement period, an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own performance also affects the regional spending average used to compute the regional adjustment to its benchmark for future agreement periods. including the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries in the regional average used to compute the regional adjustment undermines one of the main objectives of the regional adjustment, which is to (partially) break the link between the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s current performance and its future benchmarks. for this reason, cms should also exclude an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries from the regional spending average used to compute the regional adjustment at the start of an agreement period.\n\n summary of recommendations: rather than adopting trend factors based on a national-regional blend, cms should continue to use purely regional trend factors, but exclude an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries when computing those trend factors. in cases where an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s service area does not include enough enrollees not aligned with the aco to compute reliable trend factors, cms should include data from adjacent or otherwise similar counties. cms should also exclude an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries when computing the regional spending average used to compute the regional adjustment to an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark at the start of an agreement period.\n\n using regional factors during an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period (section ii.d.3.b of the nprm)\n\n as described above, after an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period, cms uses regional trend factors to combine data from the benchmark years and to update the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark during an agreement period, and cms implements a regional adjustment when establishing an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark. in contrast, cms currently uses national trend factors and does not make a regional adjustment in benchmark calculations for an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period. in this proposed rule, cms proposes to begin using regional trend factors and making a regional adjustment in benchmark calculations for an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period.\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to adopt regional trend factors during an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement periods is a good\none. the advantages of using regional trend factors discussed above apply just as strongly to first\n agreement periods as to subsequent agreement periods. using the same trend factors across all agreement periods will also simplify the benchmarking methodology, as cms notes.\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to implement a regional adjustment during an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period also has merit, but cms should do additional analysis to determine the appropriate size of the adjustment. the rationale for implementing a regional adjustment is markedly different in an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period than in later agreement periods. in particular, as discussed above, the most important rationale for a regional adjustment in later agreement periods is to reduce the link between an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s current performance and its future benchmarks, thereby strengthening the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s incentive to reduce spending. that rationale is not relevant to an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period (unless the behavior of non-aco providers is shaped by the possibility that they might choose to join an aco in the future, which is likely not a significant issue in practice).\n\n rather, the most important rationale for a regional adjustment in an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period is to account for mean reversion, the tendency of high-spending acos to experience below- average spending growth and low-spending acos to experience above-average spending growth in subsequent years. the appropriate weight to place on the regional adjustment in an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s initial agreement period thus should reflect the amount of mean reversion actually experienced by acos, plus possibly a modest additional amount to reflect the potential benefits of encouraging relatively low-spending acos to expand their market shares. cms should do an analysis to estimate the amount of mean reversion in acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 spending and set the weight placed on the regional adjustment in a first agreement period accordingly.\n\n summary of recommendations: cms should finalize its proposal to use regional trend factors when establishing and updating an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark during its first agreement period. cms should also finalize its proposal to apply a regional adjustment when establishing an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark for a first agreement period, but it should conduct additional analysis to determine the appropriate size of that regional adjustment.\n\n thank you for the opportunity to comment on cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed rule.

administrator verma:\n the  american  psychiatric  association,  the  national medical  society  representing  more than 37,800 psychiatric physicians, appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  proposed  rule, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedicare  program;  medicare  shared  savings  program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  specifically, the apa would like to provide cms with information regarding telepsychiatry research and clinical practice in  response  to  the  elements of  the  proposed  rule  regarding  the  expansion  of reimbursement for telehealth services within medicare acos.\n overall, the apa is supportive of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand telehealth reimbursement by waiving certain geographic and originating site restrictions, allowing patients to be seen in their homes by psychiatrists practicing at a distance, regardless of whether they reside in a health professional shortage area (hpsa).  these two restrictions have historically been barriers to access to quality psychiatric care for medicare beneficiaries, resulting in the limited  use  of  much-needed  mental  health  services.    telepsychiatry  has  seen  a significant  uptick  in  use  among  clinicians  over  the  past  decade  and  an  ever-growing evidence base suggests that treatment via telepsychiatry demonstrates similar outcomes to  in-person  care  and,  in  some  cases,  better  outcomes\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially  with  certain populations, cultural groups, or clinical diagnoses.1,2\n telepsychiatry can also help to mitigate the stigma around seeking treatment for mental health conditions (in rural and urban locations alike) and can also be used to address the geographic  and  numeric  maldistribution  of  psychiatrists  across  the  united  states. eliminating the originating site and geographic requirements not only benefits patients with limited access to a psychiatrist in rural communities, but also for those who reside in  urban  areas  whose  physical or  psychiatric  diagnoses make  it  difficult  to  leave  their homes to visit the doctor.\n\n\n\n while the cost associated with expanding telehealth reimbursement in medicare has been a concern of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for some time, the apa would like to highlight that the cost of untreated mental illnesses, including substance abuse, should also be factored into the bigger picture of providing better access to mental healthcare to beneficiaries.  the current disease burden of mental illnesses and substance use disorders in the united states is very high, with 44.7 million adults experiencing a mental illness at any given time,\n20.1 million with a substance use disorder, and 3.4 million with comorbid mental illness/substance use \n disorder diagnoses.  the economic impact of these illnesses left untreated is also very high, with about\n$38.5 billion in emergency room care,3 $132.6 - $351 billion in those who have medical comorbidities with \n mental  illness,4 and  $193.2  billion  in  lost  productivity.5  improving  access  to  mental  health  services through telepsychiatry, which is proven to be as effective as in-person care, has the potential to alleviate the cost of untreated mental illness. the apa appreciates the opportunity to provide these comments to cms.  for more information about apa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work around telepsychiatry, please visit http://www.psychiatry.org/teletoolkit.  if you should have any questions or

\u00e2\u0080\u0094 pathways to success, proposed rule dear administrator verma: mayo clinic respectfully provides comments to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) on its proposed rule cms-1701-p medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pathways to success. mayo clinic is a not-for-profit physician led and physician driven health care system dedicated to medical care, research and education. with over 8,000 eligible clinicians (ec), 20 hospitals and 60,000 employees, mayo clinic demonstrates a 150 year commitment to excellence which has spawned a rich history of health care innovation. each year, more than one million people from all 50 states and 140 countries come to mayo clinic to receive the highest quality care at sites in minnesota, arizona and florida. in addition, mayo clinic health system, a family of clinics, hospitals and health care facilities, serves communities in iowa, minnesota and wisconsin. we respectfully submit the following comments to this proposed rule. over the past several years, we have undertaken an effort to begin to transition the mayo clinic from fee-for-service to pay-for-performance, and ultimately alternative payment model participation. this journey has involved careful planning and decision-making, charting a course toward greater levels of risk over time. the organization has successfully participated in the merit-based incentive payment system (mips) within the quality payment program as a result of careful planning and implementation of that program and we recently began participation in the bundled payments for care initiative advanced (bpci-a) program. we recognize that fee-for-service is time-limited which necessitates a move to alternative payment models across all payer types, including traditional medicare. with that ultimate goal in mind, we are carefully evaluating and considering our participation in the medicare shared savings program (mssp) accountable care organization (aco) program. based on our review of this program, we ask that you prioritize three important changes to the proposed rule:\ni. adjust the beneficiary attribution methodology to ensure that the appropriate patients are assigned \n to the aco.\nii. increase the shared savings percentages for mssp participants in the basic track across all 5 years. \n\niii. implement a fair risk adjustment methodology that accurately accounts for changes in the \n organizations such as mayo clinic are comfortable assuming risk if attributed populations represent those patients for whom they are truly accountable and if patient hcc scores are accurately tabulated and calculated for risk scoring by cms based on information both internal and external to the aco. we believe that with some modification, the mssp program, as proposed, could provide an important on-ramp and glide path for organizations like ours to move into downside risk arrangements over time. our detailed comments are provided below.\ni. \u0000 beneficiary attribution methodology \n mayo clinic supports aco choice in medicare beneficiary attribution methods to include both prospective and retrospective methods. however, we suggest that cms align its processes on beneficiary attribution to those in other programs making certain that organizations have a seamless approach to aco participation. for instance, the 2019 medicare physician fee schedule proposed rule includes language that will enable physicians and advance practice providers (nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and physician assistants) to soon receive credit for the evaluation and management services provided to patients under the same multispecialty organization. mayo clinic requests that cms adopt mssp-aco attribution processes similar to those proposed through the calendar year 2019 medicare physician fee schedule (mpfs) proposed rule allowing distinction on primary care advance practice provider (app) vs. specialty app. in prior years cms would deny multiple claims by advanced practice providers (apps), under the same organizational national provider identifier (npi) and tax identification number (tin), even if that practitioner was working in a different specialty. this created situations where claims were not tabulated by carriers for services provided in integrated settings. under the proposed rule for mpfs, these providers will now have claims processed by the carriers and carriers will recognize the primary care and specialty practice of the app. carriers have already begun to provide direction to providers and institutions on how to soon identify the specialty of the app since the medicare provider enrollment process has never accounted for the true app specialty practice unlike physicians. the benefit will be a reduction in claims-based attribution skewing occurring for integrated organizations. patients will be linked to their primary care app providing the plurality of evaluation and management services vs. the specialist. primary care providers are more than willing to accept responsibility for their attributed patients as long as the provider is truly the one responsible for overarching coordination of care and referral to specialists. mayo clinic also recommends that cms allow acos to submit individual provider npis for attribution purposes as opposed to utilizing all providers under the aco tin. not every aco provider under the tin is a primary care provider for patients or a provider seeing a population-based panel. we also encourage cms to explore other options for medicare beneficiary attribution assessment similar to those adopted by state agencies that often use an approach that includes exclusion, attribution, and tie-breaking steps to support a valid beneficiary population. the process includes an analysis of external claims, internal claims, and e/m claims by primary care and specialty providers within an organization. exclusion criteria are also used for those beneficiaries who do not have an historical relationship with the organization and where a utilization pattern of services cannot be clearly established for the patient. mayo clinic also noted that the proposed designated primary care-related services (evaluation and management services) for beneficiary attribution purposes does not include the initial preventive physical examination (ippe) or annual wellness visit (awv) to the list of applicable services. mayo clinic highly encourages cms to add these two services to the list as these services are most often provided by the primary healthcare provider for the medicare beneficiary and they are significant to accurate attribution.\n11. \u0000 shared sayings \n uncommon to take longer than 2 participation years to implement meaningful changes in its healthcare delivery model and provider and patient populations. requiring acos to transition to higher risk sharing models beginning with basic track level c could have unintended consequences negating the original intent of cms quality payment programs. mayo clinic encourages cms to increase shared savings in its basic track levels a and b to 50 percent, at a minimum, for inexperienced new entrants given significant infrastructure investments a new aco has to make in the early years; levels c and d to 55 percent; and level e to 60 percent with a goal of 75 percent shared savings by enhanced track achievement.\niii. \u0000 risk adjustment methodology \n\n", "0208": "see attached

electronically via https://www.regulations.gov/comment?d=cms-2018-0101-0001\n re: medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations- pathways to success [cms-1701-p]\n dear administrator verma,\n this letter serves to provide comments on the centers for medicare & medicaid services proposed rule that would redesign the medicare shared savings program, encouraging organizations to transition to two-sided risk models. the rio grande valley health alliance, llc (rgvha) has embraced the migration to risk and currently participates in track 3 with our current contract set to expire december 31, 2018.\n overall, we support the redesign of the medicare shared savings program and congratulate you and cms for setting the path towards achieving a more measurable move to value, demonstrating savings to the medicare program, and promoting a competitive and accountable marketplace.\n while we recognize the need for transformation and change, we urge you to consider the potentially negative effects this proposed rule will have on our organization and others.  as an early adopter of the aco model, our small primary care led aco, has saved over 43 million and maintained an average quality score of 97%.  the physicians in our organization strive for accountability in cost and quality and foster an organization of transparency.\n our success has been a journey of learning and adapting; it has taken time, effort, and buy-in to foster the culture of accountable medicine.  we believe any transformation should be completed with care, dignity, and respect for both current acos and prospective acos.\n it is of the upmost importance to note, had some of the proposals existed in 2013, we most certainly would not have had the resources or capability to grow towards the risk bearing, successful organization we are today.  based on our six-year experience as a medicare shared savings program aco, we respectfully recommend/support the following:\n ins, this option allows greater ability to manage the population truly receiving care by our primary care physicians and will ensure our panel remains above the 5,000 thresholds.\n monitoring financial performance in the proposal, cms is recommending proceeding with early termination for any aco that has a negative performance outside the corridor for 2 performance years.  this is unreasonable. acos should have an opportunity to establish a corrective action plan.  additionally, due to the timing of receipt of final reconciliation, an aco will not have enough time to make and implement adjustments.  it is important for an aco to have the final reconciliation information to make decisions, because final benchmarks can increase or decrease (which is not always predicable).  for example: the aco receives its year 1 final performance reports in august of year 2 and finds out their losses are outside the corridor.  the aco may have insufficient time to affect year 2 performance.  it will be able to initiate a corrective action plan for the remainder of year 2 and for the full year 3.  if it has losses outside the corridor in year 2, the aco will receive this final information in august of year 3.  the full accounting of the results of the corrective action plan will be assessed in august of year 4.  also, quarterly data should not be used for the determination of financial performance due to the natural seasonal variations in health care spending and utilization.  due to the natural time frame to implement and assess corrective actions, we recommend non-renewal of the next contract cycle rather than early termination.\n aco repayment mechanism for acos in two-sided model termination voluntary early termination - if the aco voluntarily terminates from the mssp program, the aco should be held responsible for a prorated repayment based on the date of termination.\n involuntary termination (terminated by cms) -if cms terminates an aco, the aco should not be held responsible for any losses.  the aco was willing to continue to participate and meet obligations, but cms chose to terminate. therefore, it should be cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responsibility to address the loss.\n participation tracks election of msr/mlr by acos we agree with the proposal to offer acos in a two-sided model the option to choose msr/mlr.\n we suggest the basic track one-sided model have the msr modified to a fixed 2% msr for 5,000+ beneficiaries and utilize a variable msr for below 5,000 beneficiaries.\n basic level e track vs. enhanced track rgvha supports the decision to redesign the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation options by offering two eligible tracks. however, we are opposed to the unbalanced level of risk required when comparing basic level e and enhanced track. basic level e track is designed appropriately, but the enhanced track is simply unbearable.\n certainly be more attractive to those not only wanting to join the aco movement of improving healthcare and reducing costs, but also moving forward from the basic track to the enhanced model.\n this is especially true for physician-owned entities.  physician led acos have historically shown the greatest success in the program, but the current loss potential would be crippling to an organization such as ours.\n we have participated in the track 3 model and are accustomed with bearing risk. we share yours and cms opinion that all acos should eventually assume risk.  unfortunately, due to the proposed rules, we are forced to rethink strategically and operationally, both of which cause financial burden.  we urge cms to provide a softer downside risk that facilitates proper investment and enough cushion in the benchmark that allows for additional revenue to be created.\n please see table below with hypothetical examples of the disparity in risk between basic track level e and enhanced track\n basic track - level e enhanced track beneficiaries

run-out time for final reconciliation and payment of any associated losses.\n re-insurance this is an established health care industry standard to address downside risk.  re-insurance should be an acceptable option for paying back losses associated with taking risk.  it is common practice for health insurance plans and should be an acceptable method for acos.\n this is not an issue of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaming\u00e2\u0080\u009d the system.  it is a prudent practice to have stop loss/re- insurance to address unexpected risk.  furthermore, it would support acos to participate in the enhanced track because the downside risk would not be unendurable.  acos need additional methods to repay losses.\n cms should allow acos taking risk to obtain and maintain insurance coverage to address losses.\n participation agreement periods due to the significant revisions contained in the proposed rule, we agree with cms to cancel the 2018 application cycle.  however, we strongly urge cms to commence the pathway to success program as of january 1, 2020.  acos with agreements set to expire as of december 31, 2018, should be offered the opportunity to extend that agreement by renewing for a fourth performance full year, which should last twelve months from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019. under the proposed rule, having two separate performance years, january 1 through june 30 under current mssp and then july 1 through december 31 under the new pathways to success, would be extremely burdening not only for cms but for acos as well.  managing and implementing necessary modifications to operational processes for two different sets of populations to meet program and organization expectations in one year would be considerably taxing and overall challenging.  moreover, receiving separate reconciliation reports for the two performance periods only adds to the complexity of the program, including the deciphering of appropriate financial distributions, if applicable.\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements snf 3 day waiver we agree with the proposal to expand eligibility for the snf 3-day waiver rule to include acos participating in a two-sided model under preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation.  additionally, while we understand that the quality of snf selection must be maintained, we suggest a re-evaluation of the indicators that qualify snfs to be included in the application acceptance criteria. in many areas of the country, including rural areas, snfs which successfully maintain a rating of 3 or more stars, as currently required, are limited.  this makes it difficult to utilize the waiver to its fullest potential. perhaps focusing on a certain category(s) under the cms 5-star quality rating system as reported on the nursing home compare website instead of an overall rating or including other ratings and qualifications may help with the successful utilization of the waiver.\n telehealth we agree that eligible physicians and practitioners in acos under performance-based risk and prospective assignment can receive payment for telehealth services furnished to prospectively assigned beneficiaries.  we recommend cms include acos participating in a two-sided model under preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation as eligible for the telehealth waiver.  thus, aco eligibility will be the same for both the snf and telehealth waivers.  it will create consistency and be more streamlined for cms to manage.\n beneficiary incentives we agree with cms. it will be beneficial to provide a mechanism for acos to offer beneficiary incentive programs.\n and its potential.  we think it is possible to set up appropriate boundaries and accounting mechanisms for any outside funds that they could be used judiciously.  if cms allows outside funds to be used, we expect the aco to have a public disclosure of the funding source(s).\n additional waivers / beneficiary enhancements we strongly encourage cms allow additional resources to better manage our high cost/complex patients. we suggest allowing acos to have a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgatekeeper\u00e2\u0080\u009d option with preauthorization needed for patients to see specialists or other primary care physicians outside the aco network. without the ability for the aco to create a network of preferred physicians and facilities it is unreasonable for cms to require the aco to be responsible for losses out of its control.\n beneficiary opt-in based on assignment methodology medicare advantage plan rgvha operates in a highly competitive medicare advantage plan region.  we have upwards of 15% leakage during each performance year.  we ask cms to level the playing field and allow mssp acos the appropriate flexibility and resources to retain beneficiaries to provide better care and demonstrate better outcomes.\n voluntary alignment we support the process of voluntarily alignment however, some of our offices have found the process burdensome.  rgvha proposes allowing for opt-in by telephone, mailing, and at the point of care in the physician office in addition to the current electronic method.\n opt-in enrollment process although an opt-in enrollment is a valuable idea and utilized by health plans, many acos do not have the infrastructure or the staff necessary to effectively operate such a process.  we urge medicare to provide acos with the same resources and funding allowed of managed care organizations to successfully run a marketing/patient opt-in program.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d hybrid approach rgvha partially supports a hybrid approach that would supplement an \u00e2\u0080\u009copt in\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach with a modified claims-based assignment approach that focuses on the most complex patients, such as high-risk patients or those receiving care for chronic conditions. this approach would only be successful with a closed/narrow network. assigning complex, high risk patients would only be supported if the aco provider is indeed the pcp and the pcp is actively involved in the patients care.  a gatekeeper model should be enforced in conjunction to this proposal to ensure the primary care physician is at the center of the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care\n benchmark cms-hcc risk scores newly and continuously assigned beneficiary distinction - we agree with removing this distinction.\n contract cycle.  with moving to a 5-year contract cycle, we recommend consideration of an asymmetrical cap, such as 3% downward and a 10% upward cap to be phased in over the 5-year contract cycle.  this will account for the aging of the population and natural progression of disease over the 5-year contract.  example: year 1 (3% down / 3% up); year 2 (3% down / 4% up); year 3 (3% down / 6% up); year 4 (3% down / 8% up); year 5 (3% down / 10% up).\n 5% regional adjustment cap rgvha opposes capping the regional adjustment amount using a flat dollar amount equal to 5 percent of national medicare ffs per capita expenditures. while we understand the rational to attempt to mitigate the effects of excessive positive or negative regional adjustments used to establish and reset the benchmark, we believe long term it will benefit the region in leveling cost as more organizations transition to value-based care. it will also provide an incentive for organizations above the regional expenditures to decrease costs and conversely, low cost organizations in the region to join the effort toward value-based care.  rgvha proposes the regional adjustment cap of 10 percent of the national medicare ffs per capita expenditures.\n thank you again for your work on behalf of patients and providers to advance value-based payment. we appreciate your interest in sustaining the success of medicare acos and creating an environment where providers are encouraged to enter into value-based payment arrangements and help patients receive high-quality, coordinate care.\n we are grateful for the opportunity to submit these comments and

risk\nmedicare acos have been successful in reducing healthcare costs and improving quality\nmedicare acos have saved $2 billion since 2012 by driving financial and clinical accountability, and they continue to improve those savings the more years the aco participates in the program\nacos not only lower costs/improve quality for assigned beneficiaries but care processes put into place also benefit broader community\nappreciate cms thoughtful consideration for improving the mssp program\nappreciate proposals such as positive adjustments to risk adjustment, incorporating regional expenditures into benchmark, expansion of waivers\ncritical that cms address three major concerns areas in the rule\nincreasing the shared savings rate\nslowing the transition to risk by allowing 3-4 years in upside only level for new acos\neliminating the distinction of high and low revenue acos\ncms should provide more flexibility to acos as they take on additional downside risk\ncms should incorporate approaches from next gen into mssp higher risk tracks: choice of enrolling tin or npi, infrastructure payment, prepayment of shared savings, primary care capitation\nredesigning participation options to facilitate performance-based risk\nproposals for modified participation options under 5-year agreement periods\nsupport 5-year agreement period; adds stability to program and allow aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to see impact of their efforts\ncreating a basic track with glide path to performance-based risk\nphase-in of performance risk in basic track\nthis progression to two-sided risk is far too aggressive and will deter participation.\nnumerous studies show that acos require about 3-4 years to become successful\nimplementing care processes that ensure success under a risk-based reimbursement model requires a significant investment of time, money, and administrative effort.\u00e2\u00a0 while we understand the need to transition to a risk-based method of reimbursement, accelerating this timeframe disrupts ongoing long-term strategies aimed at sustainably creating these care processes.\nthis is especially true for acos approaching the end of their first agreement period.\nmany of these acos will be forced to assume risk a year and a half earlier than expected.\nthis year and a half, while critical for health systems, may not significantly impact the federal government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term strategy of reducing healthcare spending.\nupdates to rules like the physician fee schedule are only now beginning to create a sustainable economic model for services like telehealth that can improve the quality of care while reducing cost.\u00e2\u00a0 the transition to risk should be supported by new billing codes that can sustainably allow for the implementation of these services.\nfor acos in their first agreement period in track 1, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only had the benefit of understanding our performance in this program for two years, and only recently received final financial reconciliation report for the 2nd performance year.\nacos in their first agreement period did not have the benefit of understanding what regional adjustment to our benchmark would mean for us\nfinally, 2017 was the first performance year in the quality payment program.\u00e2\u00a0 there are many areas of overlap between the qpp and the aco. we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a final qpp score for 2017 (secondary to the target review process). \u00e2\u00a0this creates challenges in arriving at a decision regarding whether to continue in the aco program or pursue the mips route\nrecommendation: allow 3-4 years of no downside risk\ncms could set parameters for successful acos to continue in a one-sided model for additional years (i.e. a fourth or fifth year for acos achieving savings, not necessarily shared savings, and high quality)\nshared savings\nlowering the shared-savings rate for acos with no downside risk from 50% to 25% makes the program significantly less attractive\nthis provides little incentive for new acos to join the program, it does not provide a sound business plan for organizations to enter a model that quickly transitions to risk\nthe low shared savings rate also does not take into account the investment needed on the part of both high and low-revenue acos. the investment required to put in place and sustain the elements necessary for a successful acos has been $11.6 to $26.1 million higher than previous estimates by cms, according to an analysis by the aha. these costs, coupled with the cost of having a repayment mechanism in place to cover losses, creates a high hurdle for organizations who are transitioning to accountable care.\nthe proposed shared savings rate is a significant decrease for existing acos, which will be unable to reinvest savings back into population management and care coordination. shared savings payments are critical as part of the transformation toward value-based care and are necessary to incentivize providers to make the infrastructure investments needed to transform care delivery and processes. without them, acos will struggle to provide care and services needed to appropriately manage the health of the population and move more rapidly to risk, undermining the overall goal of the program.\nreducing shared savings also produces problems with provider participation and buy-in in acos, as some organizations already find this difficult at current shared savings level.\nrecommendation: cms should maintain the current 50% shared savings rate for acos with no downside risk\nincreasing shared-savings rate as acos take on additional risk\nsupport that the shared savings rate increases as acos take on more risk in the basic glidepath\ncalculation of loss sharing limit\nsupport using lower of revenue-based or historical benchmark based\nin track e the level of risk should be exactly the nominal risk standard under qpp\nspecifically, the benchmark-based level of risk should be 3% rather than 4%\ncms provides no rationale for setting the benchmark-based loss limit at the nominal risk standard plus one percentage point\ntrack e set to meet the of an aapm,\nincreasing the benchmark-based loss limit creates an unlevel playing field for acos that include hospital participants\nacos with hospital participants will always use the historical-based benchmark since part a/b revenue will far exceed the historic benchmark\ncms should not unnecessarily subject acos with a hospital participant to additional risk.\ntrack e is designed to meet the qpp aapm requirements, the benchmark should align rather than being higher for acos with hospital participants\nstructuring the loss sharing limits so that acos with hospital participants have to take on more risk discourages acos from recruiting hospital participants\nthis is counter to the goal of acos to encourage various providers to work together to improve care\nthis approach discourages both health-system-led and physician-led acos from recruiting hospital participants\ntransition from level e to enhanced\nlevel e to enhanced is a significant increase in level of risk\ncms should create levels within the enhanced track to transition from level e to enhanced\npermitting annual participation elections\nelection of different levels of risk within basic glidepath\nrecommendation: if an aco selects a higher level of risk than it would have been automatically assigned, it should not be required to automatically advance the following year (i.e. an aco is not required to advance beyond the track they would have been assigned if they did not choose to advance to a higher track)\nacos may wish to move to a higher risk track and gain more experience there before moving to a track with even higher risk.\ncms could set parameters for successful acos to continue in a particular track prior to automatic advancing (i.e. achieving savings, not necessarily shared savings, and high quality)\nannual election of beneficiary assignment methodology- support\nparticipation options: medicare ffs revenue and prior participation\nlow-revenue vs. high-revenue acos\ndo not support any distinction between low-revenue and high-revenue acos\nunder the plan cms would require high-revenues to advance to the enhanced track after one year in basic-level e; conversely, low-revenue acos would be allowed a second agreement period in basic-level e\ncms argues that many low-revenue acos aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t well capitalized and unable to absorb losses\nregardless of structure, significant investments are needed in population health platforms and care process changes for acos to bear risk.\ncms is unable to identify if an aco is well capitalized through sources outside of medicare revenue (i.e. insurer or investor backed acos); cms is unable to truly identify whether an aco is well capitalized and should not create distinctions based on assumptions about capital\nsetting up a system that disadvantages hospital-led acos limits the types of innovations needed to build a high performing healthcare system for the range of communities across the nation.\nthe best way to drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate to innovate and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare.\nthis policy will simply lead to acos restructuring tins to avoid including hospital participants even if the hospital is actively involved in redesigning care processes to lower cost and improve quality of the aco population.\ncms approach for comparing revenue to expenditures disadvantages acos that treat more complex patients that have higher expenditures\nthe goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively.  including a hospital is an effective way to balance the need for access to specialty care while increasing the focus on primary care.  this should be about raising the bar for everyone and not disadvantaging one provider group over another\nrecommendations: cms should allow all acos to remain in track e or whatever track meets the nominal risk requirements under qpp\nif cms increases the qpp aapm nominal risk threshold, cms should create a glidepath in mssp for acos to transition to the new standard of risk\ncms seeks comments on greater potential reward for low-revenue acos\nas stated earlier cms should not create arbitrary distinctions for acos based on their medicare\nparticipation options based on prior participation\nrenewing/reentering- support definitions and 50% threshold\nexperienced- support definition; increase threshold from 40% to 50% to align with new/re-entering\nencourage cms to monitor these impact of this policy and consider creating an appeals process\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that two separate acos discontinue operation in a region then a new entity, completely unaffiliated with either prior entity, forms in the region and recruits participants involved in the prior organization\nthe intent of the policy is to avoid gaming of the options for the glidepath not to discourage new entities\ncms should also consider a second criteria, setting a threshold for a percentage of participants that all previously were in the same entity. for example, first identify if 50% of participants would qualify aco to be reentering or experienced; then if less than 30% of participants were a part of the same legal entity the aco could appeal the label of reentering or experienced\nmonitoring for financial performance\noppose cms policy to terminate acos if negative outside corridor for two agreement periods\ncms does not need to terminate acos if all are forced to move to two-sided risk\nif cms extends the time acos can remain in downside risk, this policy should be amended to terminate acos if they are negative outside corridor for three agreement periods\nrepayment for early termination\ndo not support proposal to set termination date to avoid repayment of losses at june 30\ndate to terminate without repaying losses should be 30 days after receipt of second quarter data; prior to this acos have insufficient information to make termination decisions\nrequirements for aco participation in two-sided models\nelection of msr/mlr by acos-

make available summary information about the use of the beneficiary incentive program available when aco program results are released. this information will be useful to other acos as they consider implementation of the program\nempowering beneficiary choice: beneficiary notifications\nwe understand cms intent to provide beneficiaries with more information\nrequiring additional notification at the first primary care visit of the performance year introduces additional burden for clinicians participating in an aco\nimplementing this requirement would require the clinicians performing primary care visits to reformat their ehr systems to include reminder prompts and documentation of sharing this beneficiary information\nprior efforts to require acos to directly notify beneficiaries resulted in beneficiary confusion, many acos had to dedicate staff to answering questions after release of beneficiary notifications\ncms should first provide information to beneficiaries about the aco they are aligned with and the option to identify a primary doctor; then the aco could follow-up with targeted aco information. this sequencing will help reduce confusion for beneficiaries\nwhen acos disseminate information they should have the ability to provide information in the manner of beneficiary choice; for example if an beneficiary could opt to receive notifications via email\nempowering beneficiary choice:  opt-in assignment methodology\ncms should maintain the existing methodology and avoid replacing it with the hybrid methodology\ncms should test methods for beneficiaries directly opt-in to participating in an aco\nbenchmarking methodology refinements\nrisk adjustment methodology\nappreciate that cms has eliminated distinction of new and continuously aligned beneficiaries for purposes of risk adjustment\nappreciate that cms recognizes that risk scores should increase or decrease during the course of the agreement period; this recognizes that the beneficiary population underlying health changes with time\nthe cap of +/- 3% is too restrictive; +/- 5% would more accurately account for changes in risk over a performance period\nideally, to incent acos to move to risk, cms should provide additional flexibility in accounting for the risk of the population\nset an annual cap for all acos\nallow the cap to increase as acos take on additional risk\nuse of regional factors\nsupport incorporating regional adjustment into the initial agreement period\ndo not support lowering the regional contribution to below 50%; current maximum contribution of 70% should be maintained\nsupport policy to cap regional adjustment at 5% of national expenditures to control for outliers\nupdating program policies\nrevisions to policies on voluntary alignment\nsupport revisions in accordance with bba\nif beneficiary selects a specialist as main doctor, beneficiary should have at least one primary care service from an aco professional\nrevisions to definition of primary care used in beneficiary assignment\nsupport; changes to identification of snf e/m codes will better identify beneficiaries provided short-term care that should not be assigned to aco\nprogram data and

from nqf-map on measures best enabled in apms and direct funds to measure development in those areas\nthe proposal should be revised to ensure that providers and health systems are incentivized to address social determinants of health and health disparities\nalthough reducing documentation burden is a laudable goal, striking process measures could unfairly impact the quality scores of providers who care for vulnerable patients exposed to the harshest social determinants of health.\npromoting interoperability\nsupport cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to remove aco measure 11 and instead rely

aapm acos\nwe urge cms to clarify that acos subject to the merit-based incentive payment system (mips) would not be required to report promoting interoperability (pi) and would instead see pi performance category weights redistributed equally to the quality and improvement activities performance categories\npharmacy coordination comment requests\ncms should work to make all beneficiary data, including pharmacy data available readily\ncms should explore methods (e.g. portals, data sets accessed with api) to provide acos real-time (at the time of receipt) access of to claims data, including pharmacy claims, for beneficiaries aligned with the aco.\nreal-time access can allow acos to build provider alerts and help better manage patient care\n\n\n", "0221": "the proposed rule

accountable care organizations \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 pathways to success (cms 1701-p)\n\n dear administrator verma:\n\n novartis appreciates the opportunity to submit this letter regarding the medicare shared savings program and accountable care organizations \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 pathways to success proposed rule.\n\n novartis provides healthcare solutions that address the evolving needs of patients and societies worldwide. our broad portfolio includes innovative pharmaceuticals and oncology medicines, generic and biosimilar medicines, and eye care devices. at novartis, we are united by a single mission:\n reimagining medicine to improve and extend people\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s lives. through science-based innovation we address some of society's most challenging healthcare issues. every day we work to discover and develop breakthrough treatments and find new ways to deliver them to as many people as possible.\n\n in the proposed rule, cms redesigns options for participating in the medicare shared savings program (mssp). two participation tracks, basic and enhanced, replace the current participation options. in creating these two tracks, participating acos would be required to take on more downside risk faster than is currently required. ultimately, cms wants participating acos to be in a two-sided risk arrangement because cms believes this type of arrangement will result in increased net savings for the program. however, if the emphasis in the program is hyperfocused on cost savings, there is a potential for under-treatment or decreased quality of care as a way to contain costs below the determined threshold. therefore, we encourage cms to apply a quality measure set that will evaluate the breadth of chronic conditions common in the mssp patient population and use appropriate outcome measures to ensure medicare beneficiaries are receiving all necessary care.\n\n in order for a healthcare organization to perform optimally within a shared savings arrangement, it is critical for care to be coordinated, data to be shared, and providers to communicate and rely on each other to achieve optimal clinical outcomes while managing cost of care. within this risk-sharing environment, there is potential to identify new ways to improve healthcare quality through application of measurement, improvement activities, and learning from the results. information gleaned from\n\n\n 1 83 cfr 41786 (august 17, 2018) [hereinafter \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3proposed rule\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5.\n\n quality and cost measurement can help to better identify areas of care in need of improvement and interventions that might yield those needed improvements.\n\n as cms continues to identify ways to better account for program spending, we encourage the agency to continue its commitment to better define high-quality outcomes for patients. the administration has already undertaken a number of initiatives to do so \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 including the meaningful measure initiative (mmi)\n included in this year\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed physician fee schedule rule.* the extent to which outcome measurement development can support a balanced approach to ensure patient quality is in fact improved, while still affecting total cost of care, is applicable under the goals of the mmi. inherent to the mssp is the goal of decreasing overall cost, which makes it even more important to safeguard quality of care.\n\n in the medicare physician fee schedule proposed rule, cms proposed changes to the mssp quality measure set, continuing in its efforts to advance quality of care, emphasize outcomes, and decrease reporting burden. to these ends, cms proposed changes that would result in removing 10 measures and adding one measure to the mssp quality measure set.\n\n we reiterate that we support streamlining the measure set. we support removing process measures that otherwise could be enveloped within outcome measures already included in the measure set.\n we also support the move toward use of outcome measures, as we believe that the emphasis on improved health outcomes is the appropriate focus and goal. however, in removing many measures from the set, we note that the resulting proposed set is relatively small \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 24 measures \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 which makes it challenging to evaluate all areas of care within the program. we note that nearly half of the proposed measure set \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 10 of 24 \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 would be cahps patient experience measures. while evaluation of patient experience is important and needed, patient experience survey answers may not provide a full, clear picture of healthcare quality. therefore, novartis supports inclusion of additional clinical quality measures that would evaluate a broader range of chronic conditions commonly found in the medicare population typically cared for within mssp. we note that the current proposed measure set does not include measures related to respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma or additional cardiovascular conditions like heart failure; we support including measures that evaluate care for these conditions. we recognize that these conditions would be included in the all-cause readmission measure, but we believe that revealing condition-specific results could allow for more quickly evaluating current practice and making changes that will improve patient care and outcomes. furthermore, we also support inclusion of measures that evaluate adherence to medication used to treat chronic conditions, because appropriate medication use is critical in managing these diseases. these measures would be complementary to the proposed admission and readmission measures and could serve to evaluate additional areas of care not already included in the set.\n\n we also recommend that cms continue to strive toward a core measure set that identifies and harmonizes measures across the mssp, hospital inpatient quality reporting program, hospital value-based purchasing program, hospital outpatient quality reporting program, and mips. we believe this is necessary so that incentives and goals are aligned across healthcare providers. in cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 medicare shared savings program fast facts from january 2018\u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u0096\u0091, 58% of participating accountable care organizations are combined physicians, hospitals, and other facilities, making it critical that all of these stakeholders are striving toward the same healthcare goals. attempts at creating and implementing core sets have been made, but successful implementations have not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2 https:/awww.cms

with the sponsors of stand-alone part d pdps (part d sponsors) to improve the coordination of pharmacy care for medicare ffs beneficiaries to reduce the risk of adverse events and improve medication adherence.\n\n cms requests comment on how mssp acos and part d prescription drug plan sponsors (pdps)\n could work together to improve coordination of pharmacy care. novartis supports cms in the effort of aiding medicare acos and pdps in better collaboration as it stands to enhance care coordination, improve medication use, and boost medication adherence. policymakers and government actuaries have long recognized the role that appropriate medication use can play in helping to improve patient outcomes and reduce spending under federal programs. policies that improve beneficiary access and adherence to prescribed medications have been found by the congressional budget office and other entities to improve care quality and reduce costs by preventing the use of medical services.4\n a recent analysis\u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ab found that while acos continue to build strategies to enhance medication use, challenges remain with both notification related to prescription use and measurement of the medication use on costs and quality outcomes. the research revealed several barriers to implementing more comprehensive medication strategies at acos, including:\n\n e lack of reimbursement for pharmacists\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 services,\n e poor technology interoperability, and\n e difficulty isolating and evaluating the cost savings associated with better medication use practices.\n\n for such a partnership to work well and to address these challenges, real-time data sharing is needed between cms, the aco, and the pdp so that relevant clinical information about patients can support clinical decision-making. currently, a pdp does not have the ability to reap any medical benefit savings as a result of optimized medication treatment, but a partnership between an aco and the pdp might create the right synergy to allow each entity to benefit from the other partner\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s work. a prime example of this is in the medication therapy management (mtm) program, where beneficiaries who have high medication costs, use multiple medications, and/ or have multiple chronic conditions are to have their medication regimens evaluated by a pharmacist or other provider to ensure that they are receiving the right treatments for their conditions. allowing acos and pdps to collaborate potentially provides the pdps all the necessary tools to perform a comprehensive medication review, counsel the patient on how to correctly take his medications, and monitor for any patient side effects or safety issues, while providing the potential for a financial arrangement between the two organizations to both benefit from this type of intensive review.\n\n such a partnership also could provide opportunity for medication synchronization refill programs, whereby the pharmacy simplifies the refill process for patients with multiple chronic medications by enabling the patient to pick up all their medications on a single date. at that time, the pharmacist can offer any needed medication information, evaluate the regimen for any safety issues, and assess if\n\n\n 4 cbo: offsetting drug use on

cms proceeds with allowing these types of partnerships, we encourage cms to preserve the structural aspects of part d that are working well. cost should not be prioritized over quality in this \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 or any \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 arrangement, as that erroneous prioritization could result in under-treatment and decreased quality of care. further, care should be taken to prevent any potential gaming by either organization in the arrangement; such an arrangement should not be misused to cherry-pick beneficiaries. lastly, this type of arrangement should not interfere with physician prescribing choices, as treatment selection should be a shared decision between the patient and his physician.\n\n krkkekkk\n we appreciate the opportunity to

attention: cms-1701-p\np.o. box 8016 \n page 2 \u0000 memorandum yet it is the experience of our aco in mssp that underscores the potential that enhanced physician and nurse practitioner engagernent and improved care coordination among an interdisciplinary team offers to significantly transforrn medical care delivery for the majority of medicare beneficiaries we serve, those who are long-term care residents living in our nursing facilities. the value of the model has been borne out over many years in the institutional special needs plan (i-snps) within medicare advantage, though operationalizing this model through mssp affords the potential of significantly greater scalability, as over one million traditional medicare beneficiaries currently reside in roughly 15,000 u.s. nursing homes. other programs that target the dual eligible population are primarily focused on expanding community-based supports to enable medicare beneficiaries to remain at home longer with greater potential at earlier stages of disease progression, while mssp can serve to address the complex needs of medicare beneficiaries already residing in long-term care settings many of whom are approaching the end of life. in fact, over 94 percent of genesis healthcare aco attributable beneficiaries live their remaining months and years within our centers without ever being discharged back to the community setting. in addition to improving care delivery for our residents, mssp has the potential to expand access to care by providing an attractive opportunity for providers practicing in nursing facilities, who have limited available pathways to advanced payment models, to participate directly in a value- based model. however, our ability to dernonstrate the significant potential that exists through this program hinges on the continued thoughtful consideration of the effect these and future rule changes may have on medicare's costliest population.\ni. accurate benchmark development \n page 5 \u0000 memorandum mailed the survey. this approach results in extremely low sample size of responses and statistical insignificance. in fact, cahps surveys completed for genesis healthcare aco in 2017 ranged from only 21 to 65 surveys, representing .2% to .7% of our attributed beneficiaries. furthermore, those sampled are entirely non-representative of our aco population that reside in the long-term care setting, and will not likely associate the care they received during their nursing facility stay with the primary care that is the subject of the survey. the implications of this inappropriate approach to garnering customer satisfaction with the delivery of primary care in our aco, especially the potential for extremely low results on the cahps survey, may in any performance year disqualify our aco frorn any shared savings altogether regardless of savings generated and achievement of quality perforrnance on other measures. as cms's use of cahps is not mandated by statute or regulation - law and regulations are general about what needs to be measured and do not dictate any specific survey tool - cms may implement a de rninimis cut- point so that cahps would only be required when a significant portion of the aco population is eligible to receive the survey, or excluded if only a nominal percentage are completed. in such situations, the associated points could be redistributed to the remaining quality measures and the patient experience domain requirement would automatically be satisfied. the agency also could consider a substitution of a validated survey of nursing home residents which assesses similar issues of provider access and experience intended by the current survey in lieu of the use of the cahps tool. de minimis standard for other quality measures similar to the concerns raised regarding cahps, other quality measures also systematically exclude institutionalized patients. depression remission at 12 months (aco-40) is one such measure. nursing home patients are excluded from the denominator. as a result, like cahps, this leads to miniscule sample sizes for acos like ours, resulting in a non-representative and statistically meaningless result. a de minimis standard should be applied here as well. institutional population adjustment to utilization metrics hospital utilization for our population is more than three times that of the average aco population. the higher average incidence of all-cause unplanned admissions for patients with multiple chronic conditions (aco-38) for institutional beneficiaries is not accounted for in the determination of scoring for quality metrics, realistically putting achievement for our population out of reach and precluding our ability to achieve 100%. we recommend that quality metric performance be measured against benchmarks adjusted to reflect the weighted average of institutionalized vs community-based beneficiaries, using the respective mean performance rate, 30% and 90% percentile benchmarks for each subset population.\n111. required risk-takhig \n page 6 \u0000 memorandum providers will be at-risk for the first time; this may enable the placernent of appropriate risk protection contracts. we support the treatment of level e as an advanced apm to acknowledge the assumption of risk and encourage greater participation at higher risk tracks. we recommend removal of restrictions preventing providers who begin at level e from moving up to the enhanced track without an interruption in their existing agreernent or the redetermination of benchmarks; rather, we would prefer that all levels of gainsharing and risk assumption be on a single platform to facilitate the continuous movement to higher thresholds. further, we would wish to see the highest level include the ability to earn 100% of savings, particularly as the next gen program sunsets. as a skilled nursing facility operator, we work closely with upstream hospital and physician providers in many markets across the country to improve outcomes for shared patient populations. we are concerned about the implications on patient health and appropriate care delivery that may result from mandatory risk assumption for existing acos. even in the current environment, some acos and at-risk hospitals exert pressure on skilled nursing providers to discharge patients sooner than may be appropriate, drawing influence from their ability to direct referral volume. while we agree that real change occurs more readily in a risk-based environment, we recommend that cms continue to move slowly, both by enabling providers to proceed into risk at their own pace and by ensuring that adequate safeguards and patient protections are in place to support patient safety above all else. given difficulties we have experienced across multiple performance years related to issues outside of our control that have impacted the deterrnination of our benchmarks, we are concerned about the imposition of early termination policies that penalize acos that do not generate savings. these proposed changes will harm patients and providers by limiting the improvements in savings and quality acos achieve, potentially slowing progress in transitioning to value-base payments.\niv. improvement in assignment methodology \n we support the added flexibility to enable acos to choose prospective or retrospective assignment methodology annually regardless of risk level. we also support a hybrid approach to enable beneficiaries to either voluntarily align with an aco-participating physician or nurse practitioner of their choice or to opt-in to the aco directly, though we recommend voluntary or opt-in alignment be renewed within the first year following determination of institutional status as the majority of community-based providers do not  follow patients into the long-term care setting. it was principally this lack in primary care coverage and timely and consistent access to medical providers that drove the creation of the genesis physician services organization and our\naco. the hybrid approach could be extended universally to all acos by default provided \n page 7 \u0000 memoranduni nurse practitioners (nps) and physician assistants (pas) for attribution consistent with cms regulations, nps and pas provide much of the care required by long-term care patients in many nursing homes. the role of the physician varies, with many physicians delegating their long-term care visits to thern. for this reason, we recommend cms reconsider the requirement of one physician visit by an aco participant, particularly in this care setting, where the plurality of primary care by an np or pa should suffice. for the same reason, we are supportive of voluntary alignment processes which permit attribution to an np or pa without requiring any additional aco physician visit. claims-based determination of place of service 31 and 32 we appreciate the proposed change in determination of place of service (pos) using medicare claims for skilled nursing facility stays, though caution cms to accommodate the longer claims runout period necessary as a result of post-acute billing practices before completing final aco beneficiary attribution, and would welcome transparency related to pos 31 and 32 clairns-based attribution on quarterly cclfs as this information becomes available.\nv. assumption of downside risk upon exit \n given that the mssp is still a developing program in which significant adjustments that are unknowable to acos are made to benchmarks at annual settlements that are completed far into the ensuing year providing limited time for planning and decision-making, we oppose the more stringent requirements to assume greater risk for losses during a year of voluntary termination. voluntary termination should be understood by cms as a hobson's choice, as most acos have invested significant resources to participate in mssp and likely exit only as a last resort.\nvi. expanded use of waivers for telehealth and skilled nursing facility use \n page 8 \u0000 memorandum\nvii. additional time for 2019 renewal \n\n", "0243":

quality and efficient service delivery through increased accountability and an emphasis on care coordination. apma also appreciates that accountable care organizations (acos), like those under mssp, provide one of the main vehicles for health care professionals to achieve qualifying alternative payment model (apm)\n participant (qp) status under the medicare quality payment program (qpp). at the same time, we recognize that change is needed in the mssp to fully realize its potential in these areas. as cms contemplates changes for mssp, we urge cms to consider our comments and recommendations below.\n\n engagement of podiatrists in acos and other alternative payment models (apms)\n\n apma is concerned about the limited opportunities for meaningful engagement in acos for specialists, and in particular for podiatric physicians. podiatrists are classified as physicians under social security act section 1861(r)(3). podiatric physicians receive basic and clinical science education and training comparable to that of medical doctors, with four years of undergraduate education focusing on life sciences, four years of graduate study in one of the nine podiatric medical colleges, and at least three years of postgraduate, hospital-based residency training. this training, education, and experience enable podiatrists to serve an important role in managing care and improving outcomes for patients with significant health risks.\n\n while we do not have robust data on podiatrists\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 participation in apms, including acos, anecdotal information suggests fairly limited participation. at the same time, we believe that there are opportunities for podiatrists to contribute to acos, while also improving the care that patients receive.\n\n 1\n american podiatric medical association, inc.\n\n particularly for patients with diabetes, a comprehensive foot exam can help to prevent complications such as ulcerations, infection, cellulitis, and ultimately limb loss. indeed, the american diabetes association has endorsed care guidelines that include performance of annual comprehensive foot examinations for patients with diabetes. additionally, research has shown that podiatric intervention can reduce health care costs and prevent complications for patients with diabetes. \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5*\n acos offer a promising opportunity to partner with podiatrists to address diabetes care. however, there are many limitations that they currently face. annual preventive foot exams for patients with diabetes are not currently covered by the medicare program. and to the extent that at-risk foot care is covered for patients who meet specific diagnosis and class findings, the current limitations imposed by coverage policies and medicare administrative contractor (mac) determinations may mean that patients cannot and do not receive the care that is most appropriate for their condition.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096\n apma requests that cms encourage acos to work with podiatrists to deliver more appropriate care through specific policy changes that would encourage appropriate foot care for patients with diabetes.\n for example, cms could waive existing statutory, regulatory, and sub-regulatory restrictions on the delivery of annual comprehensive diabetic foot and lower extremity exams for patients with diabetes and related at-risk foot care, and allow such services to be provided without cost-sharing. cms could further define such services as primary care services that would allow patients to receive incentive payments under beneficiary incentive programs. cms could also build additional quality metrics into the mssp that focus on rates of diabetic foot exams, and/or related outcomes (for example related to foot and limb amputations) to assess acos on their provision of these services. these kinds of changes would encourage early assessment and identification of foot complications for patients with diabetes that would in turn improve health outcomes and patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 quality of life.\n\n more broadly, we believe cms could test a model, independently and in the context of the mssp and other existing models, that focuses on the universal delivery of annual comprehensive lower extremity exams to patients with diabetes. patients who receive a comprehensive diabetic lower extremity exam would then be stratified into high, medium, and low risk tiers, and podiatrists and other qualified practitioners could then manage patients, as needed, based on their risk. such a model would be necessary to establish access to such a preventive service, as well as conclusively demonstrate through a well-designed prospective study the quality and cost saving impacts of comprehensive diabetic lower extremity exams that currently available retrospective data support. we would be pleased to work with cms in the development of such a model.\n\n mssp quality measures\n cms solicits comments on possible changes to the mssp measure set to support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 meaningful measures initiatives. as described above, apma encourages cms to incorporate new quality measures into the mssp that would encourage acos to improve patient outcomes related to chronic disease, particularly related to diabetic foot care. these could include measures focused on the delivery of comprehensive diabetic lower extremity exams for patients with diabetes, and rates of complications such\n\n\n ; ginger carls et al.,

re: proposed rule for medicare program; medicare shared savings program: accountable care organizations-pathways to success (cms-1701-p)\n\n dear administrator verma:\n\n the blue cross blue shield association (bcbsa) \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 a national federation of 36 independent, community- based, and locally operated blue cross and blue shield (bcbs) companies (plans) that collectively provide healthcare coverage for one in three americans \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed rule for the medicare shared savings program (mssp) as issued in the federal register on aug. 17, 2018 (83 fr 41786).\n\n we believe that the overarching goal of delivery system and payment reform should be to transition from a system based on fee-for-service (ffs) design to one that pays based on quality, safety, and effectiveness of care. we welcome the contributions that accountable care organizations (acos) have made to date in the medicare marketplace and believe that more savings and higher quality can be gained with two-sided risk arrangements.\n\n bcbs companies have been actively engaged in transforming our healthcare system from one based on ffs to a system based on quality and performance. in fact, today, bcbs plans across the nation are spending 31 percent of medical claims dollars in programs that provide incentives for better health outcomes while reducing costly duplication and waste in care delivery.\n\n our comments are informed by bcbs plans and bcbsa\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s extensive experience pioneering innovative payment approaches that move away from ffs and toward quality and outcomes-based payment. bcbs plans partner with more than 342,000 providers who are providing value-based care and collectively cover more than 61 million members through acos and patient-centered medical homes (pcmhs)\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 2 of 13\n\n\n across all 50 states and the district of columbia. through these collaborations, bcbs plans are seeing positive results through partnerships that incentivize more accountable care. for example:\n\n independence blue cross\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 (ibc) primary care incentive program is designed to promote high- quality, accessible and cost-effective care and works in tandem with ibc's aco payment model to incent and energize primary care physicians into re-emerging as leaders in accountable care.\n the program has demonstrated a 24 percent decrease in avoidable emergency room visits, a 20 percent decrease in medical admissions, well-child visit rates that were 35 percent better than the national average, breast cancer screening rates that were 17 percent better than the national average, and other meaningful improvements.\n\n blue cross and blue shield of south carolina deploys dedicated innovation specialists to its pcmhs to help physicians transform their practices across leadership, clinical and administrative levels to improve patient health and address costs. in 2017, the program resulted in a 9 percent decrease in emergency room visits for medical home patients. per member per month claims for members in these practices were 6 percent lower. and hospital admission rates were 10 percent lower per 1,000 patients. the program has also shown an overall 2 percent cost savings for members with the target conditions.\n\n carefirst bluecross blueshield\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s pcmh and complementary total care & cost improvement (tcci) program, launched in 2011, gives providers the resources they need to deliver higher- quality, more coordinated care. pcmh physicians are grouped into panels of 10 to 15 to coordinate the care of members with the most pressing healthcare needs. panels earn additional payments based on the quality of care provided and savings achieved. the tcci program provides additional supports to address the complex needs of patients with behavioral health, chronic condition and home care needs. the program has helped to slow the annual growth in healthcare costs to just 3.4 percent, compared to 7.5 percent prior to the program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s inception.\n a savings of nearly $1 billion since 2011, including 10.5 percent fewer hospital admissions, 17.1 percent fewer days in the hospital, and 34.7 percent fewer hospital readmissions for all causes per 1,000 carefirst bluecross blueshield members attributed to the program.\n\n we commend cms for making vigorous efforts to encourage the transition to two-sided risk models \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 a prominent focus of the updated mssp. bcbs plans\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 experience shows that, by itself, a payment system incorporating only shared savings may indeed yield some improvements in cost and quality, but it cannot begin to have the power to reshape practice patterns as effectively as a system that also puts providers at risk for losses.\n\n we urge cms to consider the following priority issues as it finalizes the rule:\n\n first, we commend cms for making vigorous efforts to encourage the transition to two-sided risk models by streamlining the participation tracks. the move to value is inescapable and cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 efforts to innovate and encourage providers will help drive needed change to get there. we encourage cms to carefully monitor these efforts to support their continued growth and improvement.\n\n second, we agree with cms that an opt-in assignment option for beneficiaries is redundant with the voluntary provider alignment option beneficiaries have already and would likely lead to beneficiary confusion on the differences between acos under mssp and medicare advantage\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 3 of 13\n\n\n (ma) plans. we encourage cms to continue to enhance the voluntary provider alignment option as proposed under this rule rather than implementing an opt-in methodology.\n\n e third, aco waivers and inducements should not involve \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3steerage\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 or payment for items like part b premiums, medigap or other such significant \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3inducements.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 while we applaud the agency for moving in the right direction, we are concerned that such waivers or inducement could undermine the medicare advantage program, which is a stable and attractive program that 19 million beneficiaries rely on today.\n\n e fourth, we encourage cms to make certain that acos are not viewed by beneficiaries as an equivalent alternative to fully risk-based ma plans. ma plans use risk-based provider arrangements and the flexibility ma provides to improve outcomes for patients, delivering demonstrable meaningful outcomes (e.g., high star ratings). as you know, the sponsoring organizations of ma plans must be state-licensed and meet state solvency standards \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 these are steps that cms has required since implementing these risk-based, capitated programs. we believe these safeguards, including mandating an organization has a governing board, requiring a financial status that includes reserves, and ensuring consumer protections are in place, are integral to the accountability and success of the program as a whole. bcbsa understands the need for more two-sided, risk-based acos to serve traditional ffs medicare beneficiaries and drive towards improved outcomes and efficiency, but should meet all of the standards and protections required of other risk-bearing organization.\n\n we offer detailed comments and recommendations in the subsequent sections, following the structure of the notice: (a) redesigning participation options, (b) ffs benefit enhancements, (c) beneficiary engagement tools, and (d) updating program policies.\n\n comments on the proposed rule for the medicare program; medicare shared savings program (mssp): accountable care organizations (aco)-pathways to success\n\na. redesigning participation options\n\n issue: redesigning participation options to facilitate performance-based risk\n cms proposes to replace the existing three-track participation model with a two-track (basic and enhanced) model. the new basic track would replace the existing tracks 1, 1+ and 2, offering a path from a one-sided model to progressively higher increments of risk and reward. the new enhanced track would replace the existing track 3 for acos that take on the highest level of risk and potential reward. furthermore, agreements would last for a period of five years.\n\n recommendation #1:\n\n we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed streamlining of the aco participation tracks and specifically agree with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to extend the length of agreement periods from three to five years.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 4 of 13\n\n\n rationale #1:\n\n we strongly support and commend cms for making vigorous efforts to encourage the transition to two- sided risk models by streamlining the participation tracks. bcbs plans\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 experience shows that, by itself, a payment system incorporating only shared savings may indeed yield some improvements in cost and quality, but it cannot begin to have the power to reshape practice patterns as effectively as a system that also puts providers at risk for losses.\n\n since the mssp overlays a ffs framework, it is essential that incentives are powerful enough to overcome the inherent limitations of ffs medicine. therefore, we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 continued push to hold acos accountable for losses. in addition, a longer agreement period provides aco participants, cms and beneficiaries with a greater level of consistency and predictability. this should help participants better plan and prepare for their increased responsibilities.\n\n recommendation #2:\n\n bcbsa recommends that cms consider a smaller change in the shared savings rate from track 1 (50 percent share savings rate) to the basic track (25 percent - 50 percent).\n\n rationale #2:\n\n we believe that reducing the shared saving rate under the basic track would limit the risk for newly created acos, and therefore, enable greater participation. while we support the move to encourage acos to take on more risk, we understand that a higher rate initially may serve as a barrier to entry and could, therefore, limit the success of the mssp in the long run.\n\n recommendation #3:\n\n we commend cms for working to address issues of a limited subset of acos potentially gaming the program and avoiding taking of down-side risk. we recommend that cms carefully monitor participation moving forward to support these changes and future refinements of the approach.\n\n rationale #3:\n\n we agree that instituting more rigorous screening of acos and providers for good standing and previous mssp participation, as well as instituting accountability for partial-year losses along with the updated glide path, will help address concerns with acos not acting in good faith.\n\n however, it is likely some acos will drop out of the program, and fewer new organizations will choose to start under the more accelerated glide path. while this will also likely mean that the remaining acos participating will be more dedicated and driven to meet the goals of the program, careful monitoring of participation trends (e.g., what acos are dropping out, when are acos dropping out, what type of acos are forming) may help inform modifications needed to the program as we move forward.\n\n issue: basic track with glide path to performance-based risk\n under the proposed basic track, cms plans to implement a five-level glide path that includes a one- sided risk model for no more than the first two consecutive performance years and three levels of progressively higher risk and potential reward for at least the last three performance years of the five year agreement. acos would be required to move to the enhanced track after one agreement period in the basic track.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 5 of 13\n\n\n recommendation:\n\n we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 goal of facilitating acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 transition to performance-based risk more quickly through the updated basic track glide path to performance-based risk.\n\n rationale:\n\n a shared savings-only model for acos meeting quality and cost growth targets does not fully incentivize acos to become more effective and efficient. while we recognize the need to not accelerate movement into risk-bearing arrangements for those providers that are not ready, we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 implementation of a faster glide path to assume greater risk.\n\n our plans\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 experience demonstrates that, with adequate support, many providers can be ready for two- sided risk within a few years. given the unique size and scope of the medicare program, the mssp represents an important opportunity for cms to drive meaningful change in the system.\n\n issue: proposals for assignment of beneficiaries\n the bipartisan budget act of 2018 required cms to provide greater flexibility in the assignment of medicare ffs beneficiaries to acos by allowing acos in tracks under retrospective beneficiary assignment a choice of prospective assignment for the agreement period. as such, cms is proposing to provide all acos with a choice of prospective assignment or preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation and to allow for acos to select their assignment methodology on an annual basis.\n\n recommendation:\n\n we support cm9q\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to make prospective assignment available to all tracks, regardless of one- sided or two-sided risk. in addition, we recommend that cms clarify the following:\n e what the process will be for assignment and what communications would be involved.\n e how the retrospective versus prospective methodology would impact shared savings/losses calculations.\n e whether there be full disclosure to beneficiaries upon assignment to an aco and expectations as to the network of providers.\n e whether beneficiaries assigned can receive care outside of an aco at any given time.\n e what the process will be if a beneficiary wants to opt-out of the program.\n\n rationale:\n\n as there is no clear industry consensus as to which method of assignment is preferable, we commend cms for proposing to make prospective assignment available to all acos. as this moves forward, it would be helpful to understand the nuances of how this will work in the new two-track model. additional details will help stakeholders identify and, to the extent possible, address any unintended negative impacts to beneficiaries.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 6 of 13\n\n\n issue: monitoring for financial performance\n cms proposes to monitor whether the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s expenditures for its assigned beneficiary population are \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3negative outside corridor,\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 meaning that the expenditures exceed the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark by an amount equal to or exceeding either 1) the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s negative minimum savings rate (msr) under a one-sided model or 2) the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s medical loss ratio (mlr) under a two-sided model.\n\n recommendation #1:\n\n bcbsa supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 efforts to hold acos accountable, but recommends a remediation path for acos so as not to deter participation. one approach could be to provide a probationary period where acos have a year to improve their expenditures before termination from the program.\n\n rationale #1:\n\n as mentioned earlier, we commend cms for working to address issues of acos not acting in good faith and/or not meeting the goals of the mssp program. however, with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 more ambitious push for acos to take on risk under the streamlined basic and enhanced tracks, it is likely some acos will drop out of the program, and fewer new organizations will choose to start. while this will also likely mean that the remaining acos participating will be more dedicated and driven to meet the goals of the program, it does not necessarily mean that they will immediately be more successful. by providing acos opportunities to improve their expenditures whenever possible prior to termination \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 through use of probationary periods or corrective action plans \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 cms can help ensure the continued viability and growth of the mssp.\n\n recommendation #2:\n\n bcbsa recommends that cms provide more guidance and clarification in this area on its planned timing for determining actions (e.g., when cms and the aco know it is underperforming versus when participation decisions need to be made).\n\n rationale #2:\n\n timing for making these determinations is complicated. specifically, it can be challenging to assess how an aco has performed until well into its second year, making it difficult to determine or take an appropriate action until the third year. if an aco performs poorly in year one, but performs well in year two, then it seems reasonable that the aco should be allowed to participate in year four. if termination action is taken based on year-one results, this may not happen.\n\n\nb. ffs benefit enhancements\n\n issue: aco definitions (high-revenue/low-revenue and experienced/inexperienced\n\n\n cms discussed distinguishing acos based on their degree of control over total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for their assigned beneficiaries by identifying low-revenue versus high-revenue acos.\n specifically, cms proposes to define acos by the proportion of revenue through an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s beneficiaries versus an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s total expenditures. in addition, cms proposes to identify the available participation options for an aco (regardless of whether it is applying to enter, re-enter or renew its participation in the program) by considering the level of risk with which the aco or its participants have experience based on participation in medicare aco initiatives in recent years.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 7 of 13\n\n\n recommendation:\n\n bcbsa supports the proposed definitions, but recommends cms clarify the timelines and detailed processes for how it will monitor, review and communicate changes on the different categories.\n\n rationale:\n\n bcbsa believes that it is important that cms provide ample time to allow acos to consider their current track, make any changes and execute a coordinated transition into any new track. as such, guidance on when cms will complete its assessment of all acos regarding their categorization as low-revenue or high-revenue and disseminate its assessments will be important so providers have enough time to determine which track they may be required to join for the upcoming performance year.\n\n in addition, providing more detailed processes governing the designation of aco categories will help to protect against the potential for aco gaming whereby acos use creative business organization strategies to ensure that they are able to remain in the low-revenue designation.\n\n issue: additional flexibility provided through waivers for enhanced track participants\n cms proposed to extend the use of existing aco waivers to further promote participation in the two- sided, performance-based risk models. the proposed waiver extensions are aimed at giving risk-bearing enhanced track acos, which already have an incentive to reduce wasteful spending and over- utilization, additional flexibility with respect to certain medicare payment and program requirements associated with inpatient skilled nursing facility (\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3snf\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5) care and telehealth services. specifically, cms proposes to expand use of the snf three-day rule waiver to all eligible acos regardless of beneficiary assignment approach and to allow for payment for telehealth services in non-rural areas and, in some cases, at home.\n\n recommendation:\n\n bcbsa supports this approach and we recommend that cms extend the waivers discussed in the proposed rule equally to all aco participants that accept double-sided risk and make all waivers publicly available.\n\n rationale:\n\n cmsq\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal is a definite step in the right direction that would grant acos additional flexibility (waivers)\n to provide benefits and services beyond medicare\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s current rules. however, these standards should be applied consistently across all acos that assume double-sided risk to avoid risk selection and steerage issues. transparency through public reporting and oversight can be another check to prevent aco participants from misusing any waivers approved by cms.\n\n\nc. beneficiary engagement tools\n\n issue: beneficiary incentives\n cms proposes to allow acos under a subset of two-sided risk models to provide incentive payments to patients to encourage them to obtain medically necessary primary care services.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 8 of 13\n\n\n recommendation:\n\n bcbsa supports the guardrails cms has previously established for aco beneficiary incentives as well as applying them to the new incentives allowable per the balanced budget act of 2018. in addition, bcbsa recommends that cms establish requirements that acos release public notifications of their beneficiary incentive programs.\n\n rationale:\n\n incentive payments can work to affect appropriate use of items like preventive services, completion of medication management reviews and health risk assessments, but they should not be allowed to steer enrollment. this could lead to adverse incentives in the market, creating risk pool imbalances and impairing the stability of the program if some acos are acting in bad faith and inappropriately steering healthy beneficiaries to their organizations or sicker beneficiaries away. instituting transparency requirements would provide an additional check on acos to encourage appropriate use of incentive programs.\n\n issue: benchmark methodology\n cms proposes to update the regional factor adjustment, which is currently applied to an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s historical benchmark after its first agreement period. the current adjustment is a percentage of the difference between an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s regional ffs expenditures and its own historical expenditures, with a gradual phase- in to 70 percent of regional expenditures. however, to improve program sustainability and the accuracy of benchmark calculations, cms proposes to incorporate regional expenditures into aco benchmarking methodology for all acos in their first agreement period starting july 1, 2019, and in future years.\n\n recommendation:\n\n bcbsa supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to incorporate regional expenditures into aco benchmarking methodology for all acos in their first agreement period.\n\n rationale:\n\n incorporating regional expenditures into aco benchmarking methodology for all acos in their first agreement would create a more accurate and fairer benchmark for acos. given geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic variations across the country, a national benchmark can have the unintended consequences of both holding some acos to overly high standard and other acos to a lower level of achievement given the populations they serve.\n\n issue: beneficiary opt-in based assignment methodology\n cms is soliciting comments on a beneficiary opt-in assignment option, specifically the process issues underlying a potential methodology. cms indicates acos would be responsible for beneficiary notification, collecting opt-in data, and reporting to cms. cms notes that the mssp opt-in process could borrow elements from ma, but that the timelines and processes would need to be distinct to prevent beneficiary confusion.\n\n recommendation:\n\n we agree with cms that an opt-in option for beneficiaries is redundant with the voluntary provider alignment option beneficiaries have already and which is proposed to expand under this rule. we\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 9 of 13\n\n\n recommend cms continue to enhance the voluntary provider alignment option as proposed under this rule rather than implementing an opt-in methodology at this time.\n\n rationale:\n\n the concept of beneficiary opt-in is appealing and, ultimately, the long-term success of any value-based care model will depend on the willingness of the beneficiaries to choose their providers and be equal partners in their care. however, as cms articulates in the proposed rule, beneficiaries already have the option to choose a primary clinician and subsequently \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3opt-in\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 to the aco in which the clinician participates. this approach maintains the connection between assignment and utilization of primary care services as reinforced by comparing beneficiaries\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 voluntary alignment choices with what their alignment would have been under the claims-based methodology. per cms analysis, use of this approach to date has resulted in 92 percent of the beneficiaries who voluntarily aligned already being assigned to the same aco under the claims-based assignment algorithm. under the expanded definition of \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3primary clinician\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 proposed in this rule, it is reasonable to assume this percentage will move closer to 100 percent.\n\n furthermore, creation of a new process for beneficiary enrollment could, as cms notes, lead to beneficiary confusion between the differences of acos under mssp and ma plans. while we commend cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 thoughtfulness in how to leverage ma best practices to protect beneficiaries and help ensure acos act thoughtfully and appropriately under an opt-in methodology, the close alignment to ma plan practices emphasizes the risks of creating a potentially duplicative system of enrollment and adding unnecessary complexity to the medicare program, both administratively for cms and for beneficiaries.\n\n finally, such a methodology raises important additional questions not yet addressed by cms on how such an approach would work, including:\n\n e what type of education and outreach would be necessary to ensure that beneficiaries understand what they are selecting?\n\n e what are the implications for acos and beneficiaries should they choose to opt-out of an aco?\n\n e would the possibility of opt-in allow for acos to create innovative benefit designs to encourage participation in value-based care models?\n\n issue: broader beneficiary choice of their \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3primary clinician\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5\n cms proposes to allow beneficiaries to designate any aco professional regardless of specialty as their primary clinician responsible for managing overall care.\n\n recommendation:\n\n we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 expansion of aco professionals that beneficiaries can designate as their primary clinician to all specialties, but would encourage the selection of a primary care provider overall, such as an internist or family practitioner.\n\n rationale:\n\n as articulated above, in regards to a beneficiary opt-in methodology, expanding \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3primary clinicians\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 to include all specialties is a meaningful and reasonable approach to increasing beneficiary enrollment choice. this approach maintains the connection between assignment and utilization of services, will likely result in more ffs beneficiaries enrolling into acos, and will prevent confusion between acos and ma plans.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 10 of 13\n\n\n however, this change has the potential to dilute the importance of preventive services, care coordination and case management as specialists may be more focused on care specific to their specialty areas. for\n example, an oncologist as a primary care provider for an aco member would not necessarily be focused on performance measures that relate to preventive services. it will be important for cms and acos to be mindful of that potential, so they can mitigate against any adverse outcomes that arise.\n\n\nd. updating program policies\n\n issue: aco quality measures targeting appropriate opioid use\n cms is seeking comments on approaches to developing the program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s quality measures set in response to the meaningful measures initiative and to support addressing opioid utilization within the ffs population, including additional aggregate data that could be useful or quality measures that could be used to assess factors related to opioid utilization.\n\n recommendation:\n\n bcbsa supports adding opioids-related measures targeted to factors related to opioid utilization. to align with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposals for measurement under the merit-based incentive payment system (mips), we propose that cms implement the prescription drug monitoring program (pdmp) query measure proposed for mips if implemented.\n\n rationale:\n\n the opioid crisis continues to grow, with the centers for disease control and prevention estimating 115 americans die each day from opioid-related overdose. it is a complicated problem where more and better data are needed and where all parties need to be encouraged to improve. bcbsa agrees that promoting the measurement of opioid use and overuse, risks, monitoring and education through quality reporting is an important step to understanding and addressing the opioid crisis. all parties can benefit from more insight into the quality of services being provided.\n\n specific to the pdmp query measure, the centers for disease control and prevention recommends the checking of pdmps as an important step to improve opioid prescribing practices by allowing clinicians to:\n\n e identify patients who may be overusing or misusing opioids by obtaining prescriptions from multiple clinicians\n e better understand a patient\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s daily morphine equivalent dose\n e identify patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 other prescriptions and screen for other substances that may increase a patient\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s risk\n since most states have implemented pdmps at this time, and we encourage the use of these tools, the pdmp query measure is a reasonable step to improve and measure quality in opioid prescribing.\n\n issue: aco certified electronic health record technolo cehrt) usage requirements\n cms is seeking comments on the proposed cehrt usage changes and their start date, as well as whether all acos (not just those in advanced apm tracks) should be required to meet a cehrt standard greater than 50 percent. cms also solicits comments about removing measure aco-11 from the shared savings program and removing the separate aco penalty/reward criterion regarding cehrt use.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 11 of 13\n\n\n recommendation #1:\n\n bcbsa supports the changes proposed by cms to require acos to certify that at least 50 percent of the eligible clinicians participating in the aco use cehrt to document and communicate clinical care to their patients and other healthcare providers.\n\n rationale #1:\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 decision to standardize the reporting requirements for promoting interoperability helps achieve the goal of reducing the regulatory reporting burden across the federal payment programs. promoting interoperability is a systemwide goal, and while the specific quality measures themselves may change across clinical specialties and within payment models, the overall goal of achieving a top-line percentage of cehrt usage within the reporting entity should, and can, be a common goal.\n\n recommendation #2:\n we support the decision to remove aco-11 as a duplicative reporting requirement.\n rationale #2:\n\n we support the reduction in duplicative reporting burdens and agree that discontinuing the use of the aco-11 will improve alignment with the requirements of the quality payment program.\n\n recommendation #3:\n\n bcbsa recommends that the communication definition be expanded to include the communication of clinical information with payers as necessary to address payment and care coordination issues.\n\n rationale #3:\n\n bcbsa agrees that interoperability must be promoted by the expansion of the use of cehrt by physicians in acos, apms and other value-based payment models both in government programs and commercial markets. however, interoperability does not stop with the exchange of clinical data among providers, but must also extend to making the clinical information accessible and meaningful to the patients and accessible and supportive in pursuit of the efficiency and quality care goals in those value- based payment models. therefore, we support the availability and integration of clinical and administrative data as a goal for cehrt.\n\n issue: coordination of pharmacy care for ffs beneficiaries\n cms seeks comment on how medicare acos and part d sponsors could work together and be encouraged to improve the coordination of pharmacy care for ffs beneficiaries.\n\n recommendation:\n\n we recommend that cms promote ways to leverage acos in ma, such as greater flexibility in network design, to encourage more value-based contracting between these high-performing networks and ma plans.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 12 of 13\n\n\n rationale:\n\n this would increase opportunities for acos and ma plans to work together and drive improvements in quality. the more cms can allow for opportunities for acos and ma plans to work together, the more we move the needle to improve medicare overall.\n\n issue: innovative business arrangements to reward plan sponsors for beneficiary outcomes within pharmacy care coordination\n cms seeks comments on ways to support innovative business arrangements to financially reward plan sponsors for related better beneficiary outcomes.\n\n recommendation #1:\n\n currently, there is sharing of part d data with acos, however, these data flows could be improved by putting in standards for acos that are more aligned with ma prescription drug plans (ma-pds) that would encourage better outcomes, such as medication management reviews on their assigned beneficiaries, particularly for opioids and other substances prone to abuse.\n\n rationale #1:\n\n receiving more actionable part d data would complement aco medical data, helping acos to have the complete picture of, and better coordinate, a beneficiary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s care. to help ensure this data is used to lead to better outcomes, acos should be expected to use medical management techniques similar to the standards practiced in ma-pd. medical management is an important tool to promote safe, effective and low-cost treatment.\n\n recommendation #2:\n\n we recommend cms continue to pursue avenues to modernize patient privacy protections by aligning 42 cfr part 2 with hipaa standards.\n\n rationale #2:\n\n the federal regulations that govern confidentiality of drug and alcohol treatment and prevention records (42 cfr part 2) set requirements limiting the use and disclosure of patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 substance use records from certain substance use programs. patients are required to give multiple consents, creating a barrier for integration and coordination of healthcare. a lack of access to the full scope of medical information for each patient can result in the inability of providers and organizations, including acos and plan sponsors, to deliver safe, high-quality treatment and care coordination. the barriers presented by part 2 can result in the failure to integrate services and can lead to potentially dangerous medical situations for patients.\n modernizing the statutory language would help ensure safe, effective high-quality treatment while protecting the confidentiality of patients living with substance use disorder.\n\n issue: aco partnerships with plan sponsors\n cms requests information about existing aco partnerships with plan sponsors, barriers to partnership formation encountered, and ways for cms to assist in reducing barriers and enabling data-sharing.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 13 of 13\n\n\n recommendation:\n\n bcbsa believes that a major barrier to coordination is the limited interoperability across stakeholders. we recommend the following ways for cms to assist in enabling data-sharing:\n\n e enforce, where possible, but otherwise promote consistent development, implementation and application of standards and certification requirements for all stakeholders in healthcare (e.g., providers, payers, vendors, technology developers)\n\n e leverage industry standards (e.g., hipaa, hl7 fast healthcare information resources) and standards compliance to motivate healthcare entities to participate only in those data-sharing networks that utilize high-value, robust patient records\n e emphasize consumer experience and raise consumer expectations to promote access to a longitudinal patient record that combines administrative and clinical data free of access fees and data blocking challenges\n e collaborate with other government agencies and the private sector in developing specific guidance, policies and regulations that address systemic barriers to interoperability, including how to measure, identify and remediate instances of data blocking to ensure patients have access to their data and other stakeholders have the necessary access to enable the delivery, payment and operations of healthcare\n e encourage the breaking down of data silos that exist in clinical decision-making by improving standardization in how information should be interpreted (e.g., consistent interpretation of results of medical devices aimed at treating the same condition, consistent and robust fields in ehr systems to account for different provider needs) and continuing to encourage the move from paper to electronic health records\n rationale:\n\n the dual challenges of needing greater data standardization and limited information access are compromising the ability to create efficient and effective partnerships between acos and plan sponsors.\n currently, standards exist in varying degrees of maturity and cms is in a unique position to influence the updating of existing and developing new data standards. this critical function can help to create a common framework in the operations, policy, standards, and technology areas underlying these data exchanges, a significant step to addressing these barriers and improving coordination.\n\n we appreciate your consideration of our comments on the proposed rule for acos and thank you for considering our comments. we look forward to continuing to work with cms on the mssp and other aco programs, particularly since bcbs plans are such active participants in advancing value-based care arrangements. if you have questions, please contact anshu choudhri at 202.626.8606 or anshuman.choudhri@bcbsa.com.\n\n sincerely,\n 2 kris haltmeyer\n vice president, legislative and regulatory policy

organizations\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6pathways to success proposed rule\n dear administrator verma:\n\n on behalf of the physician and medical student members of the american medical association (ama), i am pleased to offer our comments to the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) regarding the medicare shared savings program (mssp) pathways to success proposed rule. the ama is encouraged by several proposed policies aimed at improving the opportunities for accountable care organizations (acos) to succeed, but also recommends some significant changes. our key comments may be summarized as follows:\n\n e weare pleased that cms proposes to extend aco agreement periods to five years, as this will improve stability and predictability for aco participants. studies of physician experience with payment models have found that constant changes in payment policies and requirements are extremely disruptive to practices.\n\n e as the ama has recommended, cms proposes to better account for changes in aco patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 health status over time. we support the proposal to treat newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries the same way for purposes of risk adjustment. we also encourage cms to consider modifying its policy in the final rule to include adjustments to aco baseline scores, not just benchmarks, as many conditions that may be newly documented when patients are assigned to an aco are not new diagnoses for the patient, and to eliminate the proposed limit of three percent in the amount that risk scores may change during a five-year agreement.\n\n e the ama agrees with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to integrate the track 1+ model into the mssp. the ama joined with the national association of acos (naacos) and other organizations in proposing to cms that the track 1+ model be created following enactment of the medicare access and chip reauthorization act (macra) and we are glad that cms views it as a positive addition to the aco program.\n\n ama plaza | 330 n. wabash ave. | suite 39300 | chicago, il 60611-5885\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 2\n e the ama appreciates that cms is seeking to better define acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 accountability to match their capabilities, as we have long recommended. although we continue to strongly support allowing acos and other alternative payment models (apms) to set risk requirements at a percentage of revenues instead of benchmark spending, we recommend an alternative approach for establishing shared savings and risk requirements based on the aco participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 ability to control key aspects of spending, instead of the proposed low- or high-revenue designations.\n\n e we urge cms to retain the track 1 model, potentially with modifications to encourage greater savings, instead of forcing all acos into two-sided risk models.\n\n e the ama recommends that additional upfront payments for services be made available to physicians participating in acos, beyond those currently available under the medicare physician fee schedule.\n\n e instead of focusing on opioid dosage, quality measurement should focus on promotion of preventive strategies such as screening and treatment for substance use, as well as the quality of pain care. the ama is actively working to reverse the opioid epidemic, and agrees that performance measurement may be one avenue for tracking progress and improving management of patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 pain and substance use disorders; however, the ama has several concerns with the opioid-related measures that cms has proposed for use within the mssp.\n\n e the ama agrees with naacos and other stakeholders that the proposed sharing rates for new acos are too low and will hurt the business case for organizations contemplating participation. surveys conducted by naacos have demonstrated that acos incur very significant start-up costs. even under current mssp policies, it is difficult for many acos to recover their initial investments, and a reduced sharing rate will make this even more difficult.\n\n e the ama supports the proposed flexibilities for acos to choose between prospective and retrospective assignment methods, and the expanded definition of primary care services to be used in claims-based assignment. we agree with naacos that the current voluntary alignment process has been underutilized and that cms should explore policies to improve this process, such as allowing patients to make their designation by calling 1-800-medicare, instead of adopting a new opt-in process focused on patients choosing acos instead of choosing their primary physician.\n\n e the ama appreciates the policy proposals regarding waivers of the skilled nursing facility three-day inpatient stay rule and certain telehealth rules. acos in the shared savings-only model have generated more savings for medicare than those in two-sided models. accordingly, the ama recommends that the policy waivers available to acos that take downside financial risk also be available to acos in the shared savings-only model. these waivers help acos to better manage the delivery of patient care and are as likely to improve care for patients assigned to shared savings acos as they are to improve care for patients assigned to two-sided acos.\n\n e the ama strongly recommends that aco payment incentives under the merit-based incentive payment system (mips) be excluded from aco expenditures for purposes of comparing benchmark to actual spending and calculating each aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s savings and losses.\n this policy unfairly punishes high-performing acos that do not meet advanced apm criteria by\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 3\n requiring them to participate in mips but then counting their mips payment incentives against them. it would have the perverse result of linking better mips scores to reduced likelihood of earning shared savings. cms currently excludes advanced apm bonuses from aco expenditures and it should do the same for mips incentive payments.\n\n e the ama has concerns with the proposal allowing cms to exercise the option to terminate an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participation agreement early if the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s expenditures exceed its benchmark by a certain amount. by potentially terminating acos before they have several years of meaningful performance data available, this provision may have the unintended consequence of removing well-intentioned acos from the program which may go on to achieve savings and make quality improvements in later years.\n\n e the ama encourages cms to allow individual physicians and subsets of physicians within a practice that has a single taxpayer identification number to align themselves with acos as participants. it should not be necessary for all the physicians within a group practice to participate in an aco because one or more members of the group wish to participate in the aco.\n a taxpayer identification number for a medical group is basically a means of billing medicare for claims under the fee-for-service system; physicians should have greater flexibility in how they organize themselves for delivering care within acos and other apms.\n\n the remainder of this letter provides a more detailed explanation for several of our key recommended changes in the proposed rule.\n\n the track 1 aco model should be retained\n under the proposed rule, all acos would be required to move into a two-sided risk model. this proposal should not be finalized. the track 1 model should be retained for four reasons:\n\n e many acos have demonstrated that they can reduce medicare spending without accepting downside risk, and in 2017, track 1 acos achieved greater savings than acos with downside risk in tracks 2 and 3.\n\n e the methodology used by cms can unfairly penalize acos for increases in spending that aco participants cannot control.\n\n e many physicians are using their track 1 participation as a means of participating in the quality payment program.\n\n e cms does not have statutory authority to retire the shared savings-only model and replace it with the basic and enhanced tracks.\n\n acos can achieve savings for medicare without downside risk\n in every year since the mssp was first created, the majority of track 1 acos have reduced medicare spending relative to cms benchmarks without being subject to downside risk. in 2017, the savings produced by the track 1 acos that reduced spending were large enough to offset the increase in spending for those that did not generate savings as well as the shared savings payments to those who did.\n\n the premise underlying the proposed policies is that acos with downside risk achieve greater savings than those with upside-only risk, but the exact opposite was true in 2017\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6the 433 track 1 acos saved\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 4\n an average of $37 per beneficiary, 36 percent more per beneficiary than the track 2 and 3 acos. because there were so many more track 1 acos, the total net savings they generated for medicare ($290 million)\n was more than 12 times the net savings generated by the track 2 and 3 acos ($23 million). based on the experience to date, terminating the track 1 program could increase medicare spending rather than increasing savings.\n\n the benchmarking methodology can unfairly penalize acos\n cms indicates that it is continuing to refine its aco benchmarking methodology. for example, the risk adjustment methodology used to date has failed to account for patient characteristics and changes in those characteristics that can result in the need for more services or more expensive services, which has unfairly penalized acos that have more of these patients. although the current proposal would allow acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 risk scores to change over time, the risk adjustment methodology still does not account for important factors in patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 health care needs, such as functional status and severity or stage of illness.\n\n cms has included some changes to the benchmarking methodology in the proposed rule, such as modifying the use of regional vs. national data and allowing changes in patient health status to be more fully recognized in the risk adjustment system, but there is no evidence yet as to how effective these changes will be, nor does cms propose adjustments for aspects of spending that aco providers cannot control, such as part b drug costs. requiring acos to accept downside risk based on a flawed methodology could penalize them financially for delivering the services their patients need.\n\n track 1 offers a better way to measure and reward quality for many physicians\n cms has recognized physician participation in a track 1 aco as a mips apm. in section 1899(b)(3)(d), congress specifically authorized cms to \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3use alternative criteria than would otherwise apply\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 under the mips program for making payments to acos. many physicians have found that using aco quality measures and reporting on other mips elements through the aco is a more efficient and effective way of measuring and improving the quality of care than is possible through the standard mips program. cms has reported that acos have significantly improved the quality of care for medicare patients, so even if a track 1 aco has not reduced medicare spending, it may well have improved the quality of care for medicare patients and enabled participating physicians to manage quality reporting more efficiently. terminating the track 1 option could therefore have negative impacts on both medicare patients and their physicians.\n\n cms cannot substitute the basic and enhanced tracks for the shared savings-only model\n what cms refers to as \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3track 1\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 is the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3shared savings program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 that was established by section 1899(d)\n of the social security act. under this statutory authority, \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3acos that meet quality performance standards established by the secretary are eligible to receive payment for shared savings.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 although congress also provides the option for cms to use \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3partial capitation\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 or \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3other payment models\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 rather than shared savings to make payments to acos, it is not clear that section 1899 allows cms to replace track 1 entirely with the basic and enhanced tracks.\n\n section iv.e of the proposed rule (83 fr 41927) states that the proposed requirements for downside risk and other changes rely on the authority granted in section 1899(1)(3), but it incorrectly states that section 1899(i)(3)(b) \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3requires that such other payment model must not result in additional program\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 5\n expenditures.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 what this section actually says is that \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3payments to an aco for items and services...for beneficiaries for a year...shall be established in a manner that does not result in spending more for such aco for such beneficiaries than would otherwise be expended for such aco for such year if the model were not implemented.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 in other words, the statute is not referring to a measure of overall program spending, but to the change in spending for each aco.\n\n the current track 1 model meets the statutory requirements for shared savings payments under section 1899(d). section 1899(i) permits cms to use payment models that meet the requirements for partial capitation or other payment models instead of the shared savings approach.' however, one of the requirements for both of these other payment models is that spending cannot be more for such an aco than would otherwise be expended for such aco if the model were not implemented.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 in the proposed basic and enhanced tracks, if medicare spending exceeds an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark, the aco would be required to repay a portion of the difference but not the full amount. because the aco would not be required to repay the full increase, medicare would spend more for that aco than it would otherwise have spent and this does not satisfy the statutory requirement in section 1899(1).\n\n clearly, modifying the proposed basic and enhanced track models to require that each aco repay any spending above its benchmark in full would be an undesirable policy and unattractive to potential applicants, so cms cannot use its proposed downside risk models to completely replace the shared- savings only model. moreover, we believe congress clearly intended to allow acos to participate in a shared savings-only model. consequently, the ama recommends that cms retain track 1, with potential modifications to improve the model and increase the savings for medicare, as described below. cms could use other statutory authorities to implement the other models included in the basic and enhanced tracks, in addition to retaining track 1, similarly to how the track 1+ and next generation aco models were established.\n\n modify rather than retire track 1\n requiring acos to accept downside risk is not the only approach that cms could use to increase net savings to the medicare program from the mssp. for example, one policy expert identified several different options for increasing mssp savings, including:*\n e drop acos from the program if they have not achieved savings after several years;\n e reduce shared savings payments to acos that incur large losses before generating savings; and\n e allow acos to take accountability for the specific types of spending they can control, rather than total medicare spending.\n\n the information provided in section iv.d of the proposed rule (83 fr 41926-27) does not indicate that these or other options were considered. we recommend that cms analyze these and other approaches and develop a comparative analysis of their advantages and disadvantages in lieu of retiring track 1.\n\n\n\n ' social security act \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 1899(i)(1).\n\n ? social security act \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 1899(i)(2)(b) & (3)(b).\n\n

cms for recognizing that acos differ significantly in their ability to accept financial risk and for including limits on downside risk based on a percentage of the aco participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 revenue, not just a percentage of medicare spending. this is consistent with the approach that the ama recommended and cms adopted in its regulations defining advanced apms.\n\n we also commend cms for recognizing that aco participants differ in their ability to influence or control total medicare spending, and that adjustments in financial rewards and penalties are needed based on those differences. we do not believe the proposed distinction between \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3low revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 and \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3high revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 acos is an appropriate or effective way of making those adjustments.\n\n it is true that if 90-100 percent of medicare spending on the beneficiaries assigned to an aco represents services delivered by the aco participants, they will be in a better position to control spending than participants in an aco where only 10-20 percent of the spending is associated with the participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 services. however, one cannot conclude that an aco that delivers services representing 30 percent of total spending has significantly greater control over the total than an aco that only delivers services representing 20 percent of spending. neither aco delivers a majority of the services that are driving spending, and the difference in proportion could be entirely due to characteristics of the patients who are assigned to the aco, not to any difference in factors that the aco participants can control.\n\n for example, a physician-led aco whose assigned beneficiaries are younger and less frail is likely to have lower levels of spending on hospitalizations and post-acute care than other acos, and therefore the physicians\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 revenue will represent a higher share of total spending in the aco. this would not indicate that the physicians have a greater ability to control spending or to accept risk than physicians in other acos; indeed, the exact opposite may be true, because the primary way many acos have achieved savings has been through reducing the use of expensive post-acute care services. another example would be that aco participants who administer expensive infused medications in their offices may have revenues representing a higher share of total spending than in acos organized by physicians who do not administer infused drugs. the first set of physicians cannot better control drug prices or pay penalties to medicare if drug prices increase faster than cms benchmarks than the second aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s physicians.\n\n the proposed rule states that the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3low revenue/high revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 distinction is intended to measure differences in the ability of the aco to control total spending, but the discussion suggests that the real goal is to identify which aco participants have more financial resources and are less likely to be bankrupted by repaying losses to cms. we are concerned that the proposed rule is so narrowly focused on \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3risk\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 that it overlooks the original intent of the aco program to enable physicians and other health care providers to deliver patient care in better and more affordable ways.\n\n to actually \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3measure the degree of control that acos have over total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for their assigned beneficiaries,\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 as stated in the regulation, the ama recommends that cms do so directly instead of using problematic proxies such as the proportion of revenues. this could be done by dividing services or spending into several categories reflecting the relative levels of control that aco participants would be expected to have over services, and then assigning different savings thresholds and sharing levels to each. for example, spending could be divided into the following categories, reflecting decreasing levels of control by the aco participants:\n\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018\n page 7 e services delivered by the aco participants; e services ordered by the aco participants; e potentially avoidable complications of services delivered or ordered by the aco participants; and e all other services.\n\n under this approach, if a large share of the spending on an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s assigned patients is associated with services that are delivered or ordered by the aco participants, or with potentially avoidable complications of those services, that aco would be in a much better position to control total spending than in an aco where most of the services are being delivered or ordered by other providers. both acos could be held accountable for the spending on the services their participants can control, while avoiding penalizing them for decisions made by other providers that the patients have chosen to use.\n\n this approach is consistent with the one payment option congress authorized in section 1899 that cms has not implemented\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3partial capitation model.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 in section 1899(i)(2), congress specifically gave cms the authority to place an aco \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3at financial risk for some, but not all, of the items and services covered under parts a and b, such as at risk for some or all physicians\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 services or all items and services under part b.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 many physician groups have experience with using this approach in commercial insurance and medicare advantage plans.\n\n allow additional upfront payments to aco participants for patient services\n we were pleased that cms acknowledged in section iv.c.1.a.(2) (83 fr 41919) that acos must make significant upfront investments in enhanced services and care management infrastructure that can only be recovered through shared savings payments. as the ama has pointed out repeatedly in its comments to cms on apms, one of the biggest barriers physicians face in delivering higher-value care is that there is no payment at all in the medicare physician fee schedule (or inadequate payment) for many high-value services, such as development of treatment plans and employment of nurse care managers. in addition, if participants in the aco reduce the use of current billable services and substitute unbillable services, they will lose revenues in the short run and may not be able to wait until cms makes a shared savings payment to recoup those losses.\n\n for acos to reduce medicare spending without harming quality of care for patients, participating physicians need to be paid appropriately for delivering the right mix of services to patients, not just receive a financial bonus when fewer services are delivered. moreover, if an aco is going to be accountable for total medicare spending, the aco participants should have the flexibility to be paid upfront for the services they need to deliver in order to reduce spending and improve quality.\n\n ideally, each physician in an aco would be able to participate in one or more apms specifically designed to support high-value care for the types of patients they treat. unfortunately, cms has only implemented a small number of physician-focused apms, and most physicians do not have the opportunity to use an apm to improve care delivery. until more primary and specialty care apms are available, it is essential that the mssp provide the opportunity for physicians participating in an aco to be paid differently. cms did provide additional resources to some acos through the advanced payment aco model and the aco investment model, but these programs are no longer available to new applicants. the proposed expansion of telehealth services will likely be very helpful to acos, but this will address only one aspect of services that are currently undercompensated.\n\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 8\n we recommend that cms create a mechanism whereby physicians in acos can receive upfront payments to support services that are currently not paid for under standard medicare payment systems.\n physicians in the aco would identify what types of payments they need based on the specific ways they plan to change the delivery of patient care. accountability for spending on these payments could be achieved in two different ways, depending on the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s overall accountability for spending:\n\n e track 1 acos would be responsible for repaying all or part of the upfront payments they receive if specific aspects of utilization or spending were not reduced. this is similar to the approach that cms is currently using in the comprehensive primary care plus model.\n\n e for acos in two-sided models, the upfront payments would be counted toward the overall spending for which the aco is accountable, so if the additional payments do not result in more than offsetting savings, the aco would be required to pay back cms some or all of what they received. this is similar to the approach cms has defined in the downside risk track of the oncology care model.\n\n quality measures related to use of opioids\n the ama is actively working to reverse the opioid epidemic, particularly through the activities of the ama opioid task force, which was formed in 2014 and includes 26 national medical specialty and state medical associations, the american osteopathic association, and the american dental association.\n performance measurement may be one avenue by which we can track progress and make improvements to reduce the opioid epidemic. the ama supports every effort underway to meet this need. however, we have concerns with the opioid related measures cms proposes for use within the mssp. quality measurement needs to focus on utilization of preventive strategies such as screening and treatment for substance use, as well as pain management, i.e., how well patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 pain is controlled, whether functional improvement goals are met, and what therapies are being used to manage pain. if aco patients are receiving appropriate care for substance use disorders and if their pain can be well-controlled and function improved without the need for high doses of opioids over a long period of time, those may be indicators of good patient care, but a reduction in opioid dose alone is not an appropriate goal.\n\n e nof #2940: use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer\n as the ama has highlighted in our 2019 physician fee schedule proposed rule comments, the ama does not agree with the fundamental premise of a measure that focuses only on daily dose and duration of therapy involving prescription opioid analgesics because on its own it is not a good indication of quality patient care. in fact, since the centers for disease control & prevention (cdc) guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain was issued, there have been many reports of patients who have been successfully managed on opioid analgesics for long periods of time being forced to abruptly reduce or discontinue their medication regimens with sometimes extremely adverse outcomes, including depression, loss of function, and even suicide. there has been considerable discussion of these unintended consequences at meetings of the hhs interagency pain management best practices task force.\n\n identifying those patients for whom daily morphine milligram equivalents (mme) prescribed are considered high may serve as an indicator of whether a patient is at risk of overdose and should be co-\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 9\n prescribed naloxone, but it is not a mark of higher quality care. the cdc recommendations? allow physicians to document a clinical rationale or justification when suggested dose levels are exceeded; yet, the existing measures that focus on mme do not capture if a justification exists nor do they provide a well-defined and targeted denominator.\n\n we are also concerned with the feasibility of directly calculating the measure from the electronic health record (ehr). the electronic clinical quality measure (ecqm) is reliant on a function that is not consistently supported by ehr vendors, and participation with the measure would require additional costs or vendor fees placed on the aco. it is our understanding that the ehr does not uniformly capture mmes and this calculation would be necessary to populate the measure\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s numerator. there are also internet, ios and android-based apps that perform this functionality, but to use them the aco would need to manually enter patient information and calculate the mme, introducing the possibility for human error. in addition, terminology and code mappings play a big role in how well an ehr-based calculator works, but due to the lack of consistency and standardized code mappings the results produced are not very reliable. many physicians are not yet able to electronically prescribe controlled substances, and those that can do not have seamless integration between their controlled substance e-prescribing and ehr systems, which would present additional problems in capturing the needed ecqm information.\n\n if cms implements a measure that focuses on mme it must adequately define the patients for whom higher doses of opioids may be appropriate. otherwise, the measure may provide invalid representations of physician performance and cms would be sending a signal to physicians that the government does not think physicians should prescribe these medications, and substituting its judgement about the risk-benefit tradeoff for those of physicians. therefore, cms should consider and explore alternative measures or ones that provide complementary information on the quality of care in managing substance use disorders and/or pain, for example, nof #2597 for assessing substance use screening and intervention.\n\n e nof #2950. use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer\n the ama has concerns with the proposed inclusion of \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 (nqf #2950) in the mssp as it was developed with the intention of determining the quality of care provided by prescription drug health plans and not for acos. the measure as currently specified requires health plan medical and pharmacy claims and member enrollment information and the data may not be readily available across all acos given their varying composition and access to pharmacy claims data. comprehensive assessment of the feasibility of collecting and reporting these data at the aco level must be determined. for example, for those mssp participants that provide care across state lines or have patients that receive care from others outside of the aco, it is unclear whether they can access data to ensure that prescriptions were not received outside of the network. ensuring that acos can collect the data needed to satisfy the measure requirements will inform and allow thorough evaluations of the reliability and the validity of the performance scores. for example, it is not clear what minimum sample sizes are needed to ensure that performance scores could be considered reliable across acos. the testing completed by the pharmacy quality alliance included more than 700 medicare part d prescription drug plans, eight state-based medicaid prescription drug plans, and one commercial health plan. the ama believes that this measure must be adequately specified and tested across acos prior to its implementation in mssp.\n\n\n\n 4 centers for disease control & prevention. guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain. 2016. available at:\n https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 10\n e nof #2951: use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer\n the ama has the same concerns with the proposed inclusion of \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 (nqf #2951), given the dearth of information on the feasibility of collecting and reporting pharmacy claims data and the lack of specifications and testing for the intended level of analysis. in addition, on review of the performance scores provided during the nqf endorsement review, we question whether this measure has adequate variation in scores to enable meaningful comparisons in performance since the testing results showed that there was less than 2.5 percent difference between the minimum and maximum rates for the medicare population and less than\n5.5 percent for the medicaid population. if similar rates will be found when applied to acos, we believe\n that it will be difficult to distinguish better versus worse care and it also must be adequately specified and tested across acos prior to its implementation in mssp.\n\n conclusion the ama appreciates the opportunity to provide our comments and thanks cms for considering our\n views.

health and human services attention: cms-1701-p\n\np.o. box 8013\n\n baltimore, maryland 21244-8013\n dear centers for medicare and medicaid services,\n signature partners appreciates this opportunity to submit comments in response to the medicare shared savings program (mssp) notice of proposed rulemaking (cms- 1701-p). signature partners has participated in the program since 2015 and currently has two accountable care organizations, signature partners in health and signature network. our acos have had significant impacts on the quality of care provided to medicare beneficiaries and we will continue to emphasize the importance of quality care in the years to come.\n\n signature partners has developed comments regarding the proposed rule, which are included below. we hope that you will consider our input as you make the final decision regarding the future of the program.\n\n\n1. shared savings rate: the proposed rule lowers the shared savings rate for acos\n with no downside risk from 50% to 25%. this will deter participation.\n therefore, we suggest maintaining a 50% shared savings rate for acos in levels a and b of the basic track. this will incentivize new acos to join the program while maintaining participation of renewing acos that have a preference for having little to no downside risk.\n\n the proposed shared savings rate is a significant decrease for existing acos like signature partners which means less investment in population management and care coordination.\n\n in addition, reducing the shared savings rate will result in challenges with provider buy-in. provider buy-in has been crucial to the success of our acos as our physicians value the program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s emphasis on quality of care as a result of collaborative efforts across practices.\n\n\n2. distinction between high and low-revenue acos: the proposed rule calculates\n loss sharing limits according to whether acos are low- revenue or high - revenue. the loss sharing limits in the proposed rule are structured in a manner that forces acos with hospital participants such as ours to take on more risk due to being deemed as high-revenue acos. we believe that there should be a level playing field for all acos as this distinction would discourage acos from\n 3190 fairview park drive, suite 900 - falls church, va 22042 7855,744.6895 f703.207,7063 signaturepartners.org\n signature\n\n\n recruiting hospital participants. we ieee geauct inova health system which is northern virginia\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s largest health system and this distinction would counter our tireless efforts to encourage various providers throughout our network to coordinate care.\n\n the proposed rule also states that high-revenue acos would be required to advance to the enhanced track after one year in basic level e as opposed to low-revenue acos that would be permitted a second agreement period in basic level e. again, this promotes inequity within the program and we believe that by removing the distinction between high and low-revenue acos, all acos would have the opportunity to move into risk in a manner that is most appropriate for them.\n\n\n3. beneficiary attribution methodology: beneficiaries within the attributed\n population may have a low number of member months for various reasons that are beyond the control of the aco. for example, our acos bear the full costs for beneficiaries that are attributed to primary care providers in our acos but live out of state for half of the year. we have no control over the services these beneficiaries receive in other states and it is difficult to manage their care.\n therefore, cms should consider a mechanism to account for such challenges in the assignment of the attributed population to avoid negatively affecting an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s financial and quality performance.\n\n\n4. promoting interoperability (pi): we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to remove aco\n measure 11 (percent of primary care physicians who successfully meet meaningful use requirements) and rely on attestation to evaluate the use of certified electronic health record technology (cehrt). this will significantly reduce the reporting burden on providers at our various practices.\n however, we urge cms to clarify how this will affect the scoring for the merit- based incentive payment system (mips) and whether acos would be required to report for the pi category or if weights for the pi category would be redistributed equally to the quality and improvement activities categories.\n\n if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us using the information provided below. we appreciate your support and guidance during our participation in the program.\n\n sincerely,\n nnifer oppong program manager, mssp signature partners/inova health system jennifer. oppong2 @inova.org 703-914-2905\n\n\n\n\n rive,

baltimore, md 21244 re: comment on the \"medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pathways to success\" (\"pathways to success\") as published in the federal register on august 17, 2018. dear ms. verma on behalf of memorial hermann health system and the memorial hermann accountable care organization (\"mhaco\"), we are submitting the following comments to the pathways to success proposed rule. as a participant in the medicare shared savings program (\"mssp\") since 2012, mhaco has been a leader in obtaining share savings for cms. we are very interested in continuing to have success in this program, and would like to offer the following comments with respect to the proposed rule.\n1. e&m reimbursement: although not specially addressed in the rule, we would like to offer \n the suggestion that the reduction in pay for primary care physicians under cpt code 99214 and 99215 is inconsistent with the goals for pathways to success. by creating a disincentive for primary care physicians to treat complex patients with multiple chronic illnesses, which require more time and documentation,it makes it more difficult to ensure that these patients will be seen and have their care appropriately managed and may increase overall cost attributed to the patient thus adversely affecting the aco and cms.\n2. timing. in lieu of a six month extension to the current mssp period, with a new start date \n of july 1, 2019, we recommend starting the new program on january 1, 2020. this will give current aco participants additional time to evaluate whether we have the appropriate structure in place, implement processes to comply with new regulations, and make necessary changes to our networks. in particular, acos that end december 31, 2018 should be extended for a one year period on the current track.\n3. snf waiver. we recommend that the snf waiver be available for level b in addition to \n page 2 of 3 setting, often at a lower cost, and to tailor personalized care plans where additional hospital days is not necessarily the best option. for this reason, all mssp programs should be able to utilize this waiver.\n4. level for existing acos. we urge cms under the newly proposed rule, to allow aco's \n which have previously participated in track 1 entrance under the basic track at level b. specifically, acos in track 1 should not require to go into level c immediately. this will give those acos the appropriate amount of time to be fully ready for risk-based performance enhancing the probability for success of the program.\n5. mlr. we recommend cms provide a choice of fixed or variable msr/mlr at all levels of \n basic. once programs are further developed, it may become more apparent on which methodology makes the most sense for cms, participants, and beneficiaries, but initially we believe offering the choice provides the best pathway for success within a reasonable structure.\n6. risk adjustment. please consider in your proposed adjustments to the risk adjustment \n methodology aligning with algorithms and processes which sync up with those used for the medicare advantage populations. by creating the ability to compare risk and illness burden for both medicare advantage and mssp populations, acos can tailor programs and education around them without creating unnecessary analytic or documentation burdens for providers while improving the care coordination, disease management and support structure for the patients with resultant improved outcomes and reduced unnecessary cost.\n7. quality measure's. please consider standardizing quality measures and other reportable \n metrics between mssp and medicare advantage and also reducing the number required. many mssp participants will have physicians in both programs, and it would substantially increase time and complexity for physicians and acos to track separate measures. additionally, aligning the specific quality measures for mssp and medicare advantage stars allows acos to tailor programs and education around the mesures, create interoperability in measurement and reporting, and reduces the analytics burden on the aco and their providers. specifically, we request that mssp adopt the medicare advantage stars clinical measures.\n8. beneficiary opt-in. we agree that there are advantages to permit a beneficiary to opt-in \n page 3 of 3\n9. incentive payments.  we are supportive of the proposed incentive payment of up to $20 \n for each assigned beneficiary for each qualifying pcp service, however we would like to see greater detail around what qualifies and how this would be administered.\n10. pcp selection.  we are pleased with the proposed pcp selection criteria which would allow \n a beneficiary to voluntarily designate any aco professional as their primary care provider. however we would caution that this may actually have unintended consequences to the overall goal of the program in the event many choose specialist providers who are unaccustomed to managing populations holistically. \u0000 prevention, screening and coordination of care between multiple specialists is key to care improvement and population health. primary care physicians are trained to practice in this manner whereas many specialists may not be. this would place undue burden on both the patient and the aco to manage care appropriately. in addition we would request greater clarity on the mechanics of how this process would be operationalized for each aco.\n11. risk sharing. cms may consider increasing the level for upside savings in basic tracks. \n\n", "0261": "see attached file(s)\n1. buena vida \n lt,buena vida y salijd (am good life & health ti\n\n", "0263": "dear administrator verma,\r\naugusta care partners is an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our community.\r\nsincerely,\r\nyury yakubchyk, md     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     ", "0265": "the current proposal is to cap risk score benchmark adjustments at +/- 3% from the baseline year 3 (by3) to the performance year (py) and to perform this calculation separately for each category. the current proposal would effectively apply less than a 3% overall benchmark adjustment if any of the four categories have less than a 3% increase. this means that an aco could have well over 3% increase in overall risk but have significantly less than a 3% adjustment allowed.\r\n\r\nwe recommend that the 3% cap on the risk score adjustment be applied combining all eligibility categories instead of being applied at each individual eligibility category. we believe that it is more appropriate to apply the cap at the aggregate level in order to accurately reflect the changing risk and mix of an aco's population. under this method, the overall benchmark adjustment would be +/- 3% of the combined aggregate claims experience before applying the risk adjustment.\r\n\r\nwe also believe the 3% adjustment over a 5-year performance period is too low, especially in the latter years of the agreement. population changes and changes in health status of the population could be dramatic over a five-year time-frame. 3% adjustment over that entire five year period is too low. we recommend increasing the cap in the latter years (py4 and py5) to something higher than 3% and potentially a 1% per year compound growth rate in the latter years based on the final rate in py3 with no overall cap.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     ", "0267": "see attached file(s) cms should modify the

and move to data-driven and evidence-based policy decisions. i applaud cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recognition that there are in fact multiple approaches with very different business models participating in aco programs, each of whom should be handled differently. however, i disagree with the assumption that both models need to be rapidly pushed toward risk. the evidence presented in seema verna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blog post shows that independent physician led acos not taking risk have the best performance, saving $182 million compared to hospital led acos which have actually cost the

(cms-1707-p). the proposed levels of risk are too high and will drive rural providers and hospitals from the mssp. rural hospitals and practices are risk averse for very good reason. operating margins are too small to allow for taking on risk. rural health runs on tight budgets and limited human and capital resources. in addition to the limited, and often negative, operating margins, rural healthcare also cares for a sicker and older medicare population. the proposed rule must create a glide path specifically for rural acos.\r\nthe proposed rule attempts to create a glide path for lower revenue aco participants to take on risk. however, the proposed basic and enhanced tracks require acos to assume levels of risk unrealistic for rural hospitals, practices and independent providers. the mssp aco program is an important model for rural america. most rural acos are a combination of rural entities. it is rare to find a rural aco comprised of only independent practices. the mssp is the only model that includes multiple aspects of the healthcare system, as opposed to other value-based models that only pertain to a single practice or organization. the mssp provides the legal framework to allow rural hospitals and providers to discuss cost and create care initiatives for the entire community while still maintaining their independence.\r\nmany rural aco participants are working to decrease costs on lower than average benchmarks and smaller attributed patient populations. it is very difficult to achieve savings with the high msr smaller acos are assigned. the sicker populations and lower benchmarks mean an increased potential for extreme variability in performance year over year. one or two beneficiaries ending up in the emergency department may mean the difference between savings and losses for a rural aco and its participants. the variability of the mssp made more variable by the proposed changes makes it unrealistic for rural hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural health clinics, federally qualified health centers and independent practices to continue participating in this program. the current proposals will create a rural-urban divide in risk-based contract participation. as currently proposed, only urban hospitals and systems will have the financial reserves to assume the proposed levels of risk.\r\nhospital board members, especially rural hospital board members, will never approve any level of risk tied to the proposed degree of variability, particularly when tied to a decreased share in savings. rural hospitals and by extension the rural independent practices they support are unable and unwilling to assume the proposed levels of risk. cms must alter the proposed changes to provide opportunity for rural hospitals to participate in the mssp without risking the financial viability of their organization. cms committed to bringing a rural healthcare focus to cms healthcare delivery and payment reform initiatives in the rural health strategy published in early 2018. this commitment is missing from the proposed rule. rural is mentioned throughout the document but there is no discussion of a rural-specific focus on participation criteria.\r\nrural aco participants need access to a upside only or one-sided track in the mssp. the current track 1 is the only viable opportunity for rural acos to participate in a medicare value-based model. there are other options, but the mssp aco remains the only option for independent rural healthcare organizations to work together to address the cost and quality of care. but even with this model, the potential for earning enough shared savings to build sustainable cash reserves for taking risk is non-existent.\r\ncms must develop exclusions specific to rural acos: exclusion from the proposed basic glide path and enhanced track; exclusion from proposed schedule for moving between basic and enhanced; and, exclusion from high and low revenue designations.\r\ncms must define rural acos as: aco shall not include a hospital as an aco participant or aco provider/supplier unless the hospital is an inpatient prospective payment system hospital with fewer than 100 beds or a critical access hospital; and, 75% or more of the acos participants are located in counties designated as rural or frontier.\r\ncms must provide the following opportunities for rural acos: 50% share of savings; basic rural: upside-only for two 5-year agreement terms with aggregate show of savings and quality attainment at the end of each agreement period; and, enhanced rural: option to move to a graduated risk model when financially ready. rural acos taking on risk would have three years at proposed basic level c then a year each in proposed basic levels d and e. the share in

understand the new tracks and make an educated decision on whether to continue in the mssp. the final rule most likely won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be published until later in 2018, providing at most 6 months to truly determine whether the new tracks are a financially viable option for current and new aco participants. the proposed 6 months is not enough time to make such an impactful decision. it will cause many more acos to drop out of the program than currently expected. the july 1, 2019 start date fails to provide adequate time to analyze the final rule, explain the new model to  participants  and  gain  participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 buy-in  to  the  new  mssp  model. the  proposed  rule  includes substantial changes to the mssp. acos need more than 6 months to adequately vet participation options and potential losses/savings. additionally, the proposed 6-month extension is causing aco participants to back out of the mssp because of the level of uncertainty that now pervades the program. the two 6-month performance years will cause increased burden on providers, practices, acos and cms. they will require a duplication of administrative tasks, data compilation and analytics, benchmark and attribution calculations, and quality reporting. these tasks are expensive and time consuming. requiring acos and cms contractors to complete these tasks twice is burdensome and needlessly expensive. the  proposal  to  prorate  the  shared  savings/shared losses  based  on  the first 6-month  period  of participation fails to account for habitual behavior of medicare beneficiaries. most annual wellness visits are performed in the 3rd and 4th quarters of the calendar year. a calendar year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s q1 and q2 are typically low-performing quarters. the majority of americans wait to visit the doctor until their deductible is met, which usually occurs towards the end of the calendar year. medicare beneficiaries follow this practice, even  with free preventive  services  like  annual  wellness  visits. annual  wellness  visits  are  the  primary opportunity for aco participants to capture quality measures and attribution; two key aspects of overall aco performance. using only q1 and q2 will result in inaccurate quality and financial performance. cms should provide an additional opportunity for aco participants to join a new aco for py2019 because of the short period of time between the proposed rule being published (august 9, 2018) and the final deadline for adding participants for py2019 (september 28, 2018). the proposed rule caused confusion and uncertainty in the mssp and many aco participants missed the date to join other acos due to this confusion and uncertainty. this additional date should be set 1 month after the final rule publication date. cms should institute a january 1, 2020 start date for new agreement periods, offer a 1-year extension to participation agreements ending on december 31, 2018, and provide an additional opportunity to add aco participants to the py2019 participant list.\n1. acos that entered a first or second agreement period with a start date of january 1, 2016, may elect \n to extend their agreement period for an optional fourth performance year, defined as the 12-month period from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019; and,\n2. the first agreement periods under the new participation options and all other applicable proposed \n changes will go into effect for a january 1, 2020 start date.\n3. the py2019 aco participant and snf affiliate change request review cycle has been updated to \n [7] track 1+. it is assumed that 2015 cehrt will be required to meet the base requirements of level e participation. if aco-11 is removed, as proposed, will the 2015 cehrt requirement for 2019 likewise be removed? it is unclear how the mssp proposed rule interacts with the 2019 pfs proposed rule. very few rural facilities currently utilize all 2015 cehrt. the cost to transition quickly is prohibitive. cms will need to develop a funding program to assist rural organizations with implementing 2015 cehrt if required to transition by 2019. the  proposed  change  to allow beneficiary opt-in completely misses the  mark.  requiring beneficiaries to decide to opt-in to an aco at the first primary care visit of each year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even with a template \u00e2\u0080\u0093 adds time to the visit that should be spent discussing the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wellbeing and health. it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a burden to the practices to add yet another disclaimer to review with patients. the proposed  rule fails  to  improve  the  beneficiary  notification process, nor  does  it  reduce administrative burden on practices. additionally, the mssp tried the opt-in approach before and removed the requirement in 2015 due to the increased burden it placed on practices. cms must remove this proposed change to the beneficiary assignment

reflected in cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s implementation of a rural health strategy.  we look forward to our continued collaboration to improve health care access and quality throughout rural america.\nnrha is a non-profit membership organization with more than 21,000 members nationwide that provides leadership on rural health issues.  our membership includes nearly every component of rural america\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care infrastructure, including rural community hospitals, critical access hospitals, doctors, nurses and patients.  we work to improve rural america\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health needs through government advocacy, communications, education and research.\nwe appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued emphasis on narrowing the gap between rural patients and providers. this letter outlines suggestions and recommendations that we believe will strengthen this proposed rule to allow financially vulnerable rural providers a meaningful opportunity to participate in the program. we look forward to our continued collaboration to further refine the program to meet our shared goals of robust rural participation coupled with local access to care for rural beneficiaries.\nnrha urges cms to maintain a one-sided risk option for rural and safety net providers. while we understand your desire to move more providers into two-sided risk we believe most rural providers would opt out rather than participating, leaving the program without rural participation and rural populations without the added benefits of the aco program. acos have provided increased population health activities that provide an opportunity to keep the population healthy, while also providing providers the flexibility to address patient needs and care coordination that may not be otherwise permissible. this provides real benefits to the patients and providers. however, rural providers are safety net providers essential for the health of their communities. without these critical local points of access to care, rural communities would quickly wither and die.\nrural hospitals are often the number one or two largest employer in town and attracting other employers in contingent on them having local access to a hospital with the services they envision their workforce needing. furthermore, most physicians in rural are hospital based, or have a crucial connection with the hospital. if the hospital closes, those physicians leave the community along with the nurses and pharmacist and other professionals. currently 44 percent of rural hospitals are operating at a loss, up from 40 percent just a year ago. since 2010, 89 rural hospitals have closed and left their community without local access to care.\nthe risk, particularly as felt by rural hospital boards, would be deemed too great to remain in an aco if two-sided risk was required. it is important to understand the governance structure of rural community health systems. the vast majority of rural community hospital boards of directors are not steeped in the world of health care delivery and are new to delivery system reform and payment. the board is frequently made of up community leaders, for example a farmer or rancher, school teachers, clergy from the local church, bankers, and other community leaders. the board fully understand the community and works diligently to understand the hospital operations to make the best decisions for the community. the board\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval is required to move into risk arrangements. appropriately, the board\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main concern is the viability of the hospital and thus the community at large. such a board is unlikely to accept an arrangement where leadership cannot guarantee they will not have to make a payment to cms for losses. caravan health, a national rural aco, has experience with more than 250 rural health systems and their boards of directors, they estimate that very few rural health system boards will approve a risk arrangement and will terminate participation in the mssp, or not begin the journey towards better community health.\npat schou, executive director of the illinois critical access hospital network (which has a number of hospitals in an aco) said that their hospitals \u00e2\u0080\u009chave reduced the spend [for medicare] but have not reached shared savings [being able to reap additional payments from medicare]. many have negative margins or maybe a positive margin of 1 percent so how can they actually take on risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d she points out their network rural hospitals spent two times as much money investing in the aco as they received from aim dollars. \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t promise [hospital] boards that they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to write a check [to medicare to cover any loses]. you cannot do anything without board approval. the flaw is boards will never say yes to this level of risk\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009cto assume risk they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that but $83 million shows we benefit medicare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nit is this background that is essential to understand in order to understand why rural hospitals are unable to take on down side risk. it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that they are not providing excellent care that is of high value. it is simply that the risk is too great. even rural hospitals that are not part of the 44 percent operating at a loss have razor thin margins. what cms would deem a \u00e2\u0080\u009csmall\u00e2\u0080\u009d loss would be catastrophic for these small providers and could result in closure. that closure then results in loss of access to necessary care for the community, inability to attract or keep local businesses resulting in a cascading loss of other community businesses such as the local bank, grocery store, and restaurants. ultimately, as one reporter discovered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you want to watch a rural community

money, but is the loss of their community. while this risk may not be high, especially based on previous performance, it is simply too high a cost for the providers to be willing to gamble.\n\u0002 a hospital crisis is killing rural communities. this state is \u00e2\u0080\u0098ground zero.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by lauren weber and andy miller, 9/22/2017. available at https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rural-hospitals-closure-georgia_us_59c02bf4e4b087fdf5075e38\nrural acos face the issue of a vulnerable patient population that is older, sicker, and poorer than their urban counterparts, including a higher chronic disease burden. furthermore, with the closure of 89 rural hospitals since 2010, rural america is also facing increasing issues of access to care. rural beneficiaries must travel further to receive care in emergency as well as cost saving preventive services and ongoing monitoring and care for chronic disease. these same rural beneficiaries often struggle with lack of transportation or the financial resources to make these medically necessary trips. all of these factors highlight the need for rural acos to manage this vulnerable population, while also highlighting the reasons that making rural aco unable to sustainably take on downside risk at this point in the program. rural providers have made great strides in successfully working with and managing this vulnerable patient population, however, the impact of small numbers, provider shortages, cultural challenges, sociodemographic challenges, limited financial resources for necessary data collection and management, and limited access to health care necessitate the ability to remain in the program without requiring acos to accept two-sided risk.\nfurthermore, these providers have already taken on a downside risk in the form of the investments required to participate and succeed in the aco program. some expenditures expended by a hospital participating in an aco, margret mary health in batesville indiana included, educating physicians, staff and board members, the cost associated with the application process approval with cms, management time to evaluate and implement actions, it system to process the cms data and make it useable for the care team, care coordinator rns to work with our chronic patients who were not making progress, and costs associated with the waiver program (i.e. we purchased and van and hired staff to pick up patients for appointments who have undependable transportation). this is by no means an exhaustive list and is only a single hospital participating in an aco. the hospital is pleased with the changes and the aco participation is paying off in higher quality of care that has resulted in greatly improved diabetes compliance rates, reduced the number of er visits and admissions for many of the patients in the program. while the hospital continues to participate because of their strong mission to help the patients in their community the positive changes in patient care have resulted in reduction of er visits and inpatient revenue, a further \u00e2\u0080\u009ccost\u00e2\u0080\u009d of aco participation. indeed, then secretary of hhs sylvia burwell estimate that the startup cost for an aco at a 200-bed hospital is $5.3 million and the annual operating costs for the aco is $6.3 million. since many of the costs are not based on the number of participating patients, the cost per covered life is often higher in a rural context.\nfinally, there is no credible evidence presented by cms that demonstrates that taking on two side-risk increases performance. indeed, the risk-free aim acos saved cms $22.70 per beneficiary per month compared to risk-bearing nextgen acos, which only saved $18.20 per beneficiary per month. the lower shared savings for the aim acos resulted even greater savings to the trust fund, $20 per beneficiary per month vs only $11.20 for nextgen. though we speak in averages, these results were not equally achieved by all participating acos, despite all having the same down side risk motivations. in fact, it was only four of the eighteen nexgen acos that generated more than half of the resulting savings.\ntaking on risk is not the ultimate goal, the goal of the aco program is to produce savings, or flat spending, to the medicare trust fund without a degradation in quality. two-sided risk is only a potential tool in achieving this goal. however, a forced push towards taking on risk will result in rural providers simply dropping out of the program since they cannot take on risk. the ultimate result will be rural patients and providers lose the benefits of participation in the aco program and the medicare trust fund loses out on the clearly demonstrated benefits of rural participation, including lower hospitalization rates and better care management. the proposed push for rural taking on risk would result in either rural providers pulling out of the program or the potential that an aberrant year or couple of patients could result in financial loses that could result in closure of the aco or participating hospitals or practices.\nsmall and rural acos have achieved excellent clinical quality scores above national averages even as they beat their spending benchmarks, however, the natural year-to-year variation in performance and risk of paying back shared losses even in a single year is too much uncertainty for providers that already struggle with low or negative margins. experience shows that rural acos overall have very strong financial performance under a limited risk scenario. the aco investment model (aim) program included 45 acos that received start-up funding from cms in 2015 and 2016. this cohort of mostly rural providers in track 1 saved more per capita than track 3 acos for the 2017 performance year even without downside risk. cms should allow these acos to continue these promising results without increasing the level of risk.\ncentral to this discussion about aco risk is scale. put simply, smaller organizations are less able to take on risk than those with more attributed lives. earlier this year, caravan health published data showing the variation in results from 2013 to 2016 based on aco size.  these charts illustrate the relationship between variable results and aco size. this first chart shows the annual savings and losses of all acos plotted against number of patient lives.\nthis second chart shows the year over year change in savings and losses in acos by size.\nthe charts make the relationship clear \u00e2\u0080\u0093 smaller acos have much less control over the level of savings or losses they experience each year. these acos can be doing everything right and still not realize savings due to the inherent unpredictability of year over year health care costs. the aco program would be ill-served by pushing smaller and rural acos into risk - the proof is in the data.\ncms should consider policy alternatives for those acos who cannot tolerate being held financially responsible for making a payment for losses they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control. one option is adjusting the corridors for determining shared savings and losses. the current minimum savings/loss rates function as risk corridors to protect both the aco and the government from the volatility of health spending. if those corridors were widened, acos would have some more breathing room for these inevitable swings, while still working toward better population health and shared savings. caravan health analysis shows that the risk corridors are currently set at a confidence interval of approximately 90 percent. those could be increased (or widened) to 95 percent or higher to create more integrity behind shared savings or losses.\nnrha supports the changes to the benchmarking methodology, but believes it is important to go further to address the problem of regional skew in health care costs. nrha appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acknowledgment of the disproportionate impact of the regional benchmark on rural providers. we are concerned that the current that rural beneficiaries historical underuse of health care due to limited access to care and cultural factors that often lead to low utilization mean financially fragile rural providers could risk the ability to provide services to an underserved population. while nrha is supportive of the use of regional data to rebase historical benchmarks, we believe beneficiaries that are not utilizing services should be excluded from the benchmark. additionally, cms should consider a way to consider the factors leading to low utilization such as a lack of access to care or high levels of undiagnosed chronic disease (as indicated by sociodemographic risk factors) that do not represent the desired effect of the program.\nfurthermore, we are concerned that the proposed remedy, to weight the regional benchmark in inverse proportion to its market share, would not address the poor incentive created by the current calculation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that the better an aco performs, the more it reduces its regional benchmark, effectively reducing the opportunity for future savings. one potential solution would be expanding region size as is done in setting benchmarks for medicare advantage.\nnrha is pleased with the increased flexibility provided in the proposed rule for acos. the proposed beneficiary incentive program is a promising tool for aco participants and we urge cms to maintain flexibility for acos to implement them on a participant level, as appropriate for their area and patient population. while we agree it is helpful for the aco to apply for waiver programs as a collective to ensure the aco board is involved in the required decision-making, participants within an aco often operate in different environments that are not served well by a one-size-fits-all approach. this will be especially true in the case of the beneficiary incentive program where aco participants may want to assign different incentive amounts based upon their region. furthermore, we encourage cms to allow the elimination of patient cost sharing for certain health care services shown to provide high value such as care management services. the aco program highlights the value of annual wellness visits and chronic care management to successfully improving the quality and lowering the cost of care. while these strategies have been shown to yield savings to cms, the administrative hassle of collecting co-payments for chronic care management leads many providers to simply not offer the service. for providers that continue to offer the service, they face the uphill battle of collecting the required co-payment without damaging the patient-provider relationship.\nnrha opposed to the new beneficiary notification requirement proposed by cms. not only is this new requirement extremely burdensome, but this exact type of notification has already been tried by cms in the pioneer aco program and rightly rejected.\ncms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal is particularly confounding in light of the already robust process in place. cms currently requires aco participants to post the aco poster in all their facilities and make the notice to patients available in all primary care settings. these notices are required to be on a cms template, to which cms makes minor changes every year. the hassle of keeping up with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new templates and replacing posters present in every aco facility is already quite burdensome and costly to participants. cms provides no evidence that the posters and notices are not working and proposes to add a third, even more burdensome requirement, without modification of the existing two.\nit is precisely these types of unnecessary hoops that prevent organizations from wanting to engage in acos. additionally, cms offers zero evidence that medicare beneficiaries are not already adequately notified. experience has proven that notifications tend to confuse patients more than anything, creating stigma and actually reducing the provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to effectively manage the care of their patients. cms repeatedly emphasizes that that providers, not patients, participate in the aco, and thus it is unclear that beneficiaries require any additional notification regarding the confusing world of alternative payment models in which their provider is involved.\nall medicare acos are qualified alternative payment models (apms) under the medicare access and chip reauthorization act (macra). what is defined as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore than nominal financial risk\u00e2\u0080\u009d should be defined to include more than just relative gains and losses to the medicare trust fund, but should be instead based on what the provider participating in the aco gains or loses. there are many financial risks that can be far more than nominal that the medicare trust fund approach overlooks, however, including:  start-up costs to get the aco off the ground such as data analysis and establishing procedures for coordinating care and sharing information; ongoing costs for new employees such as care managers; and foregone revenue from billable services that are reduced by the physicians participating in an aco due to use of appropriateness guidelines and efforts to reduce exacerbations of patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 conditions requiring emergency department visits and hospitalizations.\nwhile nrha appreciated cms recognizing the special impacts programs may have on rural providers, we are concerned that the exclusion of rural providers from incentive programs results in no positive payment adjustments. this lack of payment adjustment is another de facto cut to rural providers since medical inflation reduces the value of those payments. while we appreciate the intent behind these exclusions are to spare rural providers the devastating downside risk, we believe the aco program and other incentive programs can and should be modified to allow rural participation. modest modification could allow rural providers to thrive in the programs, as has been seen in the aim program. such program participation is beneficial to both the medicare trust fund and the rural patient population served. small changes such as continuation of the aim funding, ability to remain in the track 1 equivalent program, and changes to the benchmarking methodology will allow rural providers to participate and thrive.\nthank you for the chance to offer comments on this proposed rule, and for your consideration on our comments.  we very much look forward to continuing our work together to ensure our mutual goal of improving quality of and access to care.  if you would like additional information, please contact diane calmus at dcalmus@nrharural.org, or

coordinate care, improve quality, and reduce the total cost of care by facilitating access to community pharmacy care. our comments focus on four main areas:\n 1) role of pharmacy care in quality improvement and total cost of care; 2) opportunities to integrate community pharmacy care into acos and apms; 3) aligning quality measures across programs and care settings; and, 4) early evidence on the role of pharmacy care in advancing population health and the potential to integrate care into value-based payments.\n 1) role of pharmacy care in advancing value over the last several decades, community pharmacies have evolved into patient-centered healthcare destinations offering a range of accessible and affordable clinical care services including chronic care management and disease state monitoring, smoking cessation programs, transitions of care coordination, minor ailment care, immunization screening and administration, chronic and acute disease screening, mental health services, medication management, health and wellness programs, lifestyle counseling, and more. the needs of a growing medicare population, increased burden from chronic disease, provider shortages and recent projections on the solvency of the medicare trust fund have all increased the urgency to develop new provider collaborations and evolve existing payment models to improve quality and outcomes and reduce costs more quickly.2\n health services research \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and our members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experiences \u00e2\u0080\u0093 illustrate the key role that community pharmacies are already playing in the healthcare continuum. community pharmacists routinely collaborate with other healthcare providers, health systems, and caregivers to positively address patient outcomes and mitigate rising healthcare costs.3 medication adherence is one of the most cited areas where community pharmacies can play a role in improving health outcomes and reducing costs. select studies illustrating the impacts of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and potential from \u00e2\u0080\u0093 improved medication adherence are described below. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 healthcare spending on non-optimal medication therapy (estimated at $528.4 billion per year)4 and medication non-adherence (estimated at $100-290 billion per year and attributed to 10% of hospitalizations)5 could be significantly decreased with the development of more purposeful policies and programs that leverage patient touch points in the community setting and that fully utilize the skillset of community pharmacists. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the pennsylvania project evaluated a pharmacy-based medication adherence initiative across 283 pharmacies. the intervention, which included pharmacist-led screening for medication non-adherence and counseling for those at an increased risk, led to statistically significant improvement in medication adherence for all medication classes that were studied, and an annual per patient cost savings of $241 for improved adherence to oral diabetes medications and $341 related to improved adherence to statin medications.6\n 2 dexter, p., miller, d., clark, d. et al.

(2013). pharmacists belong in accountable care organizations and integrated care teams. health affairs, 32(11), 1963-70. 16 colla, c., lewis, v., beaulieu, j. et al.

(2015). role of pharmacy services in accountable care organizations. journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy. 21(4), 338-344.\n\n the study also examined the hit capabilities needed to manage quality and prescription drug costs. while about half of all acos could e-prescribe, confirm prescription fills, and maintain an active medication list in the ehr, only 10% reported the ability to integrate inpatient and outpatient data (e.g. medication data) from outside the aco in the ehr.18 addressing these data sharing gaps and capabilities are critical to facilitating the sharing of the data that acos, pdps, and pharmacies individually have to improve quality and efficiency and reduce costs. based on the research and our members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experiences we recommend that cms:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 work with community-based pharmacies in addition to acos and standalone pdps to address data sharing barriers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and support the connection of pharmacies to ehrs and other beneficiary records. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 test the impact of reimbursing pharmacy services and recognizing pharmacists as healthcare providers under medicare part b. testing the impact of these policies could be limited to the risk-bearing tracks of the mssp and to those acos that are entering into innovative new business arrangements with standalone pdps.\n we believe this would allow cms to fully assess the impact of better integrating part d drug costs and pharmaceutical management on quality, outcomes, and costs.\n\n 3) aligning quality measures across programs and care settings further, nacds has also examined quality measures under the merit-based incentive payment program (mips) which can be significantly influenced at the community pharmacy point of care \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and their overlap with measures required or included across other medicare programs. a wide range of pharmacy-level metrics are also part of mssp aco measure sets, including: \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedication reconciliation post-discharge\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor diabetes control\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cinfluenza immunization\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdepression utilization of the phq-9\u00e2\u0080\u009d among others. our members have been on the path to quality and value-based payment for several years.  in fact, many are using dashboards to assess their performance on quality measures. we applaud cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to align and refine quality measures across programs and payers through the meaningful measures initiative \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and ask for greater alignment across cms programs, healthcare settings including community pharmacies, and commercial payers. aligned quality measurement will support beneficiaries receiving appropriate care \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and a focus on patient outcomes across the care continuum.\n\n 4) evidence on pharmacies supporting population health and value nacds has a strong commitment to research to understand the role and potential for pharmacy care to advance population health and value-based care. in 2017, nacds\n launched three demonstration projects funded by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) that fostered collaboration across providers, community pharmacies, and immunization registries to increase adult immunization rates. we collaborated with 319 pharmacies across four states to test the delivery of influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, and pertussis vaccines in community pharmacies. researchers were also asked to examine the potential for creating value-based payments to support pharmacy-based immunizations. early results from these demonstrations found that the interventions increased most immunization rates from 2016-2017 with the most consistent increases across all sites seen for influenza (20-45%) and pertussis (13-74%) vaccines.19\n researchers also began to conceptualize how value-based payment models could be structured for community pharmacies. for instance, the university of pittsburgh medical center (upmc) tried to address estimated cost avoidance, vaccine effectiveness, and herd immunity as part of the payment model.20 they formulated a three-tiered model of increasing achievement tied to increasing reward. goals for each tier were defined as percent increases in vaccination rates from the year immediately preceding and incentives were determined as a percentage of direct medical costs avoided to be shared between the payer and provider.21 these research efforts are laying the groundwork for designing more inclusive value-based payment models\u00e2\u0080\u0093 and show the potential for integrating pharmacy care into existing alternative payment models (apms) such as through the mssp.\n while value-based payment models in community pharmacy are still in their early stages, there is significant potential to improve quality and reduce costs from more systematic testing and inclusion. one recent example is wellmark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inclusion of a value-based model, focused on better serving patients with asthma, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and depression in high performing independent and chain pharmacies in iowa and south dakota. goals of this program include ensuring that the patient is on the right drug and is adherent, and in the longer-term, to reduce emergency department visits, hospital readmissions, and total cost of care. while impacts of the wellmark model are too early to assess, it was based on the continuous medication monitoring (comm) pharmacy pilot, which was designed to assess the effects of comm on total costs of care, proportion of days covered (pdc) rates and the use of high-risk medications by elderly patients. the pilot results demonstrated lower total costs of care and meaningfully better medication adherence. per member per month (pmpm) costs were approximately $300 lower for patients who received medications only from the pharmacy offering the comm program as compared to patients receiving medications from other pharmacies. this pilot demonstrated that paying pharmacists to proactively address the safety, effectiveness, and adherence of medications at the time of dispensing can support optimization of medication therapy and decrease costs.22\n in addition, the chart below illustrates the impact of pharmacy care on patient outcomes and related costs:\n author title of article brief description of intervention results\n tran mt, et\nal. \n modeling the cost- effectiveness of a smoking cessation program in a community pharmacy practice the cost effectiveness of a pharmacist- directed smoking cessation program that achieved abstinence of at least 1 year in 25% of patients was studied. depending on the smoker's age at the time of cessation, the incremental discounted cost-effectiveness was $720- 1,418/life-year saved.\n brennan ta, et al. an integrated pharmacy-based program improved medication prescription and adherence rates in diabetes patients pharmacists provided counseling for adherence to diabetes medications and recommendations for other medications often used in tandem with diabetes medications aimed at reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease (ace-inhibitors or arbs and/or statins). patients were identified by a pbm for the intervention. pharmacist-based interventions are effective in improving medication adherence and encouraging patients to start taking medications they need as part of an evidence-based treatment regimen. the return on investment of the initiative was estimated at 3:1. vegter s, et\nal. \n improving adherence to lipid-lowering the pharmaceutical care program, medication monitoring and optimization, was initiated in community pharmacies to focus on lipid-lowering therapy in new patients. the follow-up period was 1 year. patients in the program had a lower risk for discontinuing therapy and in a cohort of 1,000 patients, the intervention resulted in a reduction of 7 nonfatal strokes, 2 fatal strokes, 16 nonfatal heart attacks, 7 fatal heart attacks, and 16 revascularizations over patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lifetimes. the intervention also produced considerable net cost savings.\n spence mm, et al. evaluation of an outpatient pharmacy clinical services program on adherence and clinical outcomes among patients with diabetes and/or coronary artery disease an outpatient pharmacy clinical service program targeted nonadherent diabetes mellitus and/or coronary artery disease patients with hemoglobin a1c and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol outside clinical goals. patients who received the outpatient pharmacy clinical service program were more likely to be adherent with their diabetes medications (53.5% compared to 37.4%). this group was also more likely to continue taking their medication, less likely to have an emergency department visit, and the return on investment for this program was estimated at 5.79:1.\n lee jk, et al. effect of a pharmacy care program on medication adherence, blood pressure, and low- density lipoprotein cholesterol: a randomized trial comprehensive pharmacy care program for elderly patients aged 65 years and older with coronary risk factors to improve medication adherence and its associated effects on blood pressure (bp) and ldl levels pharmacy care program led to increases in medication adherence, medication persistence, and clinically meaningful reductions in bp. after 6 months of intervention, medication adherence increased from baseline of 61.2% to 96.9% and associated with significant improvements in systolic bp (133.2 to\n129.9) and ldl-c levels (91.7 to 86.8). \n van boven jf, et al. medication monitoring and optimization: a targeted pharmacist program for effective and cost- effective improvement of chronic therapy adherence medication monitoring and optimization (memo) program is a platform for monitoring and improving therapy adherence through facilitation of targeted and continuous patient- centered pharmaceutical care around chronic medications. for osteoporosis, therapy discontinuation after 1 year was\n16.1% in the memo patients, \n compared with 31.7% in the control patients. for dyslipidemia, the therapy discontinuation rate was 13.6% in the memo cohort and 25.9% in the control group. the cost- effective aspect was favorable for the primary prevention population and significant for the secondary prevention population (lower costs and more health gains).\n klepser dg, et al. cost-effectiveness of pharmacist- provided treatment of adult pharyngitis community pharmacists used a rapid antigen detection test for strep throat and provided medication for positive results during the research project. the cost associated with providing the treatment was compared to 5 physician-provided treatment strategies for strep throat. pharmacist treatment of strep throat was the most cost effective.\n cranor cw, et al. the asheville project: short- term outcomes of a community pharmacy diabetes care program. patients scheduled consultations with pharmacists over 7-9 months. during the appointments, pharmacists provided counseling and education, training on the use of blood glucose monitors, and clinical assessment of the patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 diabetes including monitoring, follow-up, and referral. patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a1c measurements (a 3- month assessment of blood sugar) were significantly reduced. researchers observed a 16% decrease in all-diagnosis costs.\n\n

american hospital association (aha) detailed comments on the medicare shared savings program (mssp) proposed rule\n differentiation of participation options for high- and low-revenue accountable care organizations (acos)\n in order to provide acos with \u00e2\u0080\u009cpathways to success\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the mssp, cms proposes to redesign the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation options. specifically, the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) would discontinue tracks 1 and 2 and the deferred renewal option. instead, it would offer two tracks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 basic and enhanced \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that eligible acos could enter for an agreement period of not less than five years. the basic track would include a glide path to risk consisting of five levels, but only certain acos would be permitted to enter the program at the start of the glide path with upside-only risk. the enhanced track would mirror the current track 3.\n cms proposes additional policies to distinguish among acos and restrict some acos to only certain participation options. one such proposed distinction is between what cms has termed \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh-revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos. to define low- and high-revenue acos, the agency would assess the degree of control an aco holds over the medicare expenditures of its assigned beneficiaries in terms of how much of its beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 revenue it \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaptures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d specifically, if an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medicare part a and b fee-for-service (ffs) revenue is 25 percent or more of the total medicare part a and b ffs expenditures for its assigned beneficiaries, cms would consider that aco \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh- revenue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d in addition, cms proposes to differentiate between \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos, based on acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 prior experience in \u00e2\u0080\u009cperformance-based\u00e2\u0080\u009d (or two- sided) risk medicare acos.\n cms proposes to limit high-revenue acos, which the agency states are often hospital- led, to a single agreement period in the basic track. conversely, it proposes to allow low-revenue acos to participate in two agreement periods in the basic track. additionally, cms proposes to prohibit experienced, high-revenue acos from entering the basic track at any level, and would instead limit them to immediate participation in the proposed enhanced track. cms would allow experienced, low-revenue acos to participate in level e of the basic track for up to two agreement periods before requiring them to transition to the enhanced track. cms also considers and seeks comments on proposals to allow low-revenue acos to have potentially greater access to shared savings than high-revenue acos.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 5 of 25\n\n degree of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control over its assigned beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 medicare expenditures indicates that it is able to take on more risk, more quickly. as such, we urge cms not to finalize any proposals that differentiate between high- and low-revenue acos, or between acos with and without hospital participation, at this time. such proposals are unwarranted and could have negative effects on patient care, as well as cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to transition our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care system to one that pays for value instead of volume. in short:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the bifurcation of participation options for high- and low-revenue acos creates an un-level playing field based on faulty and incomplete definitions, assumptions and data; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 risk readiness is not determined by aco composition; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the proposal fails to empower acos to maximize their contribution to patient care and is a distraction from the goals of acos and cms.\n the bifurcation of participation options for high- and low-revenue acos creates an un-level playing field based on faulty and incomplete definitions, assumptions and data. cms bases its proposal to differentiate between high- and low-revenue acos on incomplete and misguided data that suggest \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos outperform \u00e2\u0080\u009chospital- led\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos, as well as its assumption that high-revenue acos are likely to include hospitals, health systems, and/or other institutional providers. however, the results of the aco program cannot be explained simply by dividing the world into high- and low-revenue or hospital- and physician-led. as such, cms should not base such significant changes to the mssp on these distinctions. this is especially true given that, in 2017, only approximately one third of acos achieved any shared savings at all.1 any generalizations about which acos are more successful than others would not advance the goals of the mssp to improve the quality of patient care and reduce costs.\n under the mssp as it currently stands, cms defines an aco as \u00e2\u0080\u009chospital-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d only if it includes an inpatient taxpayer identification number (tin) on the participant list it submits to cms. this definition misrepresents the wide range of hospitals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 involvement in acos, including:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 jointly initiating and leading an aco with a physician group; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 participating in the aco contract without a leadership role; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 contracting with a physician group for health system services and resources without appearing on the physician group aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participant list; or \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 participating in another manner.\n for example, an academic medical center might have an aco that is run through its faculty practice; cms would call this aco \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d despite the obviously critical\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 6 of 25\n\n role the academic medical center would play in providing care to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patients. as another example, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d aco may be truly led by an investor, which would not be reflected in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participant list. indeed, cms itself recognizes this fallacy of relying on participant lists when it indicated that to move from being a high- to low-revenue aco, an aco could simply remove a hospital from its participant list but make no other changes to its care delivery.\n this is even more troubling considering the vagueness with which the specifics of the proposal are presented in the rule. for example, cms neither sufficiently explains the basis for its proposed threshold of 25 percent to identify high-revenue acos, nor provides any indication of which current acos would be considered high- or low- revenue. the agency does not even provide acos with the tools to run a calculation themselves to determine whether they are high- or low-revenue and, in fact, recognizes it would be difficult for acos to do so. cms indicates in the rule that it would inform an aco of whether it is high- or low-revenue only after it has submitted its application for participation in the mssp. however, by that point, acos and their participants would have already had to make several critical participation decisions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all with woefully inadequate information. this is especially true for existing acos that have already experienced the long lag time between when they complete their performance years and when they receive their performance data from cms, as well as fluctuations in their lists of assigned beneficiaries, or those that do not have a team of actuaries that can run necessary calculations for them. if the rule is finalized as proposed, this lack of transparency and resources from cms would leave acos having to make uninformed decisions about a full five years of participation. we strongly recommend cms release data on which it based these and all other proposals and provide acos with significantly more tools and resources to run calculations themselves.\n differentiation between high- and low-revenue acos based on flawed data. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed differentiation of high- and low-revenue acos is based on misleading definitions and inaccurate data regarding the performance of physician- and hospital-led acos. while some differentiation between participants may be appropriate, favoring a certain provider type or aco size over another simply incentivizes physicians and hospitals to distrust one another rather than improve care coordination. cms cannot effectuate sustainable change in care delivery without having all providers of care at the same table.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 7 of 25\n\n of the success of an aco as it fails to account for not only methodological issues with setting the benchmarks but also the spillover effect on patients who are not participating in an aco that nonetheless benefit from its integrated care networks, care coordination and other operational infrastructure.\n in fact, a methodology that calculates how much shared savings was earned against a benchmark depends equally, if not more, on the benchmark itself (and the market context in which it is set) than on the efforts of the aco. two acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 regardless of whether or not a hospital participates in them \u00e2\u0080\u0093 could be performing exactly the same but have completely different results because their benchmarks are different. no aco can decline its expenses as quickly as its benchmark declines, which means that no matter how well an aco may perform, it still may fail to earn shared savings. cms may not even be able to explain the degree of change in an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark: one of our members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 acos saw its benchmark decline by $1000 in a single rebasing and no one, including cms, could explain why.\n the interrelationship between cms programs can also impact shared savings calculations. for example, the physicians of some of our members participating in acos also participate in the comprehensive primary care plus (cpc+) program, through which participants receive upfront care management fees. in the mssp, the millions of dollars that these acos spent in care coordination, which included those care management fees, were counted as an expense of the acos, impacting their benchmarks. in addition, two of our member hospitals that participate in one of these acos also began participation in the bundled payments for care improvement (bpci) advanced initiative earlier this month; any savings generated from patients that are assigned to the aco that trigger a bpci advanced episode will be attributed to the hospital as a bpci advanced participant, not the aco.\n other studies performed by external researchers that rely on cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitions of hospital- and physician-led also misstate the difference in savings between the two groups. for example, in a study published in the new england journal of medicine on sept. 5, 2018, the authors conclude that physician groups that participated in acos saved money for medicare \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhereas hospital-integrated acos did not produce savings (on average) during the same period.\u00e2\u0080\u009d2 however, a closer analysis of the results in the study, using the authors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 own methodology of finding significance at the 5 percent level, demonstrates that their conclusion is not supported. the authors base their conclusion on their comparison of the performance of physician-led and hospital-led acos over eight years (years one, two and three of the cohort that entered the aco program in 2012, years one, two and three of the 2013 cohort and years one and two of the 2014 cohort). however, in only two of those eight years were the differences in savings between physician-led and hospital-led acos statistically significant. therefore, even though they used different methodologies, both cms and other researchers have\n\n2 j. michael mcwilliams, et al., medicare spending after 3 years of the medicare shared savings \n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 8 of 25\n\n significantly overstated the degree to which the performance of hospital-led acos differs from that of physician-led acos. cms should not base a major redesign of the mssp participation options on a single methodological approach nor on data that lack clarity and conclusiveness.\n moreover, when using more appropriate definitions of aco composition, our analysis revealed that acos with hospital participation actually saved more for the medicare trust fund than those without hospital participation. specifically, we analyzed cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list of the 472 acos that participated in the mssp in 2017 and deemed acos with any hospital participation as \u00e2\u0080\u009chospital-affiliated\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos. this methodology captures the important contributions that hospitals make to the care of aco beneficiaries, regardless of whether they are listed on acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 participant lists. our analysis found that nearly 20 percent of the acos that cms would characterize as physician-led, in fact, have affiliated hospitals contributing to the care of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries. and, our analysis demonstrates that, in 2017, hospital-affiliated acos saved a total of approximately $174 million, while non-hospital-affiliated acos saved a total of approximately $140 million.3 these numbers stand in stark contrast to the calculation of savings using cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitions of aco leadership; those definitions suggest hospital-led acos saved a total of approximately of $72 million and other acos saved a total of approximately $241 million in 2017. clearly, hospitals have made significant contributions to the savings to the medicare program that acos have achieved and should not be treated otherwise. thus, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed revisions to the mssp that rely on results suggesting \u00e2\u0080\u009chospital-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos underperform as compared with \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos are misguided and based upon inaccurate definitions of these acos and inconclusive evidence about their performance.\n we conducted additional analysis to demonstrate that small changes in definitions can lead to large variations in results. for example, if we define \u00e2\u0080\u009csmall\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos as those with fewer than 10,000 beneficiaries and those with 10,000 or more beneficiaries as \u00e2\u0080\u009clarge\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos, our data indicates that larger acos save significantly more than smaller acos, both in the aggregate and in per beneficiary savings. however, when we compare acos with fewer than 25,000 assigned beneficiaries (\u00e2\u0080\u009csmall\u00e2\u0080\u009d) to those with greater than 25,000 beneficiaries (\u00e2\u0080\u009clarge\u00e2\u0080\u009d), the opposite is true.4 perhaps these data also suggests that the larger an aco is, as defined by number of assigned beneficiaries, the harder it is to achieve shared savings. large acos must manage risk for a greater number of beneficiaries and bring together what is likely a higher number of providers in agreement on how to manage this risk. due to the magnitude of the total cost of care for these acos, prematurely forcing them to take on even a small percentage of risk could result in shared losses that nearly swallow their entire operating margins. we urge cms\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 9 of 25\n\n to seek ways to support these acos, rather than make it harder for them to achieve savings.\n importance of quality improvement to success in the mssp. in its heightened focus on achieving savings, cms overlooks the significant improvements in patient experiences, outcomes and quality of care that all providers have achieved through aco participation. excluding these achievements from the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009csuccess\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the mssp would render any such definitions incomplete and ill-suited to form the basis of significant program change. in our analysis, acos had an average quality score of approximately 92.4 percent in 2017, with a negligible difference between the scores of hospital-affiliated acos and acos without hospital affiliation. this delivery of high-quality health care across providers should be as important to medicare as the achievement of shared savings.\n given that managing hospital care is a key component of improving outcomes and reducing cost growth, hospitals are in an ideal position to contribute to the quality of care that acos deliver. by engaging providers across the care continuum, managing the coordination of care transitions, and driving data sharing within and among provider settings, hospitals play a vital role in improving the quality of care for aco and other beneficiaries. what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, these quality improvements often produce a reduction in health care costs, and thus should be efforts that cms seeks to support. for example, with hospital participation, an aco could more carefully manage transitions out of the hospital to minimize post-hospital care and reduce readmissions, improving patient outcomes and reducing costs.\n risk readiness is not determined by aco composition. using the level of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaptured\u00e2\u0080\u009d revenue as a proxy for the leadership composition of an aco belies the true nature of care delivery in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environment. there is no valid reason to conclude that an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaptured\u00e2\u0080\u009d revenue is an accurate or appropriate predictor of either the amount of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontrol\u00e2\u0080\u009d it has over its beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expenditures or its level of risk preparedness.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 10 of 25\n\n disabilities, end-stage renal disease, and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).5 these individuals also are more likely to have been previously cared for in an emergency department, thereby having higher medicare spending both prior to and during the receipt of ambulatory care. no matter how efficiently hospitals operate, they still have to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and do \u00e2\u0080\u0093 provide complete and medically appropriate care to these more complex individuals.\n similarly, the significant rise in medicare drug spending results in more medicare dollars being paid to hospitals for beneficiaries in its care. however, it does not indicate \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontrol.\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to our research, from 2015 through 2016, medicare spending on all medicare part b separately payable drugs increased more than 7 percent. approximately 96 percent of the growth was due to increases in drug prices and 4 percent was due to increased utilization. during the same time period, spending on outpatient separately payable drugs grew by approximately 11 percent. the price of outpatient separately payable drugs grew at an even higher rate of about 11.28 percent; thus, over 100 percent of the growth during this time was attributable to price increases of outpatient separately payable drugs. the utilization of these drugs decreased over the same period of time. the increase in drug spending from 2015 to 2016 represents about $1 billion in additional spending compared to if no change in price had occurred.\n control does not predict risk preparedness. cms offers no convincing argument to support its assumption that an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontrol\u00e2\u0080\u009d over the medicare expenditures for its assigned beneficiaries indicates that it is more prepared to take on more risk, more quickly, with less experience. indeed, researchers and aco participants are still working to determine what, in fact, does prepare an aco to take on risk. in the experience of our members, some factors that determined their own risk preparedness included:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 tight coordination between hospitals and post-acute providers; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 interdisciplinary management of the aco; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 robust care management in inpatient and outpatient settings; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 significant investment in infrastructure to close gaps in care transitions and coordination; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 investment in data analysis and reporting systems to better target the care each population receives; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 system-wide incentives to manage the total cost of care.\n the amount of time an aco spends in an accountable care arrangement is also a well- documented contributor to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to take on risk and share in savings.6 the risk\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 11 of 25\n\n preparedness of mssp acos also may be influenced by the accountable care contracts with other payers in which the aco participates.7 we urge cms to focus its attention on determining accurate predictors for risk preparedness and revise elements of the mssp based on those factors.\n proposal fails to empower acos to maximize their contribution to patient care and distracts from acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals. making participation more challenging for acos that would be high-revenue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 i.e., those with hospital affiliation, among others \u00e2\u0080\u0093 would marginalize these participants. we are concerned that this could lead to their departure and would squander the significant investments they have made in care coordination and data-sharing before they were able to pay off for the medicare program and its beneficiaries.\n while cms suggests that providers are \u00e2\u0080\u009cwaiting in the wings\u00e2\u0080\u009d to sign up for accountable care, in 2018, only 11.8 percent of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hospitals were participating in the mssp.8 if hospital participation falls \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as cms in fact expects it will \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it would be to the detriment of both patients and the medicare program because they would lose the important contributions of acos that include hospital participants. even under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s methodology, which systematically underestimates shared savings, net program savings were approximately $313 million in performance year 2017. using the more precise methodology of measuring savings against spending that would have occurred had acos not existed reveals the mssp achieved net savings in performance years 2013-2015 of approximately $542 million. in addition, by using new and stronger partnerships across the care continuum to excel on quality measures, hospitals participating in acos also may have impacted the relative quality scores of non- participating hospitals. should hospitals decline to participate in the mssp moving forward, these spillover effects also would disappear.\n we also are concerned that cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal essentially communicates to hospital-led acos that, although they invested more in their programs, they will, nonetheless, face higher hurdles in order to recoup any of it. such a message is a counterintuitive one to send, especially to the hospitals that were early adopters of risk and most prepared to demonstrate that the aco program works. for example, one of our members spent $1.4 million to set up its aco in 2015. it spends an additional $500,000 per year on annual maintenance of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two electronic medical record systems and $1.2 million per year to provide health coaching to beneficiaries on site and via telehealth. this brings its total investment to date to $6.5 million. and, even this aco relied on donated staff time from an even larger health system that helps run the\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 12 of 25\n\n\naco. we would expect that larger acos with multiple hospitals, hundreds of providers, \n and thousands of beds, would spend in the tens of millions to set up their acos and separately, in annual costs to maintain their acos.9\n without hospital participation, the mssp could be left with small pockets of healthy beneficiaries and an overall shift of the medicare program back to siloed operation. but where would this leave the troves of sicker and more complex patients that require hospital care? those beneficiaries would receive primary care in physicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offices, but be sent outside the aco for hospital-based care, likely facing interruptions in care transitions and delays in receiving care as they attempt to navigate the continuum of care on their own. non-aco beneficiaries that receive care in the hospital also would lose the benefit of the spillover effects that result from a hospital redesigning care pathways as part of its aco participation. such a result hardly accelerates the system- wide transition to value-based care that cms is so eager to effectuate.\n instead of making it harder for acos with hospital participants to achieve shared savings, and adding complexity to the mssp with arbitrary distinctions, we urge cms to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfloat all boats\u00e2\u0080\u009d by improving program methodology so that it accurately rewards performance for improving quality and reducing costs. we also urge the agency to offer resources and assistance to all aco participants that are working to redesign care delivery to improve the health of patients. indeed, the experience of acos in other models suggests upfront support increases the likelihood of acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 success. for example, acos in the aco investment model (aim), which was created to help rural providers in the mssp, received $58 million in loans from cms, much of it upfront, and achieved $82 million in net program savings in their first year.\n in addition, we urge cms to conduct in-depth studies of what other practices contribute to success in the mssp, such as infrastructure arrangements and workforce competencies. this information will be essential as cms increasingly expects providers to address community and population health. as acos continue to lead the field in testing out this type of care, we recommend cms encourage their learning efforts and provide them with adequate time and resources to make the changes they find are necessary.\n the aha stands ready to work with cms to identify which program methodologies would enable acos to prepare for risk, achieve shared savings and improve patient outcomes. acos are building momentum and determining the best ways to manage their patient populations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 total cost of care. stability and clarity in the aco program could go a long way in empowering them to do so.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 13 of 25\n\n differentiation of participation options for inexperienced and experienced acos\n in addition to differentiating between high- and low-revenue acos, cms proposes to differentiate between \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos in terms of prior participation with performance-based risk. it would make different participation options available to each group. specifically, cms would identify an aco as experienced with performance-based risk medicare aco initiatives as those that meet either of the following criteria:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the aco is the same legal entity as a current or previous aco that is participating in, or has participated in, a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under a two-sided model; or \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 forty percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or in an aco that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under a two-sided model, in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n as proposed, experienced acos would be required to enter the new mssp at the highest levels of risk (level e of the basic track for low-revenue acos and the enhanced track for high-revenue acos). thus, up to 60 percent of participants in a given aco could be prohibited from entering the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path based on the experience of as few as 40 percent of their co-participants. cms states that this proposal is intended to ensure that acos with \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant\u00e2\u0080\u009d experience with performance-based risk are \u00e2\u0080\u009cappropriately placed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d but in its own example, cms envisions an aco where 20 percent of participants have experience in track 3 and another 20 in the next generation aco model. this situation hardly represents cohesive and consistent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not to mention significant \u00e2\u0080\u0093 experience with a single set of aco methodologies such that it should drive participation options for all 100 percent of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants. therefore, we recommend cms define an \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d aco as one in which at least the majority of aco participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or in an aco that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under a two-sided model, in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 14 of 25\n\n identifying \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos to require that a majority of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in the same performance-based risk medicare aco initiative.\n reduction of time in upside-only risk arrangements\n under the rule, new, inexperienced acos would receive two-and-a-half years in upside- only risk arrangements for agreement periods beginning july 1, 2019, and two years for agreement periods beginning at a later date. inexperienced re-entering or renewing acos would receive a maximum of one-and-a-half years and one year, respectively. experienced acos, as noted above, would be immediately required to take on risk.\n the aha greatly appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow inexperienced re-entering and renewing acos, which include those that are currently participating in track 1 of the mssp, an additional year of upside-only risk. this would allow these acos to gain experience and familiarity with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed changes to the mssp, such as changes to benchmarking and risk adjustment, better preparing them to take on risk in a redesigned mssp. the aha also supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow acos to voluntarily assume more risk and move out of the upside-only levels as they feel prepared to do\nso. \n\n however, we have serious concerns about limiting of new, inexperienced acos to two years in upside-only arrangements. the timing of benchmark notification, data receipt and shared savings determinations under the program render such a short period of time effectively useless to determine if the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care coordination and other redesigns are having the intended effect. in other words, these acos are functionally blind to their financial performance for the entire length of a performance year and into the following year. at a time when aco participants need to determine how to invest any returns or how to alter their care delivery to achieve savings and improve quality, they have no visibility into whether they even have any returns to invest or whether changes they have already made have produced cost reductions or quality gains.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 15 of 25\n\n this proposal would force acos to take on risk without much-needed information, setting many up for failure.\n taking on risk this quickly could be especially difficult for rural providers with low patient volumes and could imperil their ability to participate in the merit based incentive payments system (mips), another vitally important cms value program. participation in any of the current mssp tracks qualifies clinicians and groups to use the mips apm scoring standard in which clinician or group quality and improvement activity scores are tied to their aco. rural providers join acos to contribute to the overall health of their communities, but as non-aco clinicians or groups, they would lack sufficient medicare part b patients or charges to surpass the mips low-volume threshold. without the ability to report mips measures via the mips-apm scoring standard, these acos would likely cease to report mips measures altogether.\n in addition, contrary to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belief that an upside-only track may be encouraging consolidation in the marketplace, we are concerned that the proposal to shorten the time acos can spend in upside-only arrangements would result in the consolidation or departure of acos, especially smaller acos, which do not feel prepared to take on risk after two performance years and one year of performance data. acos allow providers to collaborate without merging to achieve the scale necessary to engage in value-based care. thus, providers can form and join acos to access many benefits they otherwise might have merged to obtain. upside-only acos specifically allow providers that lack the size and sophistication to manage downside risk to engage in value-based care. shortening the time that acos can engage in upside-only arrangements would discourage smaller providers that cannot bear downside risk from joining acos. this would likely lead to more provider consolidation, as some providers may choose to merge with or join an organization that can manage the downside risk in order to access value-based care contracts. and, moving acos to downside risk before they are ready may cause them to perform poorly, which can put small providers out of business or force them to merge or consolidate to survive.\n we recommend that cms allow new, inexperienced acos three years in upside- only risk before requiring them to take on downside risk, but maintain the opportunity for acos that feel ready to elect to move into downside risk prior to completing three performance years. indeed, our recommended three-year upside- only term is supported by aco performance data itself. for example, it is well documented that the longer acos remain in the program, the more likely they are to achieve shared savings.10 evidence demonstrates that per beneficiary savings correlate to experience, especially after acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 third year in the mssp.11 in the experience of one\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 16 of 25\n\n of our members, whose $6.5 million investment to set-up and run its acos for its first three performance years is described above, it took three years to achieve any savings. this aco was only able to achieve savings by making regular adjustments to its care delivery as it learned more and more about its beneficiaries over all three years. and, when the aco did earn savings, it earned $2.1 million, not even a third of their initial investment. if this and other acos had had to take on risk before that crucial third year, they may have declined to participate in the mssp at the outset.\n we also believe that allowing acos to remain in upside-only risk arrangements for a longer period of time would result in more \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not less \u00e2\u0080\u0093 savings to the medicare program. contrary to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assertion in the rule that \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo-sided models perform better over time than one-sided model acos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the 2017 results of the mssp demonstrate that upside-only acos achieved 93 percent of the mssp savings to medicare. it is clear that it takes time to achieve shared savings, and spending a meaningful amount of that time in upside-only risk may actually increase, not decrease, the likelihood of achieving savings.\n levels of risk and reward\n reduction of shared savings rates for acos in upside-only risk arrangements. as part of its glide path to risk, cms proposes to gradually increase the shared savings that acos can achieve. the savings rate would be 25 percent in the upside-only levels, level a and level b. it would gradually increase to 50 percent in level e. however, this is a marked decline from the current up-side only savings rate of 50 percent in track 1 if acos meet certain cost and quality targets. in addition, as figure 1 below illustrates, once cms makes all the calculations that go into determining a shared savings bonus payment, the 50 percent savings rate ends up yielding much less. in this example, the hypothetical \u00e2\u0080\u009camerican aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d has 60,000 medicare beneficiaries and saved $300 per beneficiary, or $18 million in total. of the $18 million saved, cms would keep $10.8 million or 60 percent, and the aco would receive $7.2 million, or 40 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 17 of 25\n\n figure 1 begin here how an aco bonus payment is calculated (track 1, year 2)\n $10,000 per capita benchmark $9,800 per capita minimum savings rate (msr) (2%)\n $9,700 per capita actual spending american aco has 60,000 beneficiaries $300 savings/beneficiary up to 50/50 shared with cms based on quality score quality score = 80% calculate shared savings quality score (80%) x (50% shared savings) = 40% ($300 per beneficiary) x 40% = $120/beneficiary to aco cms receives $300/bene x 60%) = $180/bene cms shared savings bonus ($180/bene) x (60,000 benes) = $10,800,000 aco receives ($120/bene) x (60,000 benes) = $7,200,000\n\n\n in this example, with a 25 percent shared savings rate american aco would receive\n$3.6 million of the $18 million it saved, or 20 percent, and cms would keep $14.4 \n million. reducing the shared savings rate from 50 percent to 25 percent for upside-only acos would result in such low shared savings payments to acos that participation in the program would not be worthwhile for many of them. this is particularly true given the start-up and ongoing annual operational costs of participation, as described above, as well as other program features for which acos carry all of the risk. if acos receive far lower shared savings payments, they will have less capital to invest in caring for their beneficiaries, thereby reducing the potential for future savings to medicare. inexperienced re-entering and renewing acos that established their acos on the expectation that they would share in 50 percent of any savings they achieved and those that have already achieved some savings would face a significant cut to any savings they achieve in the future. we expect some of these acos would exit the program rather than put into care redesign the same amount of work for significantly less potential reward.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 18 of 25\n\n to address these issues, we recommend cms maintain a 50 percent shared savings rate for not only upside-only acos, but also for all levels under the basic track. we also recommend cms continue to allow acos to share in first-dollar savings once the minimum savings rate (msr) is exceeded. additionally, we recommend cms treat the achievement of quality scores as something that deserves reward rather than only something that can reduce shared savings. specifically, we urge cms to use an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality score to award additional shared savings up to a maximum sharing rate of 80 percent for upside-only acos and 90 percent for acos under two-sided risk. currently, the shared savings rates available to mssp acos function as a ceiling; an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality score can only reduce, not increase, that rate. however, given that one of the goals of the mssp is to improve quality and patient outcomes, we urge cms to modify the shared savings methodology to make the shared savings rates floors upon which quality scores can be used to award additional sharing points.\n degree of risk in proposed level e. while we believe the shared savings available to acos on the glide path to risk should begin at a higher rate than as proposed by cms, we recognize and appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to create such a glide path that allows for a gradual introduction of two-sided risk. we believe, however, that the degree of risk that acos in the proposed level e of the basic track would be required to assume should not be based upon the lopsided calculation that cms has proposed. specifically, cms proposes to make the benchmark-based loss sharing limit in level e a percentage point higher than the qpp standards while matching the revenue-based loss sharing limit to the qpp. this proposal would leave almost all acos with only one choice: the benchmark-based standard. acos would have to be extremely low-revenue to make selecting the revenue-based standard worthwhile. under this proposal, a large percentage of aco participants in level e would face a difficult benchmark, which could more intensely disadvantage smaller acos by creating larger swings in their results. thus, we recommend that cms fully align the loss sharing limits in basic level e with the standards for advanced apms under the\nqpp. \n\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 19 of 25\n\n the first four years of an enhanced track agreement period and 3 percent in the final year to arrive at a total of 15 percent.\n extension of agreement period length from three years to five years\n we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to extend the current three-year agreement periods to five years. this proposal will add predictability and stability to the mssp and allow acos a longer time horizon to redesign care in accordance with their experience in the program. given the longer agreement periods, we urge cms to create equally long-term program rules and avoid substantially altering them during the course of acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agreement periods. as acos take on more risk and create more innovative care arrangements, they need reassurance that the rules upon which they base their initial investments will be the same rules under which they will participate in the program. to the degree that acos base participation on modeling of the mssp and other aco programs, midstream changes would potentially leaving them with no option but to exit the programs in which they participate. this became apparent in the next generation program, when cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unilateral, mid-stream change to the risk- adjustment cap resulted in the departure of several next generation acos, including hospitals and health systems that were prepared to take on the high degree of risk next generation requires. as participation in the mssp would become more difficult under the proposals in this rule, it is essential that cms not lose participants due to methodological and other rule changes.\n expansion of access to waivers\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals to expand access to and usefulness of waivers of certain medicare program requirements. we encourage cms to consider adopting additional waivers to allow, for example, funding for transportation and other social services.\n skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule. cms proposes to extend the availability of the snf 3-day rule waiver to acos that elect preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment (assuming they are in a two-sided risk model). cms also proposes that beneficiaries that appear on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cumulative assignment list (that cms would create and update quarterly) at any point during the performance year will be eligible for the snf 3-day rule waiver, even though the beneficiary might not appear on any of that aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subsequent quarterly list updates or might not be finally assigned to the aco during retrospective reconciliation for that year. the aha believes this proposal would address one of the main barriers to using the snf 3-day rule waiver, which is the inability to know who is eligible for it. acos have found it challenging to identify to whom the waiver applies and this proposal will make it easier for them to do so, expanding access to treatment for patients.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 20 of 25\n\n billing and payment for telehealth services. cms proposes regulatory changes for the coverage of approved telehealth services furnished during performance years 2020 and beyond by risk-bearing acos with prospectively assigned beneficiaries. we support these proposals that would expand access to telehealth and protection for beneficiaries receiving care via telehealth, but we continue to urge the agency to more generally and broadly expand medicare coverage and payment for telehealth services. the aha will also continue to urge congress to remove the statutory barriers to increased medicare coverage of telehealth services, including the geographic and practice setting limitations on where medicare beneficiaries may receive telehealth services and the limitations on the types of technology that providers may use to deliver services via telehealth.\n proposed changes to benchmarking methodologies\n risk adjustment of historical benchmark. to better account for changes in beneficiary health status between the historical benchmark period and the performance year, cms proposes to use a single methodology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 cms-hcc prospective risk adjustment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to adjust the historical benchmark for changes in severity and case mix for all assigned beneficiaries, including continuously assigned beneficiaries. the aha strongly supports this proposal and believes it would remove unnecessary complexity from the mssp. additionally, the proposal would reverse the current approach that does not adequately capture changes in continuously assigned beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 health status and would improve the accuracy of acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benchmarks by reflecting the increased or decreased costs of treating these beneficiaries.\n in conjunction with this proposal, cms proposes to place a symmetrical cap of +/- 3 percent on acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk scores over the course of each agreement period. the aha appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow risk scores to rise and fall in conjunction with beneficiary health status. however, a 3 percent cap is too low and the five- year period over which it would be spread is too long. while we recognize the benefit of having a cap on the decrease in risk scores, we do not believe 3 percent will capture the significant beneficiary turnover and changes in health status that aco beneficiaries experience. this is especially true as the burden of illness in the medicare population increases over time. we urge cms to provide the modeling on which it based this proposal so that acos can analyze the same data that cms used and provide recommendations for a higher cap that would still meet the needs of both cms and acos.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 21 of 25\n\n track 3 acos experience today: a constant struggle against an outdated risk score under which they are at risk for a population whose risk score was calculated several years prior. such a situation could create a level of risk some acos cannot bear, deterring them from entering a redesigned mssp program. cms has already recognized the necessity of shorter-term caps on risk and price adjustments; the agency capped trend factor variation in the bpci program on a quarter-over-quarter basis and risk scores in the next generation aco program at 3 percent over two years.\n limiting risk scores to a three percent increase or decrease over five-year agreement periods could also incentivize acos to avoid higher risk patients; this is why insurers that participate in medicare advantage (ma) receive annual premium adjustments based on beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hcc risk scores. cms should look to ma and the experience of acos in other programs to determine the flexibility necessary in risk scores to ensure high acuity patients receive the care they need.\n benchmarking methodology for six-month performance years in 2019. for acos that participate in the jan. 1, 2019 to june 30, 2019 performance year, the july 1, 2019 to\ndec. 31, 2019 performance year, or both, cms proposes to use the full 12 months of \n 2019 to calculate the benchmark and assigned beneficiary expenditures for these acos. cms is concerned that any other approach, including the interim reconciliation approach the agency used with acos in the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial cohorts, would introduce further complexity into program calculations and interrupt program operations. however, this proposal traps acos with a full year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth of risk for beneficiaries that they may have only cared for six months of the year. cms has not provided sufficient justification for why it cannot use the relevant six month periods to calculate acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benchmark and assigned beneficiary expenditures. for these reasons, we oppose this policy and urge cms not to finalize it.\n beneficiary notification requirements\n under current regulations, acos must post informational signs in participant facilities and primary care service delivery settings, and they must provide upon request a written beneficiary information notice, for both of which cms provides templates. cms adopted these requirements in the june 2015 aco final rule in response to concerns from acos that the notification rules in place at the time were too burdensome. however, in this rule, cms again makes proposals that would increase the beneficiary notification burden that aco participants would face. specifically, cms proposes to require aco participants to provide additional information to beneficiaries at the first primary care visit of each performance year, including information about voluntary alignment, the provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation in the mssp, and the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opportunity to decline claims data sharing. this notice would be in addition to the existing requirements detailed above.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 22 of 25\n\n this proposal would add to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 regulatory burden as it relates to beneficiary notices and we are concerned it would cause them to divert important resources away from patient care and to aco operations. we recognize and appreciate the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to provide a template for this notice, but we believe its delivery would add unnecessary complexity to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 operations as they would need to expend resources disseminating this notice to providers and ensuring they disseminate it to patients. the requirement could also complicate individual providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to spend as much time as they can focused on patient care. rather than creating a new notice requirement, we urge cms to considering how to strengthen the existing notifications that acos deliver to beneficiaries.\n election of minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss rate (mlr)\n in its efforts to address \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaming\u00e2\u0080\u009d practices by acos that have taken advantage of the mssp, cms proposes to require acos to select their msr/mlr prior to assuming performance-based risk and to apply this selection for the duration of the agreement period. cms bases this proposal on its concern that allowing acos to change their selection during the course of an agreement period would incentivize acos to learn from their experience in the program and select an msr/mlr that maximizes shared savings or avoid shared losses.\n while we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow acos in two-sided risk arrangements the flexibility to choose their msr/mlr, we urge cms to allow acos to alter their msr/mlr throughout the proposed five-year agreement period. we do not agree that allowing for such changes would leave the mssp vulnerable to gaming; in fact, we believe it would be just the opposite. allowing acos to alter their msr/mlr in accordance with their experience in accepting certain levels of risk would allow acos to continue to advance in operating under performance-based risk, grow the competencies to be successful in the mssp, and build an understanding of the benchmark methodology. this flexibility could increase program participation uptake and retention.\n moreover, even experienced acos would need time to understand the implication of the benchmarking proposals included in this rule. that knowledge would be essential to informing their msr/mlr selection and it may take some years in the program to develop it. additionally, the attributed populations of acos can change significantly over time and as an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed population changes, so does its risk profile. cms recognized this need to allow providers to alter their risk thresholds throughout agreement periods when it allowed bpci participants to change their risk track (or \u00e2\u0080\u009cwinsorization\u00e2\u0080\u009d) levels on a quarterly basis.\n\n\n\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 23 of 25\n\n beneficiary assignment\n election of assignment methodology. to execute certain provisions of the bipartisan budget act of 2018, cms proposes to allow all acos to choose prospective beneficiary assignment or preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation. cms also proposes to allow acos to switch their beneficiary assignment selection on an annual basis. the aha strongly supports these proposals and believes they would bring necessary flexibility to the mssp, especially for acos that operate in areas with high patient churn rates. the ability to choose their assignment methodology would also support acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to manage care as they assume greater levels of risk.\n creation of an opt-in assignment methodology. in addition to providing acos with a choice of assignment, cms considers providing beneficiaries the option to opt-in to assignment to a specific aco. in evaluating possible approaches to operationalizing an opt-in methodology, cms considers a \u00e2\u0080\u009chybrid\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach through which beneficiaries that opt-in or voluntarily align with an aco would be prospectively assigned to that\naco. other beneficiaries would be assigned to that aco only if they receive the \n plurality of their primary care services from the aco and receive at least seven primary care services from one or more aco participants in the aco during the applicable assignment window. cms explains in the rule that the seven service threshold is based upon \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe threshold established by an integrated healthcare system in a prior demonstration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d we urge cms to release additional information on data on the proposed seven-service threshold, as we are concerned that this threshold is too high and could have the unintended consequence of significantly lowering several acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 assigned beneficiary counts. before offering pure opt-in assignment or a hybrid approach, we further urge cms to continue to explore the potential burdens an aco could encounter if beneficiaries are permitted to opt-in to aco assignment and how the option would be explained to beneficiaries.\n definition of primary care used in beneficiary assignment. cms regularly revises the definition of primary care services used to assign beneficiaries to acos. in this rule, cms proposes to include in the definition of primary care services current procedural terminology codes for advance care planning services (99497 and 99498). planning for advanced illness care and end-of-life care is an important element of primary care and we support the addition of these codes to the definition of primary care.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 24 of 25\n\n not to finalize the proposed payment collapse or add-on codes and, thus, not to add them to the definition of primary care services.\n monitoring for financial performance\n to address its belief that current regulations are insufficient to monitor acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 financial performance, cms proposes to monitor acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expenditures. cms proposes that, if expenditures are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a single performance year, the agency could take pre-termination actions. if expenditures are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d for an additional performance year of the same agreement period, cms proposes that it may terminate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation in the mssp.\n this proposal is not a necessary or appropriate mechanism for protecting the medicare trust fund. if acos in two-sided models believe they can achieve savings at some point, it would be more protective for the trust fund to allow them to remain in the program and pay shared losses to cms until then. moreover, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automatic advancement proposal would protect against acos who generate losses remaining in the mssp just to take advantage of waivers and other provisions. as those acos are required to take on increasingly more risk, they themselves would incur too many losses to remain in the program indefinitely. as discussed above, it can take several years for acos to understand their patient population and providers in order to generate savings and at the end of two years, acos barely have a single year of performance data. we do not believe acos would want to invest the millions of dollars required to set up and run an aco if they could be kicked out of the program just 24 months later. there already would be sufficient risk to participants under the proposed redesigned program; the risk of being terminated this quickly could be too much for many acos to bear. we recommend cms consider other approaches for monitoring financial performance, such as the use of corrective action plans, which it already uses as a pre-termination action when an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned population falls below 5,000.\n program data and quality measures\n the aha agrees that acos have a unique opportunity to use aggregate part d data to monitor appropriate use of opioids for their assigned beneficiaries and inform their own and wider opioid misuse prevention efforts. as cms describes in the proposed rule, polypharmacy (or the simultaneous use of multiple drugs by a single patient) increases the risk of adverse events including over-utilization of opioid medications. related issues, like patients having prescriptions from multiple practitioners, exacerbate both over-utilization and diversion of opioid medications. with access to aggregate part d data, acos could better monitor their beneficiaries to prevent these risks. in addition, acos often serve as proving grounds for value-based care programs that can be scaled larger with evidence of effectiveness; if acos are able to stymie opioid misuse through data monitoring, it is possible that non-aco providers may be able to do the same.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 25 of 25\n\n the three opioid use-related measures cms suggests for inclusion in the aco quality measure set seem to be appropriately focused on the right patient population. by specifying that patients of interest would be those without cancer or enrolled in hospice, these measures are less likely to harm patients for whom opioid prescriptions are suitable. in addition, these measures address the major risks associated with opioid diversion\u00e2\u0080\u0094high dosages and multiple prescriptions\u00e2\u0080\u0094rather than an overbroad measure of all opioid prescriptions. the aha appreciates that cms has recommended measures endorsed by the national quality forum (nqf), as nqf-endorsement is an indicator of scientific and statistical validity and reliability.\n however, a number of issues with these particular measures should be addressed before they are used as part of the mssp measure set. first, the measures are nqf-endorsed at the health plan level, and not the aco level. we encourage cms to conduct testing to ensure the measures provide accurate, reliable data at the aco level. the importance of accurate reporting of quality measures is particularly high considering the other proposed changes to the mssp that emphasize taking on more risk.\n furthermore, the purpose of the mssp is to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpromote accountability for a patient population, foster coordination of items and services under medicare parts a and b, encourage investment in infrastructure and redesigned care processes for high-quality and efficient health care service delivery, and promote higher value care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d strictly speaking, the mssp program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purpose is not to test out new measures or address specific epidemics, even though acos provide a logical opportunity to do both. obviously, addressing the opioid crisis is a top priority and accountability and coordination for a patient population necessarily involves addressing medication and drug use. it is unclear, though, how these specific quality measures would interact with the other measures currently used in the program. with these concerns in mind, the aha recommends that these measures be first reported on a voluntary or pay-for- reporting basis rather than associated with shared savings outcomes for the first few years.\n\n\n", "0312": "see

the transformation toward value-based care.\n both legacy organizations, advocate health care, in illinois, and aurora health care, in wisconsin, have been transformative  leaders  and  strong  partners  with  the  federal  government,  state  governments,  and commercial payors in the journey to value. with more than one million value-based lives, advocate has one of the largest accountable care organizations (acos) in the country and is a convener in the new bundled payment for care improvement-advanced (bpci-a) program. aurora was also an early adopter of value-based programs, a successful cjr participant, a successful mssp participant, and now manages a commercial  aco  product  in  which  we  exchange  clinical  data,  co-manage  patient  cases,  and  enhance patient health

the proposed glide path for increased risk in the basic and enhanced track acos, \n but over longer periods of time;\n3. maintaining the current shared savings rate level for acos with one-sided risk; \n\n4. delaying the proposed timeline and start-date for implementation of new mssp contracts; \n\n5. eliminating the proposed distinctions between high-revenue and low-revenue medicare acos to \n ensure a level playing field for all mssp participants;\n6. supporting  improvements  to  risk  adjustment  in  the  benchmark  calculation  methodology, but \n increasing the proposed cap on risk scores to five percent (rather than three percent) during the contract term;\n7. supporting the regional adjustment factor in the benchmark calculation, but with recommended \n removal of aco beneficiaries from the calculation;\n8. supporting  overall  increased  patient  engagement  in  the  aco,  but  without  the  proposed \n beneficiary notification changes;\n9. maintaining the existing mssp beneficiary assignment methodology; \n\n10. opposing the proposed revisions to the early termination process; \n\n11. supporting increased program flexibility, particularly with respect

administrative burden. \n\n our comments reflect our strong desire and commitment to partner effectively with the agency to provide high-quality, cost-efficient care centered on value to medicare beneficiaries.\n\n1. support for a 5-year mssp contract term \n\n advocate aurora health welcomes proposed changes that add stability and predictability to the mssp as we strongly agree with cms that increased stability and predictability will further strengthen the program. as such, we strongly support the proposed transition to a five-year contract term from the current three-year term for mssp participants. the expanded period of time will better enable our aco to effectively implement the clinical care practices and operational efficiencies that lead to the delivery of high-quality, cost-efficient healthcare services for our enrollees. however, as discussed in more detail below, we are very concerned that extending the contract term to five years without also increasing the proposed risk ratio cap on the benchmark to five percent (rather than 3 percent) will adversely impact our ability to achieve success; simply put, our enrollees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk scores on average likely will grow higher than three percentage points over a five year period, making it very challenging for us to achieve spending levels below the benchmark unless cms increases the risk ratio cap to at least five percentage points. recognizing that cms seeks to strengthen and encourage successful participation in the mssp, we strongly recommend that the agency couple the proposed five-year contract term with a five percent risk adjustment cap on the benchmark.\n\n2. support for goal of a glide path toward increased risk for basic and enhanced track acos, \n but over longer

advocate aurora health is very concerned that the proposed two-year period for progression to a two-sided risk model in the proposed mssp basic track is simply insufficient for the development and implementation of the infrastructure necessary for acos to achieve program success. our experience aligns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statements in the proposed rule that mssp participants who have been in the program for longer periods of time generally have achieved greater levels of success.  therefore, we strongly urge cms to allow acos to participate in the program for four years without downside risk before transitioning to two-sided risk. we firmly believe that giving mssp participants sufficient time to learn and effectively implement clinical care and administrative processes will lead to lasting aco success. a four-year period offers acos the experience they require, but also meets cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal of transitioning to two-sided risk within a reasonable timeframe.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 enhanced track acos: cms proposes a significant increase in risk in movement from the basic track level e to the enhanced track. as stated above, more experience enables acos to better understand the clinical practices and administrative processes necessary to deliver high- quality care that improves patient health outcomes in a cost-efficient manner. we are concerned that the proposed transition from basic track level e to the enhanced track represents a significant increase in risk that otherwise successful acos may not want to accept and therefore may deter further participation in the program. therefore, we strongly encourage cms to allow basic track level e mssp participants to remain in basic track level e indefinitely where they will experience meaningful two-sided risk, as well as create additional levels with the basic track or another glide path within the enhanced track toward higher levels of two-sided risk.\n\n3. maintain the current level 50 percent shared savings rate for one-sided acos \n\n advocate aurora very much supports and seeks to contribute to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical policy goal of bolstering the mssp. as such, we are concerned that the proposal to lower the shared savings rate from the current 50 percent to the proposed 25 percent for acos without downside risk will deter providers from participating in the program. a lower level of shared savings simply does not provide the necessary incentive for acos to cover the initial investment costs or incent an aco to move quickly into a downside risk model. therefore, we urge cms to maintain the current 50 percent shared savings rate for acos with no downside risk to ensure more participation and engagement\n\n4. delay the proposed timeline and start-date for new mssp contracts  \n\n advocate aurora health shares cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal of making modifications as appropriate to the mssp that will increase the chances for lasting program success. however, we are very concerned that the agency proposes many significant program changes for implementation under a short timeframe that will be very challenging and burdensome for acos to implement successfully. as such, we respectfully ask cms to delay the proposed july 1, 2019 start date and strongly recommend at least a six-month participant preparation period for the application cycle after publication of the final rule so that participants can adequately prepare and successfully implement any changes adopted in the final rule.\n below we offer several specific examples of the substantial operational challenges and burdens that would arise under a july 1, 2019 start date from our illinois track 1+ aco and its participating providers:\n\n\n 4\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 participant agreements: our track 1+ aco was advised by our cms coordinator to upload participant agreements for the 2019 year on the current 2018 agreement schedule. however, if the proposed july 1, 2019 start date in the proposed rule goes into effect, we are assuming that we will need to re-execute participant agreements again with our aco tax identification numbers (tin).1 the track 1+ aco has more than 800 tins, and executing a new participant agreement within a timeframe of less than six months is burdensome and operationally not feasible for advocate aurora and does not lend itself to a thoughtful, committed process. moreover, and importantly, such work is also frustrating and confusing for our participant providers.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 secondary repayment limits: as a current downside risk model, the track 1+ aco already have a secondary repayment mechanism in place. lack of current guidance on the limits of the secondary repayment or how to execute the secondary repayment from january to july of 2019 causes uncertainty, and will most likely result in extra costs to our aco to change the secondary repayment limits mid-year.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 mid-year start date: the mid-year start date, if implemented, would add confusion and make the program less predictable for our participating providers whose prior experience with the program has been based on full calendar year performance periods.   two of our aco will most likely be responsible for monitoring financial and quality performance for two distinct prospectively assigned populations, which will cause confusion and frustration; especially for the engaged provider monitoring their beneficiaries. we recommend that cms promote more stability and consistency in the program in calendar year program roll out.  rather than a six- month extension, a one-year extension of the current model would allow for providers to prepare and understand changes versus feeling the need to reorganize mid-year and avoid extra burden associated with monitoring two distinct prospectively assigned populations.\n again, these examples illustrate the significant challenges our illinois track 1+ aco and participant providers would face in transitioning to the enhanced track under an accelerated timeframe and a non-calendar year basis. we have very much appreciated the many changes to date that the agency has implemented throughout the medicare program to meaningfully reduce provider burden and allow providers to spend more time with patients.  implementing new mssp contracts under such an accelerated timeframe does not align with the other welcomed reductions in provider burden, as well as the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals of strengthening and stabilizing the mssp. as such, we urge cms to enhance program stability and predictably by delaying implementation of the new mssp contract periods until no earlier than six months after publication of the final rule and on a calendar year cycle.\n\n5. eliminate the proposed high revenue and low revenue aco designations to ensure a level \n playing field for all mssp participants\n advocate aurora health firmly believes that hospital- and physician-led acos have the ability to achieve program success in the mssp. furthermore, our experience very much suggests that, regardless of structure, significant investments are needed in population health platforms and care redesign models for acos to bear risk. therefore, we urge cms to eliminate the proposed distinction between high revenue and low revenue acos and instead ensure a level playing field for all acos participating in the mssp. establishing such distinctions sets up a system that disadvantages hospital-led acos and limits the types of innovations needed to build a high performing healthcare system from which numerous current and future beneficiaries can benefit. it is our experience that the best way to drive high quality of\n\n\n 5\n care for beneficiaries is to create incentives that drive all providers in a system to collaborate and innovate to deliver high-quality, cost-effective healthcare. the goal should rather be to incent all providers to work collaboratively and not disadvantage one aco structure over another. thus, advocate aurora health urges cms to eliminate the proposed distinctions between high revenue and low revenue acos and maintain consistent standards for all mssp participants that foster the provision of more coordinated, high-quality, cost-efficient care.\n\n6. support for improved risk adjustment in the benchmark calculation methodology, but increasing \n the proposed cap to five percent from three percent\n we greatly appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recognition for the need to apply an increase or decrease risk ratio cap in the benchmark calculation methodology over the course an agreement period.  appropriate application of risk adjustment recognizes that the underlying health of a beneficiary population changes over time and, specifically with respect to the mssp, over the course of an agreement period. as such, advocate aurora welcomes cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to incorporate cms-hcc risk scores into the benchmark calculation methodology.\n we are very concerned, however, that the +/- 3% proposed risk adjustment cap is too restrictive and does not allow for clinically appropriate changes in beneficiary risk scores, especially over the proposed extended five-year agreement period. we also understand the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concern about establishing inappropriate incentives to increase aco enrollee risk scores. therefore, to achieve an appropriate balance between acknowledging the changes to the underlying risk of the beneficiary population and discouraging inappropriate coding practices, we strongly encourage cms to consider increasing the proposed cap to +/- 5% cap. adding this meaningful change in risk adjustment will appropriately encourage more providers to remain in and join the mssp.\n in addition, we also wish to express our appreciation and support for cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed elimination in distinction of new and continuously assigned beneficiaries for purposes of risk adjustment. elimination of this distinction provides more transparency into the risk adjustment calculation for mssp participants, enabling us to better understand and achieve success in this program.\n\n7. support for the increased use of regional factors in the benchmark calculation with \n recommended removal of aco beneficiaries from the calculation\n advocate aurora believes the proposed regional adjustment to the mssp benchmark calculation methodology is a step in the right direction. we agree with cms that adding the national benchmarking blend with the regional factor will help mitigate the issue of large market share acos driving the regional benchmark, putting those acos in a position where they are having to compete against themselves. however, we strongly encourage cms to go further with the regional and national benchmark blend to have aco beneficiaries removed from the regional benchmark calculations. therefore, the regional benchmark would compare how acos perform to medicare fee-for- service (ffs) in that region. this would further provide a true comparison of aco costs to the overall region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cost.\n\n8. support for overall increased patient engagement, but without the beneficiary notification \n requirements as proposed\n\n\n 6\n concerns with the proposed beneficiary notification at the first primary care visit of the performance year, including the following:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 unsuccessful as a prior requirement: this proposed requirement was previously a requirement of participation in the mssp. however, cms removed the requirement because directly notifying beneficiaries resulted in tremendous beneficiary confusion. it was our experience that the beneficiary notice on average resulted in an additional ten minutes per visit just so that the provider or staff could explain the template letter. the template letter was not beneficiary friendly and was not written at an appropriate literacy level. this resulted in further confusion, and many beneficiaries became overwhelmingly concerned that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgovernment\u00e2\u0080\u009d had their data, asking to opt-out of data sharing, which limited the aco from receiving the data that would improve and better coordinate beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 care.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increased provider burden: implementing the proposed requirement would require providers to reformat their electronic medical record (emr) systems to include reminder prompts and documentation templates for sharing the beneficiary notice, all of which increase financial and administrative burdens for providers that would need to implement and enhance their emr system.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 defining a primary care visit: primary care visits are very loosely defined in the mssp program, assuming step 1 and step 2 attribution are used to define primary care visits. this methodology includes many specialists that do not traditionally identify as a primary care and therefore would make compliance with this proposed requirement very difficult and confusing for the provider to meet. therefore, we would urge cms to consider using traditional primary care specialties (e.g. family medicine, internal medicine, and geriatrics) to define primary care visits in order for acos to comply with the proposed requirement should cms ultimately adopt it in the final rule.\n furthermore, we commend cms for wanting to take a more beneficiary-centric approach toward aco participation. however, we strongly encourage cms to provide acos with more flexibility to provide relevant beneficiary engagement outreach. for example, we recommend acos have the ability to conduct and promote annual wellness visits, cancer screenings, or a diabetes follow-up, that correspond with the aco quality program. the outreach should also be disseminated in a manner of the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice, email for example, if this is more convenient for the beneficiary. as currently defined in the marketing guidance, beneficiary engagement is very limiting and prohibits the aco from being able to support individual providers in engaging beneficiaries in a meaningful way.\n\n9. maintain the existing mssp beneficiary assignment methodology  \n\n\n\n 7\n changes to the mssp assignment methodology, we urge cms to test alternative approaches in smaller models in a variety of markets to determine whether they meet programmatic goals.\n\n10. recommendation against proposed revisions to early program termination policies \n\n advocate aurora does not support the proposed early termination policy based on spending related to shared savings and loss for 2+ years. we understand the sentiment for early termination based on 2+ years of losses, especially if the aco is not showing improvement.  however, early termination based on shared savings seems arbitrary and minimizes the integrity of the program, as the point of the mssp program is for acos to continue to lower costs and receive shared savings. further, to assist and help acos succeed and achieve shared savings or lower costs, we encourage cms to make the program data and results more transparent and timely so that acos can actively monitor their performance in more real time to manage costs and provide high quality care.\n\n11. support for increased program flexibility, particularly with respect to the provision of telehealth \n services\n we appreciate the proposed expansion of the payment rule waivers, especially the telehealth waiver. such waiver enables our acos to use innovative delivery methods to provide high-quality, cost-efficient care to enrollees. these waivers represent the types of changes that will contribute to the long-term success of the mssp.\n advocate aurora recently piloted virtual visits with other capitated contracts, and as we evaluate the expansion of these capabilities, reimbursement for different services that can be provided virtually will only increase our ability to provide our beneficiaries greater access to care in a lower cost setting. we support and commend cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus to increase access to telehealth services and encourage the agency to continue pursuing similar policies that promote innovative technology to improve access to care.\n\n12. support for quality-related proposals that will lead to improved patient health outcomes \n\n advocate aurora supports the reduction of the aco measure set proposed in the rule. such changes reduce burden and improve efficiency for providers and therefore we welcome them as proposed. moreover, we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement to more outcome based quality measures.  these measures drive improvements in care that lead to improved patient health outcomes.\n further, we support cms providing acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 aggregated data on opioid use. however, we also encourage cms to go further and provide all medication use and substance use diagnoses aggregated data for beneficiaries. currently this information is removed from the aco data and we believe that it is important to monitor for the total health of beneficiaries.\n\n\n 8\n than dosage when determining the most appropriate metrics to help address and respond to the opioid epidemic.\n\n13. support for the removal of the aco-11 measure \n\n we greatly appreciate the removal of the aco-11 measure related to certified ehr technology (cehrt) attestation for the mssp program in the proposed rule. we believe an attestation to evaluate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of cehrt not only reduces burden on providers but also aligns with the requirements of other advance alternative payment models and we greatly appreciate the consistency.\n however, the proposed rule is unclear if basic levels a-d would still be required to comply with promoting interoperability requirements for merit-based incentive payment system (mips) purposes. we urge cms to clarify whether acos subject to the mips would not be required to report promoting interoperability (pi) data and would instead see pi performance category weights redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories.\n conclusion\n again,  we  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  provide  our  feedback. advocate aurora is  committed  to working  with  policymakers  at  all  levels  of  government  to  promote  and  preserve  the  health  of  the individuals, families, and communities of illinois and wisconsin, and to advance innovation in health care delivery to ensure quality and improve outcomes for all who are served by the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care system. advocate aurora appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts and we stand ready to be a resource to the agency as you work to alleviate regulatory burdens and improve the marketplace to improve access and lower cost of care for individuals, families, providers, and the nation.\n please do not hesitate to contact meghan woltman, vice

assisted living communities, sub-acute centers and homes for individuals with intellectual and development disabilities. our skilled nursing facility (snf) members provide care to approximately 1.7 million residents and patients each year.\n\n with such a membership base, the association represents the majority of snfs and a rapidly growing number of assisted living communities. by delivering solutions for quality care, ahca/ncal aims to improve the lives of the millions of frail, elderly, and individuals with disabilities who receive long term or post-acute care in our member facilities each day. we provide high value and quality care for seniors with complex health care conditions, comorbidities, and functional deficits that require highly specialized care.\n\n we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the mssp \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3pathways to success\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 proposed rule (the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3proposed rule\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096).\n\n key recommendations\n ahca is well-positioned to provide meaningful recommendations to cms because we represent more than 13,600 skilled nursing centers, assisted living communities, sub- acute centers and homes, many of which have deep experience with accountable care organizations (acos). through our members \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00bfexperience, we have become well-versed in the dynamics between acos and post-acute care providers and believe we can offer a unique perspective with actionable

recommendations for aco refinement and improvement to ensure that acos provide the highest quality of care to some of medicare\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s neediest beneficiaries.\n\n e improve communication and coordination between acos and snfs: we believe that acos will achieve better quality, financial, and patient outcomes with improved communication and coordination with snfs. nursing facilities are a key stakeholder in the shared savings program and should therefore have guidance by and support from the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) in the form of improved waiver access, clinical guidelines, and greater interoperability.\n\n e structure financial alignment between acos and downstream providers: as acos and other providers coordinate care, we believe it is important to ensure appropriate financial alignment between providers. as such, we recommend that cms provide guidance on gainsharing arrangements between acos and snfs.\n\n e refine aco measurements: in general, we believe there are opportunities for improvements to aco measurements and structures. specifically, we recommend that cms improve its risk-adjustment methodology to account for snf utilization and select quality measures that are data-driven, impactful, and aligned across payers.\n\n below, we provide more in-depth and specific recommendations related to each of the overarching points, above.\n\n specific recommendations\n snf 3-day waiver\n cms proposes to allow the use of the snf 3-day waiver for any aco in a downside risk track of the basic track or the enhanced track, regardless of beneficiary assignment methodology. cms also proposes to allow critical access hospitals (cahs) and rural hospitals operating under a swing bed arrangement to be eligible for the snf 3-day waiver. ahca supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 decision to provide greater access to the waiver.\n however, we believe there are also opportunities for further improvement.\n\n ahca recommends that cms allow snfs to apply for and \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3own\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 the waiver, rather than requiring that acos apply for and maintain the waiver. we believe this will reduce confusion and administrative burden for acos, snf affiliates and the beneficiaries they serve. the 3-day waiver is important because it allows patients to receive the appropriate level of care at the right time, and we believe this will increase access to and use of the waiver.\n\n ahca recommends that cms allow waiver access to all aco tracks, irrespective of risk. any medicare beneficiary assigned to an aco should automatically be afforded the ability to waive the 3-day stay requirement. we believe it is important for all patients, regardless of their assignment to a risk-bearing or non-risk-bearing aco, to have the opportunity to avoid unnecessary time in the hospital and receive appropriate care. in\n addition, by allowing more providers to use the waiver, unnecessary costs to the healthcare system will be reduced. the snf 3-day requirement is an outdated regulatory burden which increases health care spending and reduces quality of care. as stated above, we believe this waiver allows patients to receive care in the most appropriate setting, resulting in cost reductions from eliminating or reducing hospital stays preceding snf admissions and should therefore be granted to more providers in effort to improve overall quality of care.\n\n ahca also requests that cms create equal eligibility requirements for all snfs, cahs, and rural hospitals with a swing bed arrangement. first, we believe that if cahs participate in the waiver, a 3-star requirement should apply, like the 3-star requirement for snfs. alternatively, if no comparable cah rating system exists, cms should limit cah use of the waiver to only those cahs truly located in rural areas experiencing snf access issues. the intent of the cah certification is to ensure access to care in rural communities. as such, cahs must meet two location-related requirements: 1) they must be located at least a certain distance from hospitals and other cahs; and 2) they must be located in rural areas. however, according to a recent department of health and human services office of inspector general report, nearly two-thirds of cahs would not meet the rural location requirements if required to re- enroll.! it is important to provide equal and fair assessment to all facilities and to have an appropriate quality standard in place. to that end, ahca also urges cms to re-evaluate the appropriateness of the 3-star requirement for waiver eligibility. second, we believe that the star rating system does not provide a comprehensive representation of snf quality and should not be the sole requirement for snf waiver eligibility. cms should implement an exceptions process for snfs who temporarily drop below 3 stars so they can continue to utilize the waiver. many of our member snfs have dropped below 3 stars at some point due to technical issues with the ratings requirements and not because of change quality performance. it is also essential that cms address the appropriateness of 3-star threshold when future changes are made to the star rating system that follow the publication of the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3pathways to success\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 final rule.\n\n in addition, while the star rating system incorporates risk adjustment for the individual metrics involved in the star rating system, no adjustment is applied to the weight of long stay and short stay quality measures when calculating a quality rating. short stay measures and long stay measures are weighted equally, even if a facility has considerably more medicaid long stay volume. this has led to inequality among providers that have higher long stay volume than short stay volume. for mssp acos, an accurate depiction of short stay quality is particularly important. a recent analysis also found that \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3there can be no nationally consistent process for assigning star ratings, since the most significant contributors to the ratings are the state-level inspections, which are conducted by separate sets of inspectors within each state, using protocols for which there is no

(ccsq) to take these issues into consideration when revising the star rating system so that medicare payers, beneficiaries, and upstream and downstream providers are provided with accurate information about snf quality.\n\n creating flexibility within the criteria for snfs will allow snfs that provide high-quality care to benefit from the waiver. in addition, an improved rating system will avoid the penalization of snfs that provide high-quality care but are subject to an inaccurate or insignificant drop in star ratings that have no relation to quality and patient outcomes.\n\n ahca appreciates cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 continued refinements of the snf 3-day waiver in the shared savings program and believes that this waiver, with the appropriate access and requirements, will have an even more meaningful impact on the quality and costs of care.\n\n aco transition to risk clinical guidelines\n cms proposes to replace mssp tracks | and 2 with the new basic track, which would require downside risk beginning in year three. mssp track 3 would be replaced by the new enhanced track but maintain the same risk requirements. ahca supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 decision to require acos to transition to downside risk and cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 broad goal to transition more providers to downside risk. however, as acos transition to risk and drive cost reduction strategies, providers across different care settings must discuss and coordinate clinical guidelines to ensure appropriate patient care. we have heard from countless members that many acos simply require snfs to reduce length-of-stay (los)\n and if facilities do not meet acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 demands, snfs will be removed from the post-acute network, regardless of patient outcomes or potential rehospitalizations. as such, we believe there should be guidelines on los requirements for different types of patients in the snf. premature discharges can result in rehospitalizations, worse patient outcomes, and increased costs to the system, which should be avoided. therefore, we urge cms to: (1) monitor snf utilization by acos and the associated impact on rehospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality; and (2) create formal guidelines on appropriate care protocols and los requirements for aco patients in the snf.\n specifically, cms should point out to acos medicare beneficiaries have the right to a statutorily defined snf benefit found at 42 u.s. code \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 1395i\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b63, requirements for, and assuring quality of care in, skilled nursing facilities. while we respect the need to develop new approaches to efficiency in

the use of gainsharing and other financial arrangements between acos and downstream providers. as cms has noted, acos achieve financial savings largely because of reduced snf spending. however, snfs experience aggressive aco actions, including the dictation of medical practice, required reductions in los, and other interferences with snf operations. as such, to reward snf behavior and cooperation with acos, we believe acos should compensate snfs in keeping with proportion of savings snfs achieve for acos while maintaining quality outcomes. we recommend that cms create gainsharing guidelines for acos and snfs, whereby snfs receive financial benefit from improved outcomes and aco savings. ahca believes it is important to create the proper financial incentives for acos and their downstream partners, so providers are properly rewarded for efficient and effective care. with the proper incentives in place for acos and downstream providers, we believe cms would create incentives for acos in the shared savings program to work with snfs in order to achieve medicare savings and quality rather than using inappropriate utilization controls discussed above. in regard, gainsharing guidelines could reinforce the use of best practices and clinical practice guidelines (e.g., medication assessment and reconciliation).\n\n of serious concern, some of our members have entered into financial agreements with acos and worked to improve patient care and reduce costs, often by putting significant dollars at risk. however, in some cases, acos have violated the terms of these contracts and providers have no avenue to voice and/or address these violations without fear of retaliation. providers have indicated a broad-reaching fear any legal action will result in termination of contracts or loss of preferred provider status. we request that cms add a provision to the mssp regulations at 42 cfr \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 425.116(b) to protect the right of aco providers/suppliers to take remedial action against an aco for violating contractual obligations related to the care of mssp beneficiaries. providers must have access to meaningful avenues to communicate questions, concerns, or violations. in addition, we believe cms should incorporate provider satisfaction metrics in their evaluation of acos.\n\n apm safeguards\n the shift from ffs to apms and managed care has revealed a myriad of challenges for providers and beneficiaries, creating significant barriers to beneficiary access and choice.\n as acos and other alternative payment models (apms) transition to risk, we believe cms must ensure patient access, provider flexibility, and coordination of services. as such, ahca recommends that cms consider the following apm safeguards in future aco and apm refinement and development:\n\n\n1. the model must place the medical management of post-acute care with post-acute\n care providers;\n\n2. the model must preserve a patient\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s freedom of choice of provider;\n\n the model must not restrict guaranteed medicare benefits to medicare beneficiaries;\n\n4. the model must allow providers the flexibility to deliver patient-centered care (e.g.,\n improving the current 3-star requirement for the snf 3-day waiver) in order to achieve the patient\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s highest practicable level of function and outcome;\n ww\n\n5. the model must not inadvertently create access barriers for patients with complex or\n chronic diseases; and\n\n6. model savings should come from more efficient delivery of services and care\n coordination, rather than from summarily truncating lengths of stay or shifting the site of care.\n\n ahca requests that cms take the above apm safeguards into consideration when refining acos and other apms. we believe these safeguards will improve patient access, care coordination, and quality outcomes.\n\n beneficiary assignment\n cms proposes to remove the exclusion of claims including the pos code 31 for the aco assignment methodology and instead exclude services billed under cpt codes 99304 \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 99318 when these services are furnished in a snf based on an analysis of facility-level claims data. ahca commends cms for this proposed change and believes this will result in improved patient attribution.\n\n however, our members are concerned that acos often do not provide snfs with information about attributed aco beneficiaries when entering the nursing facility. as a result, this can lead to disjointed care, poor patient experience, and unnecessary burden on the snf. some of our member snfs have been forced to bear the full financial cost of a beneficiary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s snf stay due to incorrect information provided to them by the aco.\n ahca recommends that cms require acos to enhance communication and interoperability of electronic health records with snfs. we believe that improving the dissemination of electronic health records among providers will result in improved coordination of services and reduced inefficiencies as patients transition from one care setting to another. this communication must occur in a timely fashion, often in real time, to provide necessary care to aco beneficiaries. recently, cms highlighted its commitment to improving interoperability in the healthcare system, so we believe our recommendation for acos to share electronic health information with snfs aligns with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 goal of improved interoperability and will result in improved services.\n\n benchmark formation\n cms proposes to incorporate regional fee-for-service (ffs) expenditures when establishing an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s historical benchmark in the first agreement period. in addition, cms proposes to reduce the weight of regional adjustments from 70% to 50% and cap the regional adjustment by a flat dollar amount equal to 5% of national medicare ffs per capita expenditures. furthermore, cms proposes to use the cms-hcc prospective risk scores to adjust the historical benchmark based on changes in severity and case mix for all assigned beneficiaries, subject to a 3% positive or negative symmetrical cap for all agreement periods beginning july 1, 2019.\n\n ahca supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to incorporate regional expenditures into acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 historical benchmarks, however, ahca is concerned with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 methodology to calculate hcc risk scores. specifically, we are concerned with the fact that hcc scores\n do not accurately predict spending or utilization in snfs. because snfs have such a large role in the shared savings program, we recommend that cms refine its hcc risk adjustment methodology to account for the unique characteristics and needs of the snf population. a key to success in the shared savings program is accurate and reliable financial benchmarks, which is why it is vital to improve the methodology and ensure accurate and stable benchmarks. we believe a risk adjustment methodology that takes this into consideration will ultimately aide in the formation of a fair and reliable aco benchmark.\n\n quality measures\n cms seeks comments on quality measures per the meaningful measures initiative.\n within the current mssp measure set, ahca supports the continuation of the pneumococcal vaccination quality measure. in addition, as cms refines the mssp measure set, we believe that regardless of which quality measures are used, the following principles should be considered for quality measure selection. specifically, quality measures need:\n\n\n1. to reflect the primary goals of care for the population receiving care;\n\n\n2. to be meaningful to the consumer and provider;\n\n\n3. to be more heavily weighted for patient outcome measures than structure or process\n measures, particularly when used in p4p of vbp programs;\n\n4. to be risk adjusted to account for differences in patient populations and acuity\n (preferably by use of regression modeling not just through a set of exclusions);\n\n5. to use structure and process measures (if outcome measures are not available) that\n have an association with improved outcomes;\n\n6. to help achieve better outcomes (e.g., results reflect recent care delivery and can be\n used in quality improvement efforts such as qapi);\n\n7. to be readily available for use now or are under development to be used in the near\n future; and\n 8. to be based on data and measure specifications that are in the public domain.\n\n furthermore, beyond principles for quality measure selection, we believe quality measures should also reflect goals of care. as such, we recommend that cms consider the following goals when selecting quality measures for the mssp:\n\n\n1. return patients to their prior living situation or the most independent and least\n institutional setting practical as quickly as possible;\n\n2. avoid unnecessary rehospitalizations;\n\n\n3. improve patient function, particularly related to mobility, self-care (e.g., activities of\n daily living, or adls), and speech;\n\n4. improve patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 clinical conditions (e.g., wound healing, post-surgical recovery,\n\netc.);\n\n\n5. complete patient course of treatment for an episode of illness that requires skilled\n nursing care (e.g., [v medications such as antibiotics); and\n\n6. educate beneficiaries on how to better manage chronic disease(s) or disability (e.g.,\n transitioning to successful self- administration of medications)\n\n finally, we recognize the need to ensure that quality measures are built on the same criteria across payers and providers to avoid different kinds of rehospitalization measures and other quality measures, which result in provider confusion. accordingly, we urge cms to ensure quality measure alignment across payers. we believe quality measure alignment will allow providers to more easily manage quality measure performance and achieve high quality scores across different models and programs, while reducing administrative burden and costs.\n\n we applaud cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 commitment to the shared savings program and the continued refinement of various program components. in addition, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the mssp \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3pathways to success\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 proposed rule.\n\n if you have questions about any of our comments,

nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest faith-based, nonprofit health care systems, texas health resources (texas  health)  provides  more than  350  points  of  access throughout  north texas,  including  29 hospitals (acute-care, short-stay, behavioral health, rehabilitation and transitional care) and more than  100  outpatient  facilities,  satellite  emergency  rooms,  surgery  centers,  behavioral  health facilities, fitness centers and imaging centers. the system also includes a large physician group, home health, preventive and well-being services as well as more than 250 clinics and physician offices to provide the full continuum of care for all stages of life.  texas health appreciates the opportunity  to comment  on  the  centers  for  medicare and medicaid  services\u00e2\u0080\u0099  (cms) medicare shared savings program (mssp) pathways to success proposed rule.\n texas health appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued commitment to accountable care organizations (acos). medicare acos have been successful in reducing healthcare costs and improving quality.  the recent  mssp  pathways  to  success  proposed  rule  estimates  that  the  overall  impact  of  acos, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cspillover effects\u00e2\u0080\u009d on medicare spending outside of the aco program, lowered spending by  $1.8\u00e2\u0080\u0093$4.2  billion  (0.5\u00e2\u0080\u00931.2  percent)  in  2016  alone.  additionally,  when  assessing  the counterfactual, comparing acos performance in comparison to what medicare spending would have otherwise been, acos estimate savings are approximately 2 percent higher1.  for example, peer-reviewed studies found that the mssp saved more than $200 million in 2013 and 2014 and $144.6 million in 2015 after accounting for shared savings bonuses earned by acos2.  a similar study  found  that  acos  saved  $1.84  billion  from  2013  through  2015  and  reduced  medicare spending by $542 million after accounting for shared savings bonuses3.  texas health supports the aco model as a successful approach for encouraging providers to work together to reduce costs and improve the quality of healthcare for medicare beneficiaries.\n supporting  the  movement  to  these  value-based  payment  models  goes  beyond  the  quality  and financial  results  of  acos.  from  a  market  perspective,  we  will  never  achieve  innovation  in healthcare except through the creative power of healthcare providers seeking to innovate the care delivery process.  models in which payers seek to achieve savings and quality improvement will\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 2 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970 always fall short until healthcare providers themselves are held accountable for the results.  we have seen firsthand the remarkable innovations that are spurred by this accountability such as those in telehealth, the hospital in the home, special care centers, organizing community support organizations and systematically addressing the social determinates of health.\n the pathways to success establishes a step-wise approach for acos increasingly taking on more downside  risk.  we  agree that  it  is  imperative  that  over  time  providers  become  increasingly responsible for total cost of care through risk-bearing agreements; however, cms must ensure providers have proper tools and experience to achieve this vision.  we believe that with proper incentives and improvements in the program organizations will take on risk, seeing the quality, clinical  innovation  and  business  benefit  from  doing  so.  specifically,  cms  should  consider  the following within the context of mssp and any new payment models:\n sufficient time in an upside-only model prior to moving to downside risk.  acos are more likely to achieve shared savings with time.  specifically, studies show that the shared savings rate doubles with three years of experience from 21 percent for acos in the first year to over 40 percent for acos in the third of fourth year4.  accordingly, texas health recommends at least three years in an upside only model for new acos entering the mssp.  beyond the mssp program, we believe it is imperative for cms to provide a long-term vision and roadmap for the transition to value-based and risk-based models.  in the absence of a clear timeline, some providers are reluctant to embark on new models.  when providers have a clear plan for moving to new models (e.g. the maryland all-payer model), providers work aggressively to succeed in the model and more rapidly advance to the risk-bearing model.\n high performers should be encouraged to participate in models regardless of provider type. the mssp performance data summarizes average aco performance, masking differences among high and low performers within each category.  we strongly discourage the application of policies targeting provider types that are intended to modify the behavior of the lowest performers; these policies impact high and low performers, thereby disincentivizing high performers from continuing in the model and producing savings.  specifically, we request that cms eliminate the distinction of high and low revenue acos and avoid creating new blunt tools to define acos (e.g. physician-led and hospital-led).  in any payment model cms should create a level competitive playing field and let those that perform best succeed most.  cms should find non-provider defined approaches to eliminate poor performers.\n ensure a business case for taking on risk.  cms must ensure that acos and new payment models, particularly voluntary models, provide incentives for taking on risk.  the existing models to date have ignored the significant investment costs required to start or continue participation in a model.  even when these costs are not incorporated into the payment model, providers will consider potential  return  on  investment  when  determining  whether  to  enter  a  new  model.  cms  must recognize this dynamic and ensure that acos and other models will attract providers. specifically, cms should: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increase the shared savings rate for acos to at least 50 percent. as discussed below reducing the savings rate prevents acos from recouping initial investments, reinvesting savings into population health activities, and recruiting providers with the use of gainsharing agreements. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 support providers in achieving faster learning. as a participating organization of premier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aco collaborative, texas health has greatly outpaced the nation. making up just six percent of all medicare acos, the premier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population health management collaborative acos generated\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 3 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970 20 percent of the program savings since 2012. in fact, if all medicare acos performed at the level of premier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population health management collaborative acos, medicare could have doubled its savings since 2012 to $4 billion. premier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collaborative uses data, best practice sharing and hands-on performance improvement support to achieve this superior performance. we believe that cms should invest in facilitating learning networks where acos learn best practices from the leading acos. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 provide additionally flexibility in the models for acos taking on risk. to be best suited to take on  more  risk,  within  an  aco  or  any  payment  mode,  and  effectively  manage  the  care  of populations providers require flexibility. while beneficial, the current approaches to providing flexibility  (e.g.  snf  and telehealth  waivers,  beneficiary  incentive  program)  represent  limited portions of medicare benefits and thus limited opportunities for transforming care. within the next  generation  aco  model  cms  incorporated  several  options  that  provide  flexibility  and should be considered for inclusion in the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0094choice on enrolling tin or npi, infrastructure payment,  prepayment  of  shared  savings  and  primary  capitation.  similarly,  cms  should consider aspects of medicare advantage that could be incorporated into acos. while ma is a capitated full-risk model, providers would benefit from the flexibilities in performance-based risk models.  specifically,  cms  should  consider  incorporating  utilization  management  into  acos and expanding on the beneficiary incentive payment by incorporating aspects of the ma value- based  insurance  design  (vbid)  model,  allowing  acos  to  offer  supplemental  benefits  or reduced cost sharing to aligned beneficiaries with specified chronic conditions, focused on the services that are of highest clinical value to them.\n redesigning participation options to facilitate performance-based risk phase-in of performance-based risk in the basic track cms proposes to redesign the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance-based risk tracks by retiring track 1 (no risk, upside only) and track 2 and creating a new basic track.  in the basic track, participants could begin  participation  in  a  one-sided  risk  model  and  phase-in  risk over  the  course  of  a  single agreement period; the highest level of risk is comparable to the current track 1+.  additionally, the proposed rule retains track 3, renaming it as the enhanced track.  eligible acos would enter into these two tracks for an agreement period of 5 years (the first agreement period, if stated in july 2019 would be 5 years and 6 months).  within the basic track, cms proposes a glide path that  includes  5  levels:  a  one-sided  risk  model  available  only  for  the  first  two  consecutive performance years (levels a & b), and three levels of progressively higher risk and potential reward in performance years 3 through 5 of the agreement period (levels c, d, and e).  acos would automatically advance at the start of each participation years along this glide path until they reach the track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maximum level of risk/reward (designed to be the same as the track 1+ model).\n texas health supports an agreement period of at least five years, as we believe that this adds  stability  to  the  program.  we  have concerns,  however,  that  the  progression  cms proposes  to  two-sided  risk  in  the  basic  track  is  far  too  aggressive  and  will  deter participation in the mssp.  we believe that the two years in a one-sided risk model is insufficient for acos to prepare for moving to downside risk.  numerous studies show that acos require about 3-4 years to become successful.5  this is not surprising given that acos receive feedback on their performance several months into their first agreement period\u00e2\u0080\u0095any initiatives designed to improve performance always take more time than anticipated, and this is particularly true for the complex organizations  and  agreements  that  comprise  an  aco.  organizations  need  time  to  make  the structural, cultural, and practice changes required to successfully manage and assume financial risk for a population.  in recognition of the time required for acos to be successful, cms should\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 4 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970 allow at least three years of no-downside risk within the basic track to ensure the success of participating acos and encourage future participation.  cms should extend an optional fourth year in a one-sided track for acos that achieve savings, not necessarily shared savings, and have high quality.\n shared savings rate\n texas health urges cms to set the entry-level risk for the basic track at 50 percent with gradual increases in the shared-savings rate as acos progress through the various levels. lowering the shared-savings rate for acos with no downside risk from 50 percent to 25 percent provides little incentive for new acos to join the program.  the low shared-savings rate also does not consider the substantial investment needed on the part of acos.  according to an analysis by the american hospital association (aha), the investment required to put in place and sustain the elements necessary for a successful aco has been $11.6 to $26.1 million higher than previous estimates by cms.  these costs, coupled with the cost of having a repayment mechanism in place to cover losses, creates a high hurdle for organizations who are transitioning to accountable care.\n the proposed shared savings rate is a significant decrease for existing acos, which will be unable to  reinvest  savings  back  into  population  management  and  care  coordination.  shared  savings payments  are  critical  as  part  of  an  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  transformation  toward  value-based  care  and  are necessary to incentivize providers to make the infrastructure investments needed to transform care delivery and processes.  without them, acos will struggle to provide care and services needed to appropriately manage the health of the population and move more rapidly to risk, undermining the overall  goal  of  the  program.  reducing  shared  savings  also  produces  problems  with  provider participation and aco buy-in, as some organizations already find this difficult at current shared savings level.  to incentivize acos to take on risk, cms should increase the shared-savings rates as they take on additional risk.  we recommend increasing the shared savings by five percent with each step: levels  a/b: 50 percent; levels c/d: 55 percent; and level e: 60 percent.\n calculation of loss sharing limit\n texas health supports using the lower of the revenue-based or historical benchmark for calculation of the loss sharing limit.  however, we recommend that cms align the risk level for track e with the nominal risk threshold for  apm models established under the qpp, which  is three percent  of  the  historical  benchmark,  rather  than  the four percent  cms proposes.  cms provides no rationale for setting the benchmark-based loss limit at the nominal risk standard plus one percentage point.  the purpose of track e is to provide aco entities with a more  gradual  pathway  to  risk,  while  also  meeting  the  requirements  of  an  aapm.  setting  the historical-benchmark  at  a  higher  level  would  disproportionately  affect  acos  with  hospital participants  and  subject  them  to  additional  risk  as  they  will  always  use  the  historical-based benchmark since medicare part a and b revenue will far exceed the historic-based benchmark. accordingly, increasing the benchmark-based loss limit creates an unlevel playing field for acos that include hospital participants.  this proposed policy is counter to the goal of acos to encourage providers to work together to improve care for beneficiaries and discourages both health-system led and physician-led acos from recruiting hospital participants.\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 5 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970\n transition from level e to enhanced track texas health urges cms to create additional levels within the enhanced track to build a more gradual transition from level e to enhanced.  as proposed, many acos would not be eligible for the basic track or able to renew within the basic track for a second agreement period and would only have the option to enroll in the enhanced track.  cms should either build a glide path to the highest risk level within the enhanced track or offer an additional track to help bridge the  gap  between  the  basic  and  enhanced  tracks.  to  further  maximize  interest  in  acos transitioning to the enhacned track, cms should start the shared savings rate to 80 percent (same  as  the  next  generation  aco  program)  and  increase  the  maximum  shared  savings  and losses rate over the agreement period.\n permitting annual participation elections annual risk election cms proposes to allow acos in the basic track to more rapidly transition (i.e., skip a level or levels) during the agreement period, but level e must be entered into no later than the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth performance year under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal.  texas health encourages cms to provide acos with more flexibility in their annual participation elections.  if an aco selects a higher level of risk  than  it  would  have  been  automatically  assigned,  it  should  not  be  required  to automatically advance the following year (i.e., an aco is not required to advance beyond the track they would have been assigned if they did not choose to advance to a higher track). as noted earlier, acos require additional time moving to risk.  this option would provide acos the option to gain experience in a limited risk track for more than one year.  additionally, we ask that cms consider allowing high performing acos more than one year in limited risk tracks (i.e. level c and d); cms could set parameters for successful acos to continue in a particular track prior to automatic advancing (i.e. achieving savings, not necessarily shared savings, and high quality).\n annual election of beneficiary assignment\n in alignment with the bipartisan budget act of 2018, cms proposes to allow all acos with a choice of prospective assignment for the agreement periods beginning july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years.  as proposed, acos would also be able to change its beneficiary assignment methodology through the annual election process.  texas health strongly supports this change that would allow  acos  the  option  of  choosing  prospective  beneficiary  assignment  or  prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation.  this would provide acos with flexibility to better manage their patient populations based on their unique circumstances.  certain acos, such as a small aco that is worried about dropping below the 5,000-beneficiary threshold, may favor a model where the aco can add beneficiaries throughout the year, and would thus prefer the retrospective assignment model.  other acos would likely prefer a prospective model, which would help them stabilize their beneficiary population.  the prospective approach also allows more advanced acos to employ data analysis and beneficiary engagement techniques from the start of the performance period on a population for whom they they are responsible.\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 6 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970 higher risk than low revenue acos. cms provides fewer participation options for high revenue acos.  high  revenue  acos  with  \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d  can  only  participate  in  the  enhanced  track regardless of whether they are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cre-entering\u00e2\u0080\u009d the program.  in addition, low revenue (and inexperienced) acos may operate under the basic track for a maximum of two agreement periods, whereas high revenue acos are limited to one agreement period.\n texas  health opposes  this  proposal  and  urges  cms  to  eliminate  the  low/high  revenue distinction for determining participation options.  we firmly believe that all acos should the  treated  the  same.  this  proposed  distinction  is  unnecessary  and  harmful,  as  it  would discourage  acos  that  have  the  potential  to  generate  substantial  savings  to  the  program  from participating.  the  premise  cms  uses  for  hospital-led  versus  physician-led  distinction  is  also flawed.  cms argues that this policy decision is due in part to low revenue acos producing 2 percent of savings compared to 0.2 percent for high-revenue acos.  a premier, inc. analysis of hospital-led vs. physician-led acos revealed two-major findings that refute this assumption: an analysis of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 definition of hospital-led (the aco includes a hospital tin participant) found that it is inaccurate with at least 20 percent of health system-led acos being designated as

acos?\n cms argues that many low-revenue acos are not well-capitalized and therefore unable to absorb losses as well as high-revenue acos.  regardless of structure, significant investments are needed in population health platforms and care process changes for acos to bear risk. medicare revenue is also not indicative of ability to bear risk.  cms is unable to identify if an aco is well capitalized through sources outside of medicare revenue (i.e., insurer or investor backed acos).  accordingly, cms  is  unable  to  truly  identify  whether  an  aco  is  well  capitalized  and  thus  should  not  create distinctions based on assumptions about capital. setting up a system that disadvantages hospital- led acos limits the types of innovations needed to build a high performing healthcare system for the range of communities across the nation.\n cms makes a flawed assumption that acos, in some cases, encourage harmful consolidation in the marketplace.  the biggest driver of consolidation is the incessant payment cuts on providers by public payers.  health care systems and hospitals need to consolidate to manage against these cuts and improve efficiency.  moreover, consolidation is occurring across the healthcare industry for  many reasons  and  is  not  necessarily  negative.  providers  and  other  healthcare  entities  are seeking  to  develop  high-value  care  networks  that  break  down  the  artificial  silos  that  cause duplicative, fragmented patient care.  acos do not drive physician employment, but rather, acos support  greater  clinical  integration  and  collaboration  among  doctors,  hospitals  and  other  care providers and align the payment system to incent coordination and cost savings across these silos. this alignment accomplishes what the model is designed to do, and what providers need out of high-value networks, without necessitating employment of physicians.  some of the most effective acos  in  premier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  population  health  collaborative  engage most independent  clinicians.  the greatest fear related to consolidation is its potential to lead to higher prices.  ultimately, the only way to protect against escalating costs is to advance these alternative payment models that hold providers accountable and give them the opportunity to improve care and reduce costs for an entire population.\n\nms.

should require a hospital participant and other providers across the care continuum to ensure that acos do not simply keep patients  away  from  a  particular  setting  but  ensure  patients  receive  care  in  the  least  restrictive setting.  while it would be absurd to define what providers an aco must include it is equally absurd to say that acos that work to include multiple provider types should be forced to risk sooner.\n we believe that healthy market competition relies on a level playing field.  this administration has been outspoken in advocating for market solutions and level playing fields among competitors. this proposed policy, however, is contrary to a market-based approach whereby all competitors have similar opportunities for success.  whenever there is an uneven playing field, one competitor will use it to their advantage over another.  alternatively, competitors can take steps to game the system.  advantaging one group over another can also create perverse incentives to undermine a competitor overall.\n defining participation options by \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms  also  proposes  to  limit  participations  options  by  categorizing  acos  as  \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d  or \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d  with  performance-based  risk  medicare  aco  initiatives  and  determining participation options based on prior participation of aco legal entity and aco participants.  cms defines a \u00e2\u0080\u009cre-entering aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d as (1) the same legal entity as an aco, identified by tin, or a (2) new legal entity that has never participated in the mssp and is applying to participate in the program and more than 50 percent of its aco participants were included on the aco participant list.  cms defines an experienced aco that meets either of the following criteria: (1) the aco is the same legal  entity  as  a  current  or  previous  aco  that  is  participating  in,  or  has  participated  in,  a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under track 2 or track 3; or (2) 40 percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or in an aco that deferred its entry  into  a  mssp  agreement  period  under  track  2  or  track  3,  in  any  of  the  5  most  recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n texas health supports the participation options based on prior participation and definitions of renewing/re-entering acos and the 50 percent threshold.  we generally support the cms definition of experienced, but urge cms to increase the threshold from 40 percent to 50 percent to align with the new/re-entering definition.  we also encourage cms to monitor the impact of this policy and consider creating an appeals process.  for example, it is possible that two separate acos discontinue operation in a region then a new entity, completely unaffiliated with either prior entity, forms in the region and recruit participants involved in the prior organization.  the intent of the policy is to avoid gaming of the options for the glidepath not to discourage new entities. to balance this potential outcome, cms should also consider a second criterion, setting a threshold for a percentage of participants that previously were in the same entity.  for example, cms would first identify if 50 percent of participants would qualify aco to be reentering or experienced; then if less than 30 percent of participants were part of the same legal entity then the aco could appeal the label of reentering or experienced.\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 8 of 15\n 612 e. lamar

program and generate net losses to medicare.\n texas health opposes the cms proposal to terminate acos if negative outside corridor for two  agreement  periods.  we  believe  that  these  additional  provisions,  if  implemented,  would provide  cms  with  too much  discretion to  terminate  aco  participation  in  the  program.  we are concerned  that  such  unchecked  authority  provided  to  cms  would  further  discourage  acos participating in the mssp, as this would create additional uncertainty for participants and would also make it difficult to establish agreements with other organizations.  moreover, cms proposals with respect to the glide path that would limit participation in one-sided risk models would also provide acos with incentives to leave the program if they were not able to generate savings.\n election of minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss rate (mlr) by acos cms proposes that acos under the basic track would have the same msr/mlr options that are currently available to acos under one-sided and two-side models of the mssp.  acos under the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path in level a or level b would choose the msr/mlr to be applied before the start of their first performance year in a two-sided model. cms also proposes to use a variable msr/mlr when performing shared savings and shared losses if an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population falls below 5,000 for the performance year, regardless of whether the aco selected a fixed  or  variable  msr/mlr.  texas  health supports  these  proposals  and  appreciates  the flexibility these options provide to meet acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs.\n participation options for agreement periods beginning in 2019 cms proposes to offer a july 1, 2019 start date as the initial opportunity for acos to enter an agreement period under the basic or enhanced track.  as proposed, acos that entered a first or  second  agreement  period  with  a  start  date  of  january  1,  2016,  may  elect  to  extend  their agreement period for an optional fourth performance year, defined as the six-month period from january 1, 2019 through june 30, 2019.  cms notes that this election to extend the agreement period is voluntary and an aco could therefore conclude its participation in the program with the expiration of its current agreement period on december 31, 2018.\n texas health is concerned that this policy will result in an aco managing the costs and quality of two  separate  beneficiary  populations.  each  six-month  performance  period  has  two  distinct assignment  windows  and  methodologies.  moreover,  if  an  aco  changes  its  participant  lists between the six-month extension and the start of the new model, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aligned beneficiaries could be significantly different.  while some beneficiaries will be attributed to the aco for both performance periods, there will be a portion of an acos beneficiary that are attributed for only one performance period.  for beneficiaries attributed for only the first performance period, the aco will have to continue to deploy resources to manage this population after they are no longer aligned with the aco and the aco is unable to take advantage of the waivers available in the program. for beneficiaries attributed only in the second performance period, the aco will be responsible for costs incurred in the first half of the year when the aco had no ability to manage the beneficiaries care.\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 9 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd.,

provide a july 1, 2019 start date option for new and existing acos.  at a minimum, cms should use a singular assignment window and methodology  to  determine  the  assigned  population  for  the  entire  calendar  year  2019, regardless of whether they are in an extended agreement or the new model.\n finally, texas  health  is concerned  that  implementation  issues  could  arise  if  cms  rushes  the application process, so we urge cms to ensure that there is enough time for cms and participants to prepare for an application cycle after the final rule.  we respectfully request that cms delay the july  1,  2019  start  and  offer  a  one-year  extension  to  all  current  acos  who  are  ending  their agreements if cms is not ready to implement a new model.\n benchmarking methodology refinements risk adjustment methodology texas health appreciates the risk adjustment refinements cms proposes that would eliminate the distinction of newly and continuously aligned beneficiaries for purposes of risk adjustment.  this appropriately  recognizes that risk scores should increase  or  decrease  during the  course  of the agreement period and that the beneficiary population underlying health changes with time.  we urge cms, however, to raise the cap as +/- 3 percent is too restrictive; +/- 5 percent would more accurately account for changes in risk over a performance period.  ideally, cms should provide additional incentives for acos to move to higher risk levels by providing additional flexibility in accounting for the risk of the population.  this could be accomplished by allowing the cap to increase as acos take on additional risk.  level e in the basic track, for example, would have a higher cap than levels c and d.  we also believe that the cap for the enhanced track should align with the percentage change in risk scores for ma plans.\n use of regional factors when establishing and resetting aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmarks cms proposes to incorporate regional expenditures into the benchmarking methodology for acos in a first agreement period for all acos entering the program beginning on july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years.  under current policy, the maximum weight applied to the regional adjustment is 70 percent.  cms proposes policies that would limit the magnitude of the adjustment by reducing the weight (to a maximum of 50 percent) and imposing an absolute dollar limit on the adjustment (capped at 5 percent of the national per capita expenditures for parts a and b services in baseline year 3 for assignable beneficiaries).\n texas health supports the cms proposal to incorporate the regional adjustment into the initial agreement period.  we do not support lowering the regional contribution to below 50 percent and urge cms to maintain the current maximum contribution of 70 percent.  as such we recommend the following schedule of weights to be applied:\n schedule of weights for regional adjustment timing when subject to regional adjustment aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical spending is lower than its region aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical spending is higher than its region first time 30% 25% second time 50% 35%

waiver can be requested only by those mssp acos that bear performance-based risk and to whom beneficiaries are prospectively assigned.  cms proposes to expand the waiver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s applicability beginning july 1, 2019, to include performance-risk bearing acos that  utilize  preliminary  prospective  beneficiary  assignment.    in  all  cases,  the  snf  must  be  an eligible affiliate of the aco and, in most cases, have a rating of three stars or better in the cms five-star snf quality rating system (cms also is proposing to allow swing bed operators, who are  not  included  in  the  star  rating  system,  to  become  eligible  snf  affiliates).   the  waiver  is available currently to track 3 and track 1+ acos; the proposed expansion would include track 2, basic track levels c, d, and e and the enhanced track.  texas health supports the proposed expansion of snf three-day rule waiver applicability as another important tool with which acos  can  more  effectively  coordinate  care  while  increasing  quality  and  reducing unnecessary costs.\n telehealth waiver expansion in keeping with the provisions of the bipartisan budget act of 2018, cms proposes that existing originating site and geographic restrictions would be waived when medicare-approved telehealth services are furnished to ffs beneficiaries by mssp aco professionals.  the waiver would take effect beginning with performance year 2020 and be limited to those acos that bear performance- based risk and to whom beneficiaries are prospectively assigned.  the services must be billed through the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tin and may not be designated as inpatient-only.  the expanded telehealth policy would apply to track 3 and to track 1+ acos as well as to those on the newly proposed enhanced track and on levels c, d, and e of the basic track.  we support the telehealth expansion as proposed, particularly when combined with the increased flexibility that would occur with the proposed ability for acos to annually elect either prospective or preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment.\n other needed waivers additional waivers are critical to removing persistent legal and regulatory barriers that inhibit mssp aco providers from working together to provide better-coordinated, high-quality care, most notably pertaining to the applicable fraud and abuse laws (e.g., the stark and anti-kickback statutes and the beneficiary inducements civil monetary penalty (cmp) provisions).  texas health continues to recommend that cms should allow: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2

therefore, to effectively deliver value-based care, acos must seek to actively engage the beneficiaries for whom they will be held accountable for quality and cost, yet mssp acos are prohibited from marketing activities, such as those permitted for medicare advantage (ma) plans.  current regulations do allow acos to provide in-kind items or services as incentives, the propriety of which are judged on a case-by-case basis, but acos are inhibited by the simultaneously applicable statutes (e.g., anti-kickback and cmp provisions).  the bipartisan  budget  act  of  2018 enables  performance-based  risk-bearing  acos  to  establish incentive  payment  programs  to  encourage  their  assigned  beneficiaries  to  obtain  medically necessary  primary  care  services,  beginning  no  later  than  january  1,  2020.    cms  proposes implementing  regulations,  including  aco  eligibility  and  incentive  program  application  and certification processes, with a start date of july 1, 2019 (coinciding with the first agreement period of the redesigned aco tracks).  cms also addresses beneficiary eligibility, primary care services that  would  qualify  for  incentive  payments,  and  incentive  program  recordkeeping,  along  with payment amount, timing, and distribution method.\n texas  health appreciates  that  the  regulations  proposed  by  cms  to  implement  the  beneficiary incentive payment program as directed by bipartisan budget act of 2018, are not overly restrictive and are attentive to minimizing provider and beneficiary burden.   given longstanding concerns about compliance of aco incentive programs with applicable fraud and abuse laws, texas health requests that cms provide template language for use by acos to notify beneficiaries about their new incentive programs.  finally, since establishing a primary care incentive payment program is optional for acos, we recommend that cms make available summary information  about  the  uptake  of  beneficiary  incentive  programs  when  reporting  overall mssp results.  information from early adopters of incentive programs would be valuable to the remaining acos when making their decisions about applying to establish incentive programs.\n beneficiary notifications cms requires that mssp acos notify beneficiaries that their care is being furnished under a shared savings payment model and that they may opt out of having identifiable, claims-level data about themselves  shared  with  their  acos.  cms  has  modified  the  content,  frequency  and  delivery mechanisms  for  beneficiary  notification  multiple  times  since  the  mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  inception.  currently, notices must be posted in acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 primary care delivery sites and a written beneficiary information notice must be provided upon beneficiary request.  cms proposes to expand the requirements beginning july 1, 2019, creating a cms template notice, designed to be a comprehensive single source of mssp information that must be given to beneficiaries during their first primary care visit of each performance year.   cms further proposes to add material to the revised notice informing beneficiaries of their option to voluntarily designate an aco professional to coordinate their care\n(i.e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary clinician\u00e2\u0080\u009d

is unlikely either to be retained or to be readily retrieved later when needed. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 prior  similar  requirements  for  expanded  notifications  during  primary  care  visits  led  to considerable confusion among beneficiaries; for example, some beneficiaries believed that the data-sharing notification was in reality an attempt by the aco to steal their identities. many acos had to reassign staff members from clinical duties to answering beneficiary questions about various notification provisions. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 clinical  workflows  and  electronic  record  systems  would  require  reconfiguration  (e.g., scheduling  additional  visit  time,  incorporating  reminder  prompts  and  documentation  of notification delivery) to assure that the required notifications occurred at the time of the initial primary care visit of each performance year. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 beneficiaries should be able to specify how information is most effectively exchanged with them by cms and by their acos (e.g., hard copy, 1-800-medicare, electronic mail).\n texas health recommends that no changes be made to the current notification processes regarding  the  shared  savings  payment  model,  aco  participation  by  a  beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practitioners, and opting out of beneficiary identifiable, claims-level data-sharing.   we also recommend that notification about voluntary alignment be presented separately, in keeping with the bipartisan budget act of 2018 provisions designed to support access to this choice by beneficiaries and the potential of this option to directly increase beneficiary engagement. we also recommend that mssp aco beneficiary user groups be created and that no new or revised notifications be implemented without input from those groups; their input should also guide delivery method choices made available to beneficiaries for various notifications.\n opt-in assignment methodology cms  discusses  at  length  and  invites  comments  about  all  aspects  of  a  hybrid  assignment methodology that would include direct aco opt in (a beneficiary chooses assignment to a specific aco);  voluntary  alignment  with  an  aco  professional  (with  resulting  assignment to the  aco  in which that professional participates); and, a modification of the current claims-based assignment methodology (incorporating a minimum level of primary care visits furnished to a beneficiary).  cms does not make any formal proposal about the hybrid methodology nor indicate a timeline for further consideration of its implementation.\n we appreciate  that  cms  is  exploring  the  potential  for  opt-in  assignment  to  increase  aco beneficiary engagement that then could lead to more effective care coordination with improved quality and decreased costs.   texas health does not support implementation of the hybrid opt-in methodology as discussed in the rule at this time.  instead, we recommend that cms do the following: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 maintain the existing claims-based methodology combined with the voluntary alignment option (and minimizing the notification burden related to that option); \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 expeditiously test an option for beneficiary opt-in directly to an aco (in parallel to the existing beneficiary  voluntary  alignment  directly  to  an  aco  professional). testing should  explore appropriate marketing opportunities for acos analogous to those for ma plans; and, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 explore additional approaches hybrid assignment and choose one or more for limited-scale testing before proposing any program-wide replacement mssp assignment methodology, cms should  explore  rules  for  rejecting  opt-in  or  voluntary  assignment  (e.g.  when  a  beneficiary resides outside

care practitioner or practice one of a limited list of specialties (e.g., cardiology), and the beneficiary must have received at least one primary care service from a professional who practices primary care or a listed specialty in the aligned aco.  as part of bipartisan budget act of 2018 implementation, cms  proposes  policy  revisions  to  begin  with  performance  year  2019  including  removing  the specialty restrictions to primary clinician eligibility and no longer requiring the voluntarily aligned beneficiary  to  have  received  any  services  from  a  professional  in  the

century cures act and bipartisan budget act of 2018, for performance years 2019 and thereafter cms proposes to update the definition of primary care services that is used when assigning beneficiaries to acos (in combination with the applicable mssp track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assignment methodology).  services that would satisfy the revised definition include some  existing  current  procedural terminology  (cpt) codes  (e.g.,  advance  care  planning)  and healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) g-codes (e.g., depression screening) along with new g-codes proposed elsewhere in the rule (e.g., complexity inherent in office visits for  certain  specialties).  cms  also  proposes  to  more  accurately  distinguish  short-term, rehabilitation-related  evaluation  and  management  services  provided  in  nursing  facilities  from ongoing  primary  care  services  furnished  to  longer-term  nursing  facility  residents.    cms  would identify the former services by linking the appropriate cpt codes to nursing facility claims for the same dates of service rather than relying on the place of service code for snfs (code 31) as listed on the professional claim.   texas health supports the proposed changes and agrees with cms that linking snf facility claims by date of service to professional claims will better identify short-term, rehabilitation-focused care that should not be counted as primary care services that contribute to beneficiary assignment to acos.\n extreme and uncontrollable circumstances in december 2017, cms issued an interim final rule with comment

united states.  as a result, medicare drug event records now constitute a substantial and critically important repository of substance use disorder data.  cms currently provides part d prescription drug event data to each aco on a monthly basis, but items potentially related to substance use disorders  are  routinely  de-identified,  provided  only  in  aggregate,  or  both.    acos  are  held accountable for the total health of their beneficiary populations, but the ability of acos to most effectively  manage  population  health  is  being  increasingly  constrained  by  the  limited  and  non- specific  substance  disorder  data  with  which  they  are  provided.    many  beneficiaries  are  taking multiple medications and are at high risk for adverse drug interactions when opioids are prescribed for them.  we believe that it is unfair to hold acos accountable for measures of substance use disorder management until cms provides acos with access to the data necessary for instituting  appropriate  treatment  (i.e.,  complete  and  identifiable  data  for  all  prescribed medications and their related diagnoses).\n in support of optimizing population health management by mssp acos, including substance use disorders, texas health continues to advocate for statutory reform of 42 cfr part 2 (confidentiality of substance use disorder patient records) to make substance use data more readily available to providers who are already subject to hipaa patient privacy protection regulations.  until part 2 reform  is  enacted, we  again  strongly  recommend that  providers  who  are  engaged  in population health management (e.g. acos) and that are bound by a data use agreement with cms, receive complete and identifiable data from cms about substance use disorder- -related diagnoses and services furnished to their assigned beneficiaries by providers to whom part 2 does not apply.\n cms further states that over one-third of beneficiaries assigned to mssp acos with continuous part d coverage have at least one opioid prescription but that rates vary substantially across acos (10-60%).   we believe that such variability strongly suggests opportunities to improve the quality of  care  for  substance  use  disorders  in  many  acos.   assuming  that  cms  makes  sufficient beneficiary medication data available, we generally support consideration by cms of adding opioid use measures to the mssp measure set.  in particular, however, we oppose addition of measures that focus primarily on opioid dosing (e.g., nqf #2951 use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer).  we are concerned that rigid adherence to dosing guidelines (e.g., the centers for disease control & prevention guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain) may cause serious adverse outcomes (e.g., depression, suicide) for  patients  being  successfully  managed  on  long-term  opioid  analgesics  whose  dosing regimens are

scoring standard.  we request that cms avoid creating confusion by confirming that clinicians in acos that are mips apms would not be subject to full pi category reporting and scoring but instead could simply certify their cehrt usage.  the pi category weight for such  clinicians  would  then  be  redistributed  equally  to  the  quality  and  clinical  practice improvement activities performance categories.\n pharmacy care coordination: request for comments texas health supports cms exploring approaches that could facilitate collaboration between acos and part d stand-alone prescription drug plan sponsors and lead to improved outcomes, such as more  widespread  use  of  medication therapy  management.  cms  should  investigate ways  to make complete pharmacy data more readily available to mssp acos and their clinicians. particular  attention  should  be  given  to  enabling  technology  methods  (e.g.,  secure  data  access portals, data sets accessible using application programming interfaces) that could provide acos with  real-time  access  to  claims  data  (prior  to  or  synchronous  with  claims  processing)  for their aligned beneficiaries.  real-time access would allow acos to build provider alert processes that would improve care by triggering rapid clinical interventions when needed, as is being done already by some ma and commercial plans.\n cms should develop one or more voluntary mssp demonstrations that incorporate aco accountability for part d costs.  doing so would allow those acos who are ready and interested to participate, would accelerate progress towards readiness by the remaining acos, and would provide a platform for testing multiple approaches, the most effective of which could be expanded to all acos.  maximizing flexibility should be a guiding principle in designing such demonstrations; for example, allowing acos to select patient cohorts for whom to be responsible (e.g., high-risk patients with diabetes or patients with multiple chronic conditions)\n overall, texas health is committed success of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 alternative payment models and encourage cms to consider models beyond acos.  specifically, we recommend cms consider adopting a \u00e2\u0080\u009clayered payment model\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a provider-driven aco model that includes primary care capitation as well as inpatient and outpatient bundles within a global capitated amount along with legal waivers that will allow providers to employ tools similar to ma plans.  additionally, we urge cms to test a provider-driven  global  capitation  models;  for  example,  a  model  aligned  with  h.r.  5841  as introduced by congressmen mike kelly and richard neale during the 114th congress.\n in closing, texas health resources appreciates the opportunity to share our comments on the comprehensive proposed rule.  if we can provide you with additional information, please do not hesitate to contact dr.

program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pathways to success proposed rule dear administrator verma, steward health care system llc (\"steware) is a fully integrated, physician-led national health care services organization committed to providing the highest quality of care in the most cost- efficient manner in the communities where our patients live. steward \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the largest privately held health care company in the u.s. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 owns and operates 34 community hospitals across nine states, serves over 1,000 distinct communities and employs approximately 40,000 health care professionals. in addition to our hospitals, the steward provider network includes 4,800 providers, 25 urgent care centers, 87 preferred skilled nursing facilities, substantial behavioral health offerings, over 7,300 hospital beds under management, and approximately 1.5 million full risk covered lives through the company's managed care and health insurance services. steward's integrated care network projects reaching three million risk members in 2019, inclusive of nearly 200,000 medicare beneficiaries in a medicare accountable care organization (aco) model. we appreciate the opportunity to respond to the proposed changes to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) medicare shared savings program (mssp). since joining the pioneer aco demonstration model in 2011 as one of the first in the nation, steward has shared in cms' commitment to advance innovative reimbursement and care delivery models. through participation in models such as the pioneer aco and next generation aco (ngaco), steward has delivered coordinated, high quality, cost-efficient health care services to medicare beneficiaries. steward strongly supports cms' proposed new direction which would encourage a faster transition to two-sided risk models. steward has long advocated for models of care that include both upside and downside risk. in particular, we support the following changes as outlined in the proposed rule:\na. \u0000 increasing levels of up- and downside risk over a five-year contract period. \n\nb. additional beneficiary alignment and engagement tools previously unavailable to mssp \n acos.\nc. hcc risk adjustment methodology similar to what is currently in place for the ngaco \n program, although further modernization is necessary (see \"accurate risk adjustmene). in addition to the proposed changes, we offer cms the following recommendations, borne out of our extensive experience in aco programs across all payers: prospective global capitation model we strongly believe that the addition of a prospective, global capitation model to the cms aco portfolio would build on the work and progress of the current aco models and help providers better coordinate patient care and improve health outcomes. physicians currently participating in acos (e.g. mssp or ngaco) bill cms for services under fee-for-service and undergo a performance reconciliation at the end of the year. this model, however, suffers from a unique case of a mal-alignment phenomenon: a single physician (pcp or specialist) can frequently earn higher marginal returns, by charging for volume rather than relying on the aco returns (i.e. value); \"hurtine the performance of all, since he/she accrues all benefits but shares the burden with the network. for example, physicians may recommend an unnecessary exam if the benefit accruing to themselves is greater than the loss accruing to themselves via the\naco. this is value-based care on a volume-based chassis and does not lead to sustainable change. \n prospective global capitation payments overcome this mal-alignment phenomenon. in addition, prospective global capitation payments allow providers to fund and incorporate population health programs that holistically address patient needs across the care continuum, while reducing total cost of care and improving quality. when providers are paid under a prospective globally capitated payment system, they can overcome budgetary timing issues to fund activities that are typically excluded from the traditional fee-for-service system, such as:\na. system infrastructure, including development of health information technology to improve \n access to care and care coordination,\nb. social determinants of health and patient connections to community organizations, \n\nc. wellness and prevention programs, and \n\nd. behavioral health integration. \n we urge cmmi to add a prospective, globally capitated payment model to the medicare aco portfolio that includes:\na. prospective, capitated payments directly from cms. \n\nb. accountability for high quality, efficient care under medicare part a and medicare part b, \n at a minimum.\nc. upside and downside risk associated with managing a medicare population's total cost of \n care, not just sharing in the savings.\nd. proactive beneficiary enrollment as an option,

america\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health insurance plans (ahip) is writing on behalf of our members in response to the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) notice of proposed rulemaking for the medicare shared savings program (mssp). ahip is the national trade association representing health insurance plans. our members provide health and supplemental benefits through employer-sponsored coverage, the individual insurance market, and public programs such as medicare and medicaid. ahip advocates for public policies that expand access to affordable health care coverage to all americans through a competitive marketplace that fosters choice, quality, and innovation.\n according to the health care payment learning & action network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (lan) most recent survey, medicare advantage (ma) has the most care in value-based arrangements (41 percent) across insurance market sectors, including in medicare fee-for-service (ffs).1  per the figure 1 below, commercial plans lead the way in creation of accountable care organizations (acos) with a little over half of the aco contracts in 2018, and each contract averaging 24,300 lives versus 17,500 under medicare.2\n 1 http://hcp-lan.org/workproducts/apm-measurement-final.pdf 2 david muhlestein, robert saunders, robert richards, and mark mcclellan, recent progress in the value journey: growth of acos and value-based payment models in 2018, health affairs blog.\n\n october 16, 2018 page 2\n\n\n\n\n figure 1. accountable care contracts over time\n\n\n\n\n many of the providers with whom our members have such arrangements also serve medicare ffs patients through mssp contracts. we find that aligning incentives, both cost and quality, across payers serves to create synergies that advance the respective programs further and faster. this is one reason ahip partners with cms on the core quality measure collaborative that seeks to align measures across public and private payer contracts, including a core measure set specifically for use in assessing acos and medical homes. providers with aligned multi-payer models are subject to less burden and can dispense with hedge strategies, allowing them to dive head long into transformation. thus, a stable and successful mssp program is crucial to the ongoing success of private sector models as well.\n our specific comments are based on the extensive experience of our member health plans implementing acos and other alternative payment models (apms) and are focused on the following areas:\n october 16, 2018 page 3\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 redesigning participation options, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 refining the benchmarking methodology, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 providing tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 enhancing fee-for-service benefits, and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 updating program policies.\n redesigning participation options\n cms proposes to discontinue track 1, track 2 and future applications for track 1+ mssp models. in their place, cms proposed to crease two new tracks: a basic track, which incorporates elements of the current track 1+ model, and an enhanced track based on the current track 3 model.\n in the future, cms should conduct a formal evaluation, in addition to the public use file, of the mssp and share it with stakeholders in advance of rulemaking to aid in the preparation of comments.\n basic track\n transition timing\n the basic track includes a path towards progressively higher increments of risk and potential reward. the glide path includes 5 levels:  a one-sided model available only for the first two years to eligible acos and three levels of progressively higher risk and potential reward in years 3 through 5 of the agreement period.\n we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 effort to simplify the participation options and establish a clear path to provider risk-bearing models. we agree that it is important for providers, once ready, to accept financial risk to encourage success and protect against possible increased spending. our members report that it commonly takes 3 to 4 years of non-risk bearing models prior to the providers being adequately equipped to manage risk. thus, while the existing 6 years may be too generous, declining to two years may be overly ambitious. even if providers are not immediately taking on programmatic risk, they are taking on other forms of business risk. a sufficient glidepath is key to encouraging organizations to embark on the arduous journey of delivery system transformation and turn away from the ffs incentive to drive volume.\n october 16, 2018 page 4\n outcomes in care. a 2017 health and human services (hhs) office of inspector general report found that acos achieved high quality and noted progress on important measures including reduced hospital readmissions and screening beneficiaries for risk of falling and depression. 3  it is this foundational change that we see pay dividends in out years. an analysis by avalere of the 2017 mssp results finds that acos in the program for at least 3 years performed better than newer acos as displayed below in figure 2. acos with 1-2 years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experience in the program increased medicare spending. given the very modest average savings in year 3, and that providers may not surpass the minimum savings rate, it is understandable that they would be hesitant to accept risk in that year.\n figure 2: net reduction in medicare spending per beneficiary by aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number of years in program\n\n moreover, enhanced risk does not inherently equal heightened results. in 2017, track 1 acos outperformed the risk-bearing tracks two to one in terms of average savings per beneficiary according to analyses by the national association of acos using the cms public use file displayed in table 1 below.\n\n october 16, 2018 page 5\n table 1: net savings for acos based on track\n track net savings to medicare (millions)* mean savings per beneficiary percent acos generating savings track 1 $290 $138 33% track 2/3 $23 $55 51% *net savings factors in bonuses paid to acos\n cms must strike a delicate balance between program improvements that will drive additional savings and robust participation in the program. we urge cms to allow for three years of the up-side only model rather than the proposed two years to encourage new entrants.\n sharing rate\n cms proposes an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maximum shared savings rate would be 25 percent, based on quality performance, during the one-sided model years. the glide path concludes with a maximum 50 percent sharing rate and a maximum level of risk of 30 percent capped at either 8 percent of an acos revenue or 4 percent of the benchmark. this final level of risk under level e would qualify as an advanced alternative payment model (apm) for purposes of the quality payment program (qpp).\n cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal would reduce the sharing rate by 50 percent compared to its current level. our members, in working with providers to establish acos, find that there are significant investments required in the early phase. thus, a 25 percent sharing rate is not likely to provide the necessary return on investment to precipitate entry into the program.  ahip and its members urge cms to maintain the existing 50 percent sharing rate as a minimum and grow the sharing rate as the providers progress to risk.\n loss rate\n october 16, 2018 page 6\n\n level advancement\n acos in the basic track glide path would be automatically advanced at the start of each performance year along the progression of risk/reward levels or could elect to move more quickly to a higher level of risk/reward over the course of their agreement period. we concur with cms that a clear path to risk on a set schedule would benefit the program, provided the transition is modified per above.  ahip and its members support the automatic advancement to the next level of risk/reward, including the option for providers to elect to advance to higher levels faster.\n enhanced track the proposed enhanced track mirrors the existing track 3 with a maximum up-side and down-side of 75 percent. as proposed, acos identified as experienced with performance-based risk medicare aco initiatives, such as acos identified as having previously participated in the program under track 2, track 3 or the track 1+ model, are restricted to participating in either the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest level of risk and reward (if the aco is identified as a low revenue aco) or the enhanced track. acos identified as low revenue could participate in the basic track for up to two agreement periods. acos identified as high revenue would be required to transition to the enhanced track after no more than a single agreement period under the basic track. we note that the jump from level e of the basic track with 30 percent downside risk to the enhanced track of 40 to 75 percent downside risk depending on quality measure performance could be significant. cms should consider a glidepath within the enhanced track to facilitate a smooth transition from the basic track and maintain program stability.\n prospective or retrospective assignment cms proposes to allow basic and enhanced track acos to elect prospective or retrospective assignment prior to the start of each agreement period, and to change that selection for each subsequent performance year. while the balanced budget act of 2018 required cms to make this option available starting january 1, 2020, in this rule, cms proposes to begin the policy july 1, 2019. the option allows acos to elect prospective assignment, which is more akin to their private plan contracts and allows them to be certain of their patient population for the year.  however, it also offers smaller acos an option that permits them to grow their population during the year.  ahip supports cms implementing the choice between prospective or retrospective assignment in 2019 instead of 2020 to coincide with the next application cycle.\n october 16, 2018 page 7\n for agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years, eligible acos would enter into one of the two tracks for an agreement period of not less than 5 years. a 5-year agreement periods demonstrates a commitment to the program and delivery system transformation. moreover, it provides for a longer transition period and ability to measure success. however, the underlying make-up of the aco may change demonstrably over that time. we support the move to 5-year agreement periods but encourage cms to use its authority to re-establish a benchmark if the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s composition significantly changes.\n\n benchmarking methodology refinements\n regional benchmarks cms proposes a revised benchmarking methodology that would incorporate factors based on regional ffs expenditures in establishing the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical benchmark beginning with the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first agreement period, rather than applying this approach starting in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second or subsequent agreement period. cms proposes to mitigate the effects of excessive positive or negative regional adjustments used to establish and reset the benchmark by reducing the maximum weight used in calculating the regional adjustment from 70 percent to 50 percent and capping the regional adjustment amount using a flat dollar amount equal to 5 percent of national medicare ffs per capita expenditures.\n while medicare cannot individually negotiate each contract, it can ensure that it maintains sufficient options within the program to address a few key scenarios to ensure robust participation in the model. the existing transition to regional benchmarks was intended to provide a path for both the low and high-spending providers at the same time. we agree that moving toward regional benchmarks is an important goal and would provide additional symmetry with the ma program. however, cms must proceed in a way that preserves and even encourages participation by the high-spending providers in what is a voluntary program. moving to regional-adjusted benchmarks too quickly will dampen participation by high-spending providers; the very providers we should be targeting.  the faster transition to risk bearing will further exacerbate this perverse incentive. if only the lower spending providers remain, cms will not only lose the opportunity to realize savings from the high-spending providers, but it will subsidize the low-spending providers who are inherently below the regionally-adjusted benchmarks. cms should not pursue a national-regional blended rate trend, but rather should remove acos from the regional reference population to establish a true comparison of the acos relative value.\n october 16, 2018 page 8\n the current risk adjustment policy does not allow for any increases in risk scores for the continuously assigned population except for the increase associated with age. however, cms allows for decreases in risk scores with no exceptions. in this rule, cms proposes to eliminate the distinction between new and continuously assigned beneficiaries and to cap the risk score change over the course of the contract at +/- 3 percent of the risk score for benchmark year 3.\n as it would be simpler, we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to dispense with the differentiation between new and continuously assigned beneficiaries. however, we are concerned that a 3 percent cap on both populations over a 5-year period will dramatically underestimate the changes in the acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 populations. in addition, cms has found that the secular trend in risk score growth among medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries over a 5-year period may be greater than 3 percent on average. for example, on an annual basis cms estimates the growth in beneficiary risk scores over time to calculate a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormalization\u00e2\u0080\u009d factor that is applied to the ma risk adjustment model. this factor adjusts ma enrollee risk scores for risk score growth that has occurred in the ffs population in the years after the risk adjustment model was last calibrated. according to the table below published in the cy2019 advance notice of methodological changes, beneficiary risk scores in the ffs program on average grew either 3.9 percent (left column) or 3.6 percent (right column) over the 5-year period 2013 to 2017.4\n\n\n furthermore, acos will not be able to replicate any of the risk score calculations and will not understand the full effect of the policy until the end of the agreement period. reasonable growth in risk scores should be permitted to accurately and fairly account for a complex and aging\n october 16, 2018 page 9\n population in a medically managed environment. cms should not impose a cap on beneficiary risk score growth and should look to the normalization process within the ma program as precedence for developing a normalization factor to adjust for risk score growth based on estimated growth in the ffs population excluding the aco assigned beneficiaries.\n use of reinsurance cms notes in the rule its concern about continued participation by poor performing acos under performance-based risk based on an ability to obtain reinsurance to offset their liability for shared losses. while cms considered prohibiting acos from obtaining reinsurance to mitigate their performance-based risk, it believes such a requirement could be overly restrictive and that the proposed financial monitoring approach would be effective in removing from the program acos with a history of poor financial performance.\n we agree with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment that prohibiting acos from obtaining reinsurance would be overly restrictive. cms should not only allow mssp participants to use reinsurance, but also return it to the list of qualifying repayment guarantees. reinsurance is an important tool used by provider organizations who participate in capitated and other risk-based contracts. it allows these organizations to titrate the amount of risk they bear to their balance sheets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 capacity to absorb losses. while the mssp model may begin with an up-side only structure, there are other forms of risk associated with beginning an aco such as capital investments, and the risk grows over time based on cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed glidepath. moreover, the providers must consider their full book of business, not just medicare ffs, when determining the best way to protect against losses. while cms may want to limit the extent to which losses can be offset to ensure the providers have sufficient incentive, it should not limit providers ability to insure against the closure of their practice. we do not want to see unintended consequences for beneficiary access as the program progresses. therefore, we believe it is important to allow organizations with nascent risk bearing experience access to tools like reinsurance to help them better manage their financial risks.\n providing tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n october 16, 2018 page 10\n goods or services (including certain gift cards in the nature of a voucher), are considered to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cin-kind items or services\u00e2\u0080\u009d that may be provided to beneficiaries so long as the vouchers meet all other program requirements including a reasonable connection to the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical care.\n to create a level playing field, cms should strive toward parity between the aco and ma plans wherever possible. this proposal does not align with the rewards and incentives requirements for ma plans, which prohibit the offering of rewards and incentives in the form of cash or cash equivalents and only permit offering gift cards or coupons if they are not redeemable for cash. cms should hold acos to the same standard as ma plans by requiring the beneficiary incentive payments be in the form of gift cards or coupons that are not redeemable for cash.\n voluntary assignment cms proposes modifications to the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing policies on voluntary alignment in order to comply with the bipartisan budget act of 2018, by allowing beneficiaries to designate a physician regardless of specialty or a nurse practitioner, physician assistant or clinical nurse specialist as their \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary clinician\u00e2\u0080\u009d responsible for coordinating their overall care. cms will continue to use a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designation to align the beneficiary to the aco in which their primary clinician participates even if the beneficiary does not continue to receive primary care services from an aco professional in that aco.\n ahip supports the voluntary assignment methodology, which gives medicare beneficiaries the opportunity to take an active role in their health care decisions and reinforces the patient- provider relationship. we recommend that cms evaluate acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experiences with the process during the first years of its implementation and continue to refine the methodology based on stakeholder feedback.\n october 16, 2018 page 11\n\n ahip supports the existing voluntary assignment process that began in 2017 and believes cms should focus on fully implementing that process before it considers others. given that beneficiaries do not have a good sense of what acos are, we believe it would be very confusing to beneficiaries to offer such an opt-in process. there is significant difference between a beneficiary acknowledging a relationship with a trusted primary clinician with whom they interact directly and aligning themselves with an aco that largely plays a behind-the-scenes role.\n we feel that an annual enrollment period would cause significant confusion between an mssp opt-in and an ma enrollment. furthermore, it would create substantial administrative burden for itself and for providers by creating and maintaining the vast amount of regulatory guidance and infrastructure needed to operate an opt-in assignment enrollment system like the one used in ma, including detailed marketing and communication guidelines, beneficiary protections, web development, and requirements for potential agents/brokers. if this were to be implemented, there would need to be parity between ma and aco marketing and communication regulations and guidelines.\n lastly, we feel this methodology raises significant concerns about gaming, as acos may be incentivized to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccherry pick\u00e2\u0080\u009d and enroll healthier patients who have had no previous interaction with the aco through a primary clinician. if implemented, cms must establish a robust system to monitor this process for potential fraud and abuse.\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements\n telehealth cms proposes that beginning in january 1, 2020, eligible physicians and practitioners in applicable acos in performance-based risk tracks (basic track level c-e and the enhanced track) could receive payment for telehealth services furnished to prospectively assigned beneficiaries even if the otherwise applicable geographic limitations are not met, including when the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home is the originating site. this policy would apply to acos that elect prospective assignment only. cms also seek comment on an approach that could allow for expansion of this policy to acos under performance-based risk that have selected preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation, instead of prospective assignment, as their assignment methodology.\n october 16, 2018 page 12\n not only ensure a level playing field across risk-bearing organizations, but also increase beneficiary access to timely, high-value care. we urge cms to allow ma plans and medicaid managed care organizations (mcos), who already have significant experience with risk-based contracts, to maximize the benefits of telehealth services by removing unnecessary barriers to their use. in the future, we recommend cms pilot expansion of this policy to acos in one-sided models to determine the appropriateness of allowing expanded telehealth services in this population.\n snf 3-day waiver cms proposes to allow eligible acos in performance-based risk tracks (basic track level c-e and the enhanced track) use of the existing skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver, regardless of their choice of prospective assignment or preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation, to support aco efforts to increase quality and decrease costs. cms also proposes amending the existing snf 3-day rule waiver to allow critical access hospitals and other small, rural hospitals operating under a swing bed agreement to be eligible to partner with eligible acos as snf affiliates for purposes of the snf 3-day rule waiver.\n ahip supports these proposals. however, we are concerned that this proposal may have the unintended consequence of generating inappropriately denied snf claims, which may result in beneficiaries being charged for covered snf. this is more likely to occur with acos that choose preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation. cms should closely monitor the extension of the snf 3-day waiver for potential unintended consequences and update the provision as needed in response.\n updating program policies\n october 16, 2018 page 13\n retire the current ehr quality measure (aco-11: use of certified ehr technology) for performance years starting on january 1, 2019.\n ahip supports allowing for flexibility in the adoption of cehrt among acos participating in mssp. we support aligning the threshold for acos in mssp tracks that qualify as advanced apms with the thresholds used in the qpp. we also support a lower threshold of 50 percent for those acos in tracks that do not qualify as advanced apms. ahip supports retirement of the aco-11 measure dependent on cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 adoption of its proposals related to cehrt use.\n program data and quality measures cms seeks comment on approaches to developing the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality measure set in response to the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative as well as to support acos and their aco providers/suppliers in addressing opioid utilization within the ffs population.  cms seeks comment on existing sources of program data that may be useful for acos to monitor trends in opioid utilization and suggestions for providing additional parts a, b and d data and aggregate statistics to acos.  cms also seeks comment on quality measures that could be used to assess factors related to opioid utilization. cms is considering three measures in particular:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 nqf #2940: use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 nqf #2950: use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 nqf #2951: use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer\n october 16, 2018 page 14\n\n ahip supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to address opioid utilization through the mssp program. we encourage cms to examine opioid utilization measures currently in use in other programs and make every effort to align the mssp set accordingly. we also note that the cqmc is currently in the process of reconvening its workgroups to update its core measure sets. after that process is complete, cms should make every effort to update the cy 2020 mssp set accordingly.\n coordination of pharmacy care for aco beneficiaries cms seeks comment on approaches for encouraging medicare acos to collaborate with the sponsors of stand-alone part d pdps to improve the coordination of pharmacy care for medicare ffs beneficiaries to reduce the risk of adverse events and improve medication adherence. specifically, cms seeks comment on the following: the kinds of support that would be useful for medicare acos and part d sponsors in establishing new, innovative business arrangements to promote pharmacy care coordination; how cms, medicare acos and part d sponsors might structure the financial terms of these arrangements to reward part d sponsors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 contributions towards achieving program goals, including improving the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coordination of care; whether acos are currently partnering with part d sponsors; if there are any barriers to developing these relationships; and recommendations for how cms can assist with reducing barriers and enabling more robust data sharing.\n ahip supports increased collaboration between stand-alone part d sponsors and entities such as acos to improve outcomes for medicare beneficiaries. cms should encourage part d sponsors to enter into such arrangements by removing barriers that limit sponsors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to design and manage formularies and drug utilization. this will allow them to better promote clinician formulary compliance and respond to the needs of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population, such as by increasing medication adherence. for example, removing certain regulatory barriers (e.g., protected class drugs, two drugs per class requirement) or affording plans the ability to create preferred and non- preferred specialty tiers could allow part d sponsors to work with acos to optimize formulary design in addition to generating valuable beneficiary savings. ahip believes that providing more formulary flexibility to plan sponsors is a critical step in ensuring a robust collaboration with other entities such as acos.\n october 16, 2018 page 15\n circumstance, as determined under the qpp, or that the aco's legal entity is located in such an area, the aco's minimum quality score would be set to equal the mean quality performance score for all shared savings program acos for the applicable performance year. if the aco is able to completely and accurately report all quality measures, cms would use the higher of the aco's quality performance score or the mean quality performance score.\n as stated in the shared savings program ifc, cms will reduce an aco's shared losses, if any, determined to be owed under the existing methodology by an amount determined by multiplying the shared losses by two factors: (1) the percentage of the total months in the performance year affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance; and (2) the percentage of the aco's assigned beneficiaries who reside in an area affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance. this proposed approach would also apply to acos that are liable for a pro-rated share of losses as a consequence of voluntary termination of a 12-month performance year after june 30 or involuntary termination by cms.\n ahip supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to extend the policies for addressing the impact of extreme and uncontrollable circumstances on aco financial and quality performance results for performance year 2017 to performance year 2018 and subsequent years. however, we feel more needs to be done to account for the impact of a natural disaster on an impacted aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial performance and ability to report quality measures.\n while the current policy addresses acos that are expected to have shared losses based on performance prior to a natural disaster and have increased shared losses after a natural disaster, it does not address an increase in annual per capital expense as compared to the benchmark/minimum savings rate/minimum loss rate. due to these limitations of the current policy, we instead recommend that cms revise the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy to provide a trend/growth rate that is the higher of the national assignable rate or the regional rate. further, the regional rate should be calculated by excluding the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries.\n the current cms policy awards an average quality score to those affected by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, which can unfairly penalize high performing acos. we recommend cms use an approach similar to the policy currently used in the ma program and award a quality score that is the greater of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality score for the affected performance year, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prior year quality score, or the national mean quality score.\n october 16, 2018 page 16\n creating new modifiers to better identify impact at the beneficiary and claims level by accounting for unsafe place of discharge. cms should also consider adjustments to account for acos that experience extreme and uncontrollable circumstances when calculating total revenue for the purposes of participation track eligibility, determining whether an aco has generated losses that were negative outside corridor and the pre-termination actions that can result, and calculating the repayment mechanism amount.\n thank you for the opportunity to comment on these important issues.  if you have any questions, please contact me at (202) 778-3246 or at dlloyd@ahip.org.\n\n sincerely,\n\n", "0347": "please find the attached comments of the american association of nurse practitioners 3 ensure that the template states that  patients are authorized to choose  nurse practitioners as their designated aco professionals within the mssp. cms also requested feedback on an opt-in option for beneficiaries to choose to participate in an mssp\naco. our concern is that the similarity between the opt-in option and the voluntary alignment option \n may cause confusion among beneficiaries. if cms does move forward with an opt-in option, we would recommend aligning it with the voluntary alignment option so that if a patient \u00e2\u0080\u009copts-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d to an aco the next step would be selecting a primary clinician in the aco. this would then trigger the voluntary alignment beneficiary assignment methodology, allowing patients to select their provider of choice without requiring an unnecessary primary care visit from a primary care or specialty physician for the purposes of assignment. voluntary alignment (83 fr 41894) as we have stated earlier, we support your proposal to update the voluntary alignment methodology and remove 42 cfr \u00e2\u00a7 425.402(e)(2)(i) in its entirety. this would allow  beneficiaries to voluntarily align with an mssp aco by choosing an aco professional, such as an np, to be  responsible for coordinating their overall care. that beneficiary would then be assigned to the aco without having to receive at least one primary care service from a primary care physician who is an aco professional. consistent with the language in the bipartisan budget act of 2018, this would supersede any claims-based assignment methodology. this is an important step to increase the number of clinicians and beneficiaries participating in the mssp and reduce the utilization of unnecessary primary care visits conducted solely for beneficiary assignment. patients should have the authority to select their health care provider of choice, including nps. this proposal is consistent with that principle. we thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed regulation. we look forward to discussing these issues with you. should you have comments or questions, please direct them to maryanne sapio, v.p. federal government affairs, msapio@aanp.org, 703-740-2529.\n\n", "0353": "attached are comments on behalf of unitedhealth group.\n\n unitedhealth group comments medicare program: medicare shared savings program \u00e2\u0080\u0093 accountable care organizations pathway to success\n unitedhealth group (uhg) is responding to a proposed rule that will initiate changes to the medicare shared savings program (mssp) standards for accountable care organizations (acos).  the proposed rule was published by the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) in the federal register on august 17, 2018 (83 fed. reg. 41786).  uhg applauds cms and its work to make its aco programs better by creating quality and value-based care models that tie the achievement of better care delivery to payment.\n cms demonstrates in the proposed rule that the availability of a lower-risk, two-sided model is an effective way to rapidly progress acos to performance-based risk.  the proposed redesign of the mssp has the potential to put the program on a path towards achieving a more measureable transition to health care value, demonstrate savings to the medicare program, and promote a competitive and accountable marketplace.  set out below is an overview of uhg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to value based care which we believe can help inform potential changes to the mssp standards for acos.\n moving to value in care delivery\n uhg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value based care (vbc) model creates a more financially sustainable health care system.  the key emphasis of vbc is on total cost of care, which creates accountability across the entire health care system with every health professional and facility supporting a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care, and points us to the best action to take for the patient and the physician.  this model stresses accountability for all involved through a focus on collaboration rather than volume and outcomes rather than outputs; and we address missed care opportunities rather than overlooking them.  when all of these components come together; we see clear improvement in the health of the people we serve.\n currently, the majority of health care providers are rewarded primarily on volume for more tests and procedures, rather than for coordinating with each other to produce better health outcomes for the entire patient population.  uhg wants to change that approach and promote better care, better health, lower costs, and an improved provider experience.\n we believe these goals can be accomplished using economic incentives, reducing administrative burdens, making it easier to share data, and by supporting peer learning communities where quality improvement efforts are done in collaboration with clinicians.   uhg recommends that any direct provider contracting model, similar to our approach to vbc, should encompass three key priorities:\n\n1. increasing utilization of alternative payment methodologies. \n\n2. reducing administrative and regulatory burdens on providers to support delivery of coordinated \n quality care.\n3. driving more efficient and timely sharing of data among, and for the benefit, of all stakeholders \n \u00e2\u0080\u0093 cms, payers, providers and patients.\n\n uhg is advancing a vbc model that impacts over 15 million consumers by partnering with more than 1,100 hospitals and 110,000 physicians with an emphasis on the total cost of care for a population.  key elements of success for this model include:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 keeping beneficiaries at the center of the health care system empowered with more information and support care delivery. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 emphasizing proactive, preventive care and keeping people healthy through care coordination. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 empowering providers via new technology, data, and financial incentives to coordinate care through information sharing.  data is available to identify patient health risks, improve care coordination, and enhance efficiency costs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 ensuring care providers are paid based on value generated, such as clinical quality, patient health improvements, and reducing per capita health care costs or total cost of care.\n detailed below are uhg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recommendations and best practices for how to implement direct provider contracting by leveraging uhg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best practices in vbc.\n \u00ef\u0083\u00bc reward beneficiaries for choosing high-performing physicians by offering financial incentives to motivate beneficiaries that choose high-performing, vbc providers. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc help beneficiaries find the highest value provider and site of service to ensure they receive high quality care and save money. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc provide innovative and consumer friendly technologies allowing beneficiaries to compare health care prices and quality ratings for doctors and hospitals. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc encourage beneficiaries to stay well through the use of virtual platforms. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc offer providers technology, timely patient data, and financial rewards to help them take better care of patients, to compare their performance to other physicians in the community and their peers, to evaluate costs of care through an episode of care, and to make a smooth transition to\nvbc. \n \u00ef\u0083\u00bc work with providers to reduce the administrative burdens and costs for managing care provided to beneficiaries.  this approach includes efforts to reduce prior authorization process challenges and enhanced sharing of electronic data to minimize time burdens and rework. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc engage providers in the development of measures used in our vbc model and create peer learning communities where provider organizations can learn from each other.  this type of approach is highly rewarding for care providers and effective in improving the quality of care medicare beneficiaries. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc seek to build trusting collaboration with providers resulting in communications, approvals, and patient follow-up are done with providers rather than to providers. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc work with providers and beneficiaries to ensure that every step along the care continuum is coordinated with a primary care provider, provides appropriate care at the highest value site of service, uses evidence based practices, and improves the health of beneficiaries with lower costs.\n addressing the needs of acos in the medicare shared savings program\n as noted, uhg believes there are a number of important \u00e2\u0080\u009clessons learned\u00e2\u0080\u009d from our vbc initiatives that can be applied to acos participating in medicare care delivery.  uhg emphasizes the following critical points with aco partners, which focus on value:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 improving high-risk patient care. a practice must be able to identify its most at-risk patients and help them get care. uhg works with providers and provides them data to accomplish this. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 expanding access to care. from extended hours and same day appointments to redirecting care, acos must help patients get convenient, timely care. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 improved care coordination can be enhanced through multi-disciplinary care teams lead by the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary care physician and that include case managers, pharmacists, behavioral health clinicians, and community health workers where appropriate. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 reducing avoidable readmissions and emergency room use. getting daily discharge data lets doctors better manage care transitions and follow-up care. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 identifying and closing missed care opportunities.  when payers and providers share data, they can see across a patient population, making it easier to identify risk and care gaps. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 improving patient satisfaction.  data from a payer can help providers more proactively engage with their patients to create a better health care experience.\n in the context of the proposed rule, we believe these points can be supplemented by defining the key foundational elements for the success of direct provider contracting models generally.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 direct contracting providers should be required to meet minimum standards for size and capability in order to be effective \u00e2\u0080\u0093 certain direct provider contracting models will not be effective with individual or small group providers.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 convening organizations may not be necessary, but the parameters for a direct provider contracting model should allow for both scenarios \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with and without a convening organization.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the defined qualifications and capabilities should be similar to those required for the aco or comprehensive primary care plus models, but allow flexibility in meeting those qualifications and capabilities to support innovative approaches and reduce administrative and regulatory burdens.  we would note that participants in existing models such as the next generation aco program or mssp should not be precluded from also participating in a direct provider contracting models.\n moving acos to accept additional risk\n the proposed rule introduces significant changes to the mssp in an effort to promote aco structures to accept down-side risk. uhg supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall goal as outlined in the proposed rule transitioning acos to performance-based risk payment models.  based on our experience, health care providers are most comfortable in upside risk-only arrangements and need additional incentives to move to an arrangement where the aco also accepts down-side risk.\n uhg is concerned, however, with the timeframe provided to new and renewing acos in upside only models to transition to new models as well as the introduction of new early termination policies based on spending increases outside a certain risk corridor.  we respectfully ask cms to consider a slower conversion to mandatory risk, allowing greater time for acos to prepare for the transition.\n accounting for the shared-savings payments earned by acos, mssp net savings reached $541.7 million in 2013\u00e2\u0080\u00932015 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not a loss of $344.2 million as estimated by cms.1  while we appreciate and understand the need to control costs to assist in extending the medicare trust fund, we are concerned with the conflicting data regarding the cost savings.\n another primary area of concern is with the financial monitoring and new early termination policies for acos based on spending increases outside a certain risk corridor.  any consideration of terminating an aco due to financial performance should offer an aco at least three years to develop the competencies needed for success.   in addition, cms should consider using a blended evaluation process, based on both spend outside the corridor and high cost utilization. finally, for acos that have achieved significant success in the past yet are struggling in current performance years, cms must offer support and credit in exchange for the significant savings the aco was responsible for and provide consideration for factors such as changes in the assignment methodology and risk adjustment of the population that provide challenges for those acos in any current performance year.\n elimination of aco mssp tracks\n uhg supports with certain modifications the proposed elimination of tracks 1 and 2 and creation of new basic and enhanced tracks as well as the lengthening of the agreement period to at least five years. because newer acos coming into the program need a minimum of three full years to prepare for risk, we propose that level a shared risk be at 50% with allowance to remain in track a for three years to allow for transition to risk.  the risk sharing rate of 25% is relatively low, does not provide sufficient allowance for transition to risk, and does not allow much flexibility.  in addition, the opt-out provision should be kept after the third year.  acos should have opportunity to exit the program if necessary infrastructure is not in place and they are not able to transition to risk quickly with the glide path.\n while we agree that the proposed five year agreement period helps the benchmark become more predictable, the plus/minus three percent does not allow sufficient adjustment and the cap should be set to zero.  cms should consider an approach using a normalization factor; allow full risk adjustment changes to the benchmark.\n in addition, under the proposed rule the first performance year for new aco would be scored on the first six months.  this is not an effective measure for a new aco, as they would not have the sufficient patient data.   this standard would have little effect for calendar year 2019.   a proposed solution would be to create a six month benchmark comparison that adjusts for seasonality.  as an alternative, cms could consider limiting new participants to a january 1, 2020 start date.\n development of basic and advanced tracks\n uhg supports with modifications making the enhanced track an advanced apm under requirements established by the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 (macra) as well as basic track e in that it is consistent with how the current tracks are scored in the merit based incentive payments system (mips).  however, we are aware that acos are at risk for deficits to their benchmarks.\n even no shared risk or only upside risk programs may be problematic due to a delayed repayment schedule given the significant investments by an aco.  as a result, cms should consider additional (c-d) tracks for advanced apm status in the future.  we are aware that the basic tracks are considered as mips apms (a-d levels) and there is a benefit in that cost is included in this model, which is helpful with respect to scoring.\n as noted, while we generally agree with the glide path approach outlined in the proposed rule, additional time may be needed to transition acos to a new risk model.  one to two years in a risk free glide path may not be enough time for certain acos to get ready to take on risk.  acos need time to develop programs that will continue to make them successful.   our concern is that while the glide path does get acos to shared risk and value based payments, what happens when an aco stops making efforts to reduce utilization?   low revenue acos struggle with cost and expenses and many low revenue acos see continued decline in their inpatient, emergency room, and skilled nursing facility utilization, yet still see the costs associated with the same areas of utilization increase), and the proposed glide path may discourage acos from providing cost effective care.\n determining participation based on revenue and prior participation\n the proposed rule establishes new criteria for aco participation based on fee for service revenue and prior program participation.  uhg supports the proposal of determining experienced and inexperienced acos using the methodology focusing on revenue levels and acceptance of risk.\n we also agree with that the definition of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeferred aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d should be clarified and easily determined by the aco to avoid confusion.  however, we believe the definition as set out in the proposed rule is not sufficient clear.  we suggest that a deferred aco should be an aco that extended its first agreement period by one year.  for example, an aco with a first agreement period beginning january 1, 2013 and ending december 31, 2015 would be considered a deferred aco if, at the end of the first term, the aco elected to extend its term for one year, from  january 1, 2016 to december 31, 2016, as allowed under 42 cfr \u00e2\u00a7425.200.  an aco that renewed its first  three year agreement period (i.e., january 1, 2013 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 december 31, 2015) for a second  three year agreement period (i.e., january 1, 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 december 31, 2018), would not be considered a deferred aco.\n track 1 time restrictions\n the proposed rule places time restrictions on acos under track 1 to be in the basic b track for six months and twelve months through 2020.  we agree with these limitations.\n monitoring financial performance\n uhg has concerns with the financial performance requirements in the proposed rule.  first, any consideration of terminating an aco due to financial performance should offer an aco at least three years to develop the competencies needed for success.  in addition, cms should consider a blended evaluation, based on spend outside the risk corridor as well as high cost utilization.  as stated previously, low revenue acos can demonstrate consistent reductions in utilization of high spend services, yet see the costs associated with that utilization increase.  these increased costs may be mitigated by removing the risk adjustment cap; however, a blended approach would still serve the interests of both acos and\ncms.  \n\n acos that demonstrate improvement in the areas of high cost utilization should not be penalized.  cms should be cautious about the potential ramifications of terminating acos that are demonstrating success in key areas of the program, even if that success does not translate to reductions in spend below the minimum savings rate, as removing them from the program will result expenditure increases for the populations managed by the aco.\n finally, for acos that have achieved significant success in the past yet are struggling in current performance years, cms must provide support and credit in exchange for the significant savings they were responsible for and consideration for factors such as changes in the assignment methodology and risk adjustment of the patient population.\n benchmarking methodology refinements\n the proposed rule modifies the mssp risk adjustment methodology to use cms-hcc prospective risk scores to adjust the historical benchmark for changes in severity and case mix for all assigned beneficiaries.  the adjustment is subject to a symmetrical cap of positive or negative three percent for the agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019, and in subsequent years.  uhg does not support the proposed risk adjustment methodology changes.  both the aco and cms could be vulnerable with a three percent cap.  the proposed limit is not sufficient and would not protect the aco if there is a significant change in population demographics.\n use of regional factors in aco benchmarks\n cms is proposing to generally use the same methodology for determining the historical benchmarks for acos in their first agreement period and for subsequent periods.  under this proposal there would be an adjustment in the weights applied during each benchmark year of ten percent, thirty percent, and sixty percent respectively.  we agree with the proposed regional historic methodology weights and time periods, however, we request that cms provide additional clarification on how this proposal will impact the majority of acos participating in the mssp.\n voluntary beneficiary alignment\n cms seeking comments on the voluntary alignment of beneficiaries.  uhg does not support this proposal and strongly objects to voluntary beneficiary alignment as proposed by cms.   acos are challenged by the designation of patients based on the professionals already assigned to the aco.   this proposal, if finalized, would make it extremely difficult to track costs and could result in unintended detrimental effects.\n the proposed rule also seeks feedback on ways to increase beneficiary awareness of aco options and further improve the electronic process through which a beneficiary may voluntarily identify an aco professional as their primary care provider through my.medicare.gov for purposes of aco assignment. the proposed notification could prove detrimental to all acos, does not appear to align with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s integrity provisions, and potentially would allow some acos to selectively choose healthy patients while others are selected against.  we respectfully urge cms to carefully review this proposal and the potential impacts prior to finalizing.\n\n\n promoting interoperability\n uhg supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recommendation to use the certified electronic health record technology (cehrt) process to determine eligibility for initial participation by the aco in the promoting interoperability program.  we agree that asking acos to certify that at least fifty percent of their eligible clinicians use cehrt as part of the annual certification of compliance with mssp requirements.\n we also recommend that cms adopt certain clinical data exchange requirements in the aco setting. uhg promotes full clinical data integration with care providers into our vbc model.  health information technology, particularly capabilities tied to interoperable health data exchange, has an important role to play in our integrated vbc strategy.   health data interoperability provides the foundation to improve outcomes, decrease costs, and improve patient experience.\n our clinical data exchange and integration plan has the following elements which cms should consider for aco participants \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the approach we use (a) is based on hl7 interoperability standards; (b)  works with care providers to exchange admission and discharge notifications, discharge orders/summaries and clinical documentation, including progress notes and laboratory results in an agreed upon electronic format compliant with office of the national coordinator for health information technology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promoting interoperability standards; and (c) specifies the frequency and timeliness of data exchange using real-time data exchange as often as possible.\n in addition, provider electronic health records must allow access on-site and remotely for purposes of successful clinical data integration allowing hipaa defined  treatment and healthcare operations including concurrent inpatient care coordination, national committee for quality assurance (ncqa) audits, and discharge planning and post-discharge care coordination.\n development of meaningful quality measures\n uhg fully supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new initiative to promote meaningful measures in the quality and cost areas. quality measure development organizations have processes to promote meaningful outcomes associated with non-burdensome measures based on stakeholder input.   measures should be constantly monitored and updated yearly based on best evidence.  in this context, we recommend that cms align the star ratings program measures and ncqa healthcare effectiveness data and information set (hedis) measures with the macra standards as well as other measures used in interoperability incentive programs that it oversees and leads.  for example, measure 8 in the aco measures chart should be aligned with star ratings and ncqa measures and not be outside the scope or reporting requirements of either entity.\n the alignment of measures will dramatically reduce the operational burdens placed on providers who participate in multiple accreditation and incentive programs, and will help payers assisting providers to meet their requirements.  if these measures are placed within an incentives program like the cms star ratings initiative, we believe health plans and other stakeholders would be meaningfully aligned in improving and promoting interoperability.\n of this request, and we would be pleased to participate in further discussion with cms regarding this issue.\n addressing the opioid epidemic\n uhg works very closely with its aco providers to combat opioid misuse.  we send a monthly report regarding opiate utilization that displays information on a per member per month basis by prescriber. this report also highlights high prescribers with high utilizing members.  we also share more in-depth reports indicating prevalence of opioid use disorder (oud) and overdose diagnosis and medication assisted treatment (mat) to give our providers a more robust picture of their patients facilitating treatment and care coordination based on better data and information.  in addition, we make available educational materials for aco health care providers, including topics such as opioid tapering, non-opioid pain treatment alternatives, naloxone prescribing guidance and coverage, and how to locate in-network mat providers.\n we support the inclusion of opioid quality measures listed by cms to address the opioid epidemic to improve patient safety.  however, we recommend that cms break out these two measures into three categories that would highlight: (a) four or more prescribers; (b) four or more pharmacies; and (c) four or more prescribers and four or more pharmacies for target intervention.\n nqf #2950 (use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer) should be reported as follows:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 measure 1: analyzes the proportion (xx out of 1,000) of medicare part d beneficiaries 18 years or older without cancer or enrolled in hospice receiving prescriptions for opioids from four (4) or more prescribers \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 measure 2: analyzes the proportion (xx out of 1,000) of medicare part d beneficiaries 18 years or older without cancer or enrolled in hospice receiving prescriptions for opioids

receiving prescriptions for opioids from four (4) or more prescribers and four (4) or more pharmacies.\n nqf #2951 (use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer) should be reported as follows:\n\n in addition, uhc includes the measures developed by the cdc in its opioid guidelines, and recommend that cms include these measures as well:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 percentage of initial opioid prescription that is immediate-release instead of extended- release/long-acting (er/la) \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 percentage of initial opioid prescription with daily dosage < 50 morphine milligram equivalent  (mme) \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 percentage of  initial opioid prescription with less than 7 days of supply\n promoting telehealth care delivery mechanisms\n uhg supports telehealth as an enabling technology and care delivery innovation among customers, patients and care providers to achieve the triple aim of better health, better care and better cost controls. telehealth can help accomplish these goals by:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 better health - improving outcomes via enhanced care delivery options and high-value care delivery. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 better care - enhancing the patient experience and access to care while maintaining care continuity with primary care and other health care providers. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 better cost control - reducing per capita costs by engaging consumers at lower-level points of access and/or lower intensity services.\n cms proposes that the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home would be a permissible originating site type for telehealth services furnished by a physician or practitioner participating in an applicable aco.  to support this approach, we ask cms to clarify how they will determine that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe telehealth services must not be inappropriate to furnish in the home setting\u00e2\u0080\u009d (42 cfr \u00e2\u00a7425.613(a)(1)(iv)) and define the \u00e2\u0080\u009cinappropriate use of telehealth services.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (42 cfr \u00e2\u00a7425,613(d)(2)).  in addition, we ask whether there be different coding requirements when the patient is at home to allow payers the ability to differentiate between the cms defined originating site and the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home which is not currently provided.  issuing guidance on these issues will better assist providers and payers in establishing appropriate telehealth services.\n use of stop-loss coverage\n under the proposed new model - pathways to success does not allow an option for acos to opt out of the individual stop loss provision, unlike the flexibility provided under the next generation aco model. uhg recommends that cms allow acos the ability to opt out of the specific stop loss protection if desired, and purchase this coverage on the open marketplace.   this approach allows acos to structure coverage to specifically meet their organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk tolerance as opposed to a nationwide ninety-nine percentile truncated approach.  in addition, competitive pricing will often result in lower costs for this protection\n\n\n", "0357": "please accept amga's comments on the proposed medicare shared savings rule (cms-1701-p).     \u0013 page   \\* mergeformat \u001417\u0015\n\u0013 page   \\* mergeformat

amga, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedicare program: medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success,\u00e2\u0080\u009d proposed rule (cms-1701-p).\nfounded in 1950, amga represents more than 450 multi-specialty medical groups and integrated delivery systems representing approximately 177,000 physicians who care for one-in-three americans.  our member medical groups work diligently to provide innovative, high quality patient-centered medical care in a spending efficient manner.  many of our medical groups currently participate in the medicare shared savings program (mssp), or the accountable care organization (aco), in the track 1+ and next generation aco demonstrations, the comprehensive primary care + model, as well as other related medicare demonstrations.  amga, therefore, continues to have a very strong interest in improving population health, care quality and reducing medicare spending growth.\nwe begin with a list of our key recommendations.\namga objects to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 persistence in measuring program performance against aco benchmarks since they are not valid counterfactuals.  for this reason, amga disagrees that spending relative to benchmarks serves as a justification for a more rapid transition into risk-bearing acos.\nto allow providers a reasonable chance to succeed under the mssp, cms needs to improve program benchmarking to correct for current weak financial incentives.  moreover, cms should discontinue use of historical spending in resetting subsequent agreement period benchmarks. this corrects for providers having to endlessly improve upon past performance.  instead, cms should simply update benchmarks annually after the first performance period.  the current use of a regional blend factor, however calculated, does nothing to address the underlying flaw of continuing use of historical spending.\nproviders participating in the proposed aco basic track should have the option to remain in an upside-only track for three years, rather than the two years that cms has proposed (essentially discounting py 2019).  that is, they should be given the option of a second year under basic b.  as proposed, new acos would receive 2.5 years of upside only; continuing track 1 acos can sign a new five-year agreement on july 1, 2019 and get an additional two years of upside only, or they can sign a new agreement beginning january 2020 or january 2021 and receive an additional two years of upside only.\ncms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal of a 25 percent shared savings rate for basic levels a and b further weakens what are already nominal financial incentives.  the shared savings rate should be no less than 50 percent for upside-only acos.  upside only \u00e2\u0080\u009clow revenue acos should receive higher earned shared savings, for example, 75 percent or 80 percent.\ncms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to define high- versus low- revenue acos as those with revenue more than or less than 25 percent of their assigned beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 annual part a and b expenditures is too restrictive.  cms should start at 30 percent and consider other metrics in distinguishing the two and/or define risk tolerance more granularly.\ncms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to terminate an aco from the program if it falls outside the negative minimum savings rate (msr) or minimum loss rate (mlr) corridor is an unnecessary provision, as acos in the proposed glide path will assume financial risk.  in addition, it cannot be determined that acos that fall outside of their negative corridor, are, in fact, losing the medicare program money as benchmarks are not valid counterfactuals.\namga supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to (more) accurately risk score the continuously enrolled by allowing scores to increase by a maximum of three percent over the five-year agreement period.  we also recommend cms work to improve medicare risk scoring beyond use of hierarchical condition category (hcc) coding via, for example, select use of consumer assessment of health plans (cahps) data.\nas amga has argued previously, payment waivers for the skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule and telehealth and remote patient monitoring (rpm) should be available to all acos.  we disagree with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rationale for restricting these payment waivers to two-sided models. whether at-risk or not, the waivers provide acos with the ability to ensure patients are receiving the most appropriate care in the most appropriate setting.\nper the balanced budget act (bba) of 2018, amga supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to establish a voluntary beneficiary incentive program and a voluntary alignment program. amga believes other incentives should be added to incentivize beneficiaries to receive their care within an aco \u00e2\u0080\u009cnetwork.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\namga supports a voluntary beneficiary opt-in based assignment methodology.\namga supports the use of additional codes in defining primary care services for the purposes of beneficiary assignment.\namga encourages the agency to issue a notice of proposed rule making (nprm) or a request for information (rfi) that outlines proposed ways in which aco providers can, within legal and regulatory restraints, actively coordinate beneficiary care with part d providers.\namga also encourages cms to better align quality measure reporting requirements across the medicare program.\namga supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to align certified electronic health record technology (cehrt) across the mssp and the quality payment program (qpp).  currently set at 50 percent, this threshold would increase to 75% if cms finalizes the increase in its pending medicare physician fee schedule rule and opts to align the programs in this mssp proposal.\namga recommends cms provide additional clarity before moving forward with its proposal to address quality performance, scoring, and any financial reconciliation for acos that were affected by \u00e2\u0080\u009cextreme and uncontrollable circumstances.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\noverview comment\nover the past several years, amga has stated that the medicare program, as well as commercial payers, should continue to move toward value-based payment arrangements.  the current fee for service (ffs) payment model promotes volume of services provided and does not incent prevention or better patient health.  amga members are leaders in moving to value and are heavily invested in the mssp, in other merit-based incentive payment system's alternative payment models (mips apms), and advanced apms, including the next generation aco demonstration.\nconcerning the mssp, amga remains concerned that the program, since its inception in 2012, has suffered from weak financial incentives.  substantial evidence of this has been published in numerous health affairs, journal of the american medical association (jama), jama internal medicine, and the new england journal of medicine articles and in other reputable publications by academic researchers.  because of weak incentives, the mssp has produced limited financial savings to date.  however, it is important to note that what savings the program has produced, including savings achieved by track 1 acos, are widely under-appreciated.  the belief persists that program performance can be measured against aco benchmarks, or that they serve as valid counterfactuals.  they do not.  program performance has been compromised by, among other reasons, flaws in the program's financial benchmarking formulas, both in benchmark updating and in resetting or rebasing.  in addition, observers typically fail to fully account for or recognize favorable spillover effects, including those in the medicare advantage program.\nwe would also be remiss if we did not note that program quality improvement performance has markedly improved.  in performance years 2016 and 2017, the mean composite quality performance scores were 93 percent and 91 percent respectively.\nbecause of weak financial incentives, we were not surprised to read, for example, in the harvard department of health care policy comment letter dated september 18, \u00e2\u0080\u009cacos have had little incentive to ever lower spending because of the link between the spending reductions they achieve and subsequent benchmarks.  one could argue that it is astonishing that the mssp has produced any savings at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the current proposed rule suggests cms believes it is time to create an mssp 2.0.  this is made evident in the proposed rule's executive summary where the agency argues the program needs to be \u00e2\u0080\u009credesigned\u00e2\u0080\u009d or reinvented.  again, because of weak financial incentives, we do not believe the program needs redesign.  the problem to date has been the lack of legitimate opportunity to succeed under mssp 1.0.\namga recognizes the proposed rule offers several potential, if not real, improvements to the program.  for example, the proposed rule would improve how the agency risk adjusts for the continuously assigned beneficiary.  these improvements aside, the program has always been largely defined by how the agency calculates aco benchmarks.  cms proposes to reform how the agency calculates established and reset or rebased benchmarks by revising its use of a regional blend.  as we argue below, this proposed change, while well intended, cannot correct an inherently flawed benchmark formula.  incorporating a regional blend is problematic per se.  simply stated, we recommend the agency simply update annually an aco's benchmark after performance year one and not reset or rebase the aco's benchmark using historical spending.  this would obviate the need for a regional blend.  again, because the program suffers from weak incentives, commensurate with this change, we also recommend cms substantially increase the percent of earned shared savings for those acos with comparatively low spending in their region. we also recommend the agency exclude an aco's spending in calculating annual benchmark updates.\nwe believe that if the agency improves mssp financial benchmarking by correcting for the perverse effects of the regional blend, and as we argue below, make improvements to risk adjustment, risk tolerance, quality performance benchmarking and beneficiary engagement, the agency can expect the provider community to continue to be enthusiastic mssp participants.\nproposed basic and enhanced tracks\nbriefly summarized, cms proposes to create two new aco tracks: basic and enhanced.  the basic track would consist of five levels: a through e.  basic a and b would present no financial risk.  level c through e would pose increasing financial risk.  by level e, acos would face financial risk comparable to the current track 1+.  the proposed enhanced track would be comparable to the current track 3.  track 1, 1+ and track 2 models would sunset.  under the proposed rule beginning july 1, 2019, newly formed acos that are also \u00e2\u0080\u009clow revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d could participate under basic a for ostensibly two performance years, or half of 2019, or july 1 through december 31, and all of calendar year 2020 and 2021.  existing or renewing track 1 acos would have to begin with basic b beginning july 1, 2019.  participating 2018 acos that sunset on december 31 of this year can continue in the program through june 30, 2019 without having their financial benchmark reset.\nessentially, cms is reducing providers' current ability to participate in the mssp at no risk from six years via two contracts of three years each.  under the proposed glide path, providers will have a maximum of two years before moving into a risk-bearing model.  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to accelerate the transition from no risk to at risk is what the agency terms, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpressing concern,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for several reasons.  the agency argues, in part, at risk or two-sided aco models outperform no risk acos.  although amga rejects how cms calculates savings in the mssp, we understand cms has concluded in 2016 that 68 percent of two-sided acos shared savings compared to 29 percent of track 1 acos.  cms also notes 41 percent of \u00e2\u0080\u009clow revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shared savings compared to 23 percent of \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos.  cms is also concerned the presence of no risk or upside only acos may be encouraging marketplace consolidation.\nwe do not believe there is adequate information to conclude at risk acos out-compete no risk acos.  among other reasons, again, it has been convincingly demonstrated that aco financial benchmarks are not legitimate counterfactuals.  in addition, cms admits that in 2016, 15 of 22 at risk track 2 and 3 acos shared savings.  this sample size is too small to draw a definitive conclusion.\nwhile we support the move to risk-bearing agreements, our members have expressed concern that limiting upside agreements to two years does not take into account operational challenges in transitioning into an essentially new mssp program.  we believe cms should offer a third, upside only year.   among other reasons, we offer seven.  first, performance cannot or should not be measured relative to benchmarks.  for example, up until 2017, benchmarks were updated annually using a national growth factor only, despite the fact spending growth varies geographically.  the national growth factor includes all beneficiaries, including those who had no calendar year spending.  this compromises the accuracy of national updates; and, aco spending reductions also are included in the national growth factor, further artificially lowering the update.  in sum, benchmarks, specifically those of upside only acos, should not be used to rationalize accelerating risk agreements.\nsecond, assuming cms finalizes many of the proposed changes in this rule, providers should be given adequate time to adjust to these regulatory changes.  essentially, cms has created a new mssp program and acos will need at least a year to understand how these new regulatory changes affect their operations.  additionally, while cms has been diligent in working to ensure the timely sharing of aco data, the fact remains that there is a year plus data lag to acos.  thus, acos will not truly understand how or whether their care management processes are working for more than a year after they enter the program.\nthird, the program is reducing medicare spending.  in its september 18 letter, harvard scholars estimate $431 million in savings, particularly in post-acute care, over 2014 and 2015. therefore, there is certainly no urgent need to impose downside risk.  fourth, cms does not want to risk momentum in program participation, particularly among acos that are positive within their msr corridor.  fifth, cms should recognize upside only does not mean acos are at no risk of losing their investments in administrative and reporting costs.  acos have invested in the necessary health information technology, care management processes, staffing, and related infrastructure to assume responsibility for a patient population. logically, if track 1 were not at risk, fewer providers would remain in the program.  instead, nearly half of the 2012-2013 track 1 class and a third of the 2014 class have dropped out of the program.  sixth, the intended positive effect risk bearing imposes, that it will enhance savings, will be mitigated by, among other options, acos partnering with third-party management firms to limit their risk exposure. finally, cms should critically evaluate whether there is, in fact, a correlation between upside only agreements and industry consolidation, as the agency suggests there is.  we see no evidence that supports this belief.\nspecifically, amga supports the agency's proposals to:\nextend the current agreement period from three to five years\nallow acos to select their basic level prior to the start of a performance year\nallow acos in any basic and the enhanced track the flexibility to change their selection of beneficiary assignment methodology, either prospective or prospective with retrospective reconciliation, prior to the start of the performance year\nallow acos to forgo the formal 2019 application cycle\nallow acos with a participation agreement ending date of december 31, 2018, or the 2012 and 2013 acos and the 2016 acos, to extend their current agreement to june 30, 2019\nallow existing acos to terminate their agreement effective june 30, 2019 and restart under a new five year agreement on july 1, 2019\nallow existing track 1s, defined as \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that enter the basic track on july 1, 2019 to remain in basic b until january 2021\nallow existing track 1s that choose to complete their current agreement the choice to re-enter the program under basic b, c, d or e\nallow acos in all other current tracks to continue under their existing agreement until they expire\nintegrate track 1+ into the mssp\nallow track 2 acos the option to elect to enter the proposed enhanced track or elect to enter the proposed basic track at the highest level of risk or level e\nallow low revenue acos the ability to transition from basic to enhanced after a single agreement period under basic while retaining the opportunity to return to the basic\ngradually increase risk thresholds at basic level c and level d at two and four percent of revenue, respectively, and set basic level e at the current track 1+ risk level.\namga recognizes providers need a glide path to succeed under the mssp.   we believe if cms makes the appropriate improvements to the mssp discussed below, providers will have an improved glide path to succeed under incremental financial risk as proposed in this rule.\nuse of regional factors when establishing and resetting acos benchmarks\nbecause cms currently resets financial benchmarks using historical spending based on the aco's immediately previous three performance years, or their just concluded agreement period, it becomes increasingly difficult for acos to improve upon their past performance.  for this reason, cms in 2016 introduced a regional adjustment to the reset or rebased historical benchmark beginning with the aco's second agreement period.\ncms is now proposing to include a regional adjustment to initial aco agreements beginning july 1, 2019 and to all subsequent agreements. cms also proposes to revise the regional blend weights.  specifically, cms proposes to continue to apply a first time 35 percent regional weight if the aco's historical spending was lower than its region and a 25 percent regional weight if the aco's historical spending was higher than its region.  however, in subsequent agreement periods, cms is proposing to reduce the regional blend weights.  for second agreement periods, cms is proposing to apply a regional weight of 50 percent if the aco's historical spending was lower than its region and 35 percent if the aco's historical spending was higher than its region.  in third and subsequent agreement periods, the regional blend would be 50 percent for all acos.\ncms argues it is lowering the regional blend weights because in instances where the aco's spending is lower than its region, \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-spending acos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the agency states, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay become overly inflated to the point where these organizations need to do little to maintain or change their practices to generate savings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the regional blend also presents a problem regarding acos with spending comparatively higher than their region.  for acos with comparatively higher spending, a regional blend is a disincentive for them from participating in the program or continuing to participate in the program, particularly when the agency is proposing to require aco participants to take on financial risk earlier.  as dr. j. michael mcwilliams and his harvard colleagues reported in their september 18 letter in response to the proposed mssp rule, \u00e2\u0080\u009cintroduction of the regional adjustment in 2017 was associated with a 21 percent drop out in the 2014 aco cohort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and these were the acos that \u00e2\u0080\u009chad higher spending for their region than those who remained in the program.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  mcwilliams terms this problem, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccost-increasing selective participation\u00e2\u0080\u009d because the selective drop out of acos with comparatively higher spending creates perverse incentives.\nthe agency's proposal to mitigate the perverse effects of the regional blend is inadequate.  it does nothing to solve the inherent problem: the agency's policy to reset or rebase an acos benchmark using their historical spending.  if the agency addressed or remedied this problem there would be no need for adding a regional blend.  not surprisingly, mcwilliams and his colleagues conclude, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe recommend replacing the regional adjustment with higher shared savings rates for acos with lower spending for their service area.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  they recommend shared savings rates rise continuously from a minimum of 50 percent for acos with comparatively high regional spending to shared savings rates at 80 percent for acos with comparatively low regional spending.  they recommend also the agency use two years of data to assess an aco's spending relative to their region.  while we are not certain these shared savings percentages are perfect, they improve upon current weak financial incentives, and help level the playing field between high and low spending acos. they would not, as mcwilliams and his colleagues argue, mean higher shared savings would decrease net savings to the medicare program.  they argue, for example, higher shared savings rates would attract more provider participation and provide additional motivation to lower spending.  eliminating a regional blend would also obviate the need, as cms proposes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto cap the regional adjustment amount using a flat dollar amount equal to the 5 percent of national per capita expenditures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwe noted the impetus for adding a regional blend was to mitigate the problem of resetting benchmarks using, or still using, an aco's historical spending.  we further recommend the agency abandon the practice of benchmark resets in all subsequent aco agreement periods.  here again, logic forces us to agree with dr. mcwilliams and his colleagues.  in their september 18 letter, they recommend, \u00e2\u0080\u009celiminate rebasing of benchmarks that links an aco's new benchmark to its spending changes in the prior period.  this link should be completely severed.  instead, the aco's original baseline should be updated annually according to a growth rate that is unrelated to its prior performance, adjusting for changes in the acos' participating providers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  resetting or rebasing an aco's benchmark, which would occur every five years under the proposed rule, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreatly diminishes acos' incentives to ever save because,\u00e2\u0080\u009d mcwilliams, et al. write, \u00e2\u0080\u009cspending reductions now are penalized with lower benchmarks later.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  because of the link between spending reductions and subsequent benchmarks, they go so far as to state, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is astonishing that the mssp has produced any savings at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  they note, not surprisingly, that just prior to 2016 when the 2012-2013 class would be required to have their benchmarks reset, 23 percent dropped out of the program, or nearly four times the percent the left the program in both 2013 and 2014.  while we do not support the continued use of a regional blend in resetting or rebasing and now, as cms proposes, in establishing benchmarks as well, we want to make clear amga continues to support the use of regional spending in calculating annual benchmark updates.\nwe also are obligated to note as we have in past comment letters our concern that cms continues to include an aco's spending on its assigned beneficiaries in calculating annual benchmark updates.  this  formula is increasingly problematic as acos account for an ever-increasing percentage of the ffs population in their region.  this is the same problem or error in aco benchmark resetting.  this approach makes it difficult to determine if acos are reducing spending compared to a counterfactual.\nin sum, via these benchmark-related changes, cms has the opportunity to simplify the program, increase financial incentives, level the playing field, improve participation and retention, and drive greater savings.\nlevels of risk and reward in the basic track's glide path\nfor basic levels a and b, cms is proposing a final earned shared savings rate of 25 percent based on quality performance to first dollar shared savings for acos that meet or exceeded their msr.  earned shared savings would be not exceed 10 percent of the aco's updated benchmark, consistent with current track 1 policy.  basic level c would be able to earn upwards of 30 percent in earned shared savings.  since level c is at risk, shared losses would not exceed two percent of total a and b revenue.  if this amount exceeds one percent of the aco's updated benchmark the loss sharing limit is capped at one percent of the updated benchmark.  level d risk allows for upwards of 40 percent in earned shared savings with shared losses not to exceed four percent of total a and b revenue, or two percent of the updated benchmark.  level e would allow for upwards of 50 percent in earned shared savings with shared losses commensurate with the revenue-based loss-sharing limit for an advanced apm.\nas noted above, current mssp financial incentives are weak.  beyond benchmark updating and resetting problems, current financial incentives are further diluted by the fact that acos bear the upfront and ongoing costs of program participation.  in addition, aco quality performance benchmarking, distinctly unlike the medicare advantage star quality program, remains downside only.  an aco's quality performance benchmark multiplier cannot be better than 1.0.  in effect, cms' proposal to further weaken already inadequate financial incentives will only make matters worse.  therefore, amga cannot support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to reduce shared savings to below 50 percent.  instead, to maintain an incentive for program participation, the shared savings rate should be 50 percent for upside-only acos.  more specifically, stronger financial incentives should be offered to \u00e2\u0080\u009clow revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos and those acos taking increasing levels of risk.  they should be able to earn shared savings up to 75 percent or 80 percent.\n\ndifferentiating between low revenue acos and high revenue acos\ncms proposes low and high revenue acos for the purposes of further defining participation options.\ncms proposes to define a low revenue aco as one whose revenue is below 25 percent of its assigned beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 total part a and b expenditures for the most recent calendar year.  cms defines high revenue as an aco with revenue that is at least 25 percent of its beneficiaries' part a and b expenditures.  low revenue acos tend to be, cms' analysis found, physician-only and/or rural based acos.  high revenue acos would tend to be or include a hospital.  with more control over their total spending and/or being better capitalized, high revenue acos, cms argues, should be more ready and capable of accepting higher financial risk.  low revenue acos less so.   as noted above, for purposes of aco participation, cms is proposing to allow low revenue acos to participate in basic for as long as two, five-year agreement periods.\ncms seeks comments on their proposed definition of low and high revenue, any alternatives including defining by hospital-based and physician-led based on their tax identification number (tin) composition, and differentiating low and high by the size of their assigned populations.\nin theory, amga supports the distinction between low and high revenue acos.  there is intuitive logic that risk tolerance be commensurate with organization size or financial wherewithal.  in practice, low volume acos would be afforded the opportunity to participate at lower risk thresholds for a comparatively longer period.  cms notes its analysis found that 88 percent of self-reported small, physician only and rural acos met the 25 percent threshold.  this point aside, since self-reporting is imperfect, should the agency finalize this distinction, we recommend the agency begin with a 30 percent threshold or margin to account for physician groups with a comparatively larger number of specialists.  over time, the agency can adjust the percent threshold as their ability to discriminate improve.  we also recommend cms consider more than two revenue definitions or categories.  the proposed distinction may be too stark.  concerning alternative definitions using self-reported composition, tins, and size of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population, we similarly encourage the agency to consider using more than one metric or data point in differentiating acos.  that is, low and high revenue could and should be defined by multiple criteria.\nminimum savings rate and minimum loss rate\nin cms' final june 2015 mssp rule, the agency offered at-risk acos the option to select a msr/mlr that will apply for the duration of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3-year agreement period.  under current policy, acos applying to participate in a two-sided model may select from three options: 0% msr/mlr, symmetrical msr/mlr in 0.5% increments between 0.5% and 2.0%, and an upside/downside symmetrical msr that varies based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number of assigned beneficiaries.\ncms is proposing to maintain the same msr/mlr options\u00e2\u0080\u0094both for one-sided and two-sided models\u00e2\u0080\u0094as applicable to the model under which the aco is participating in the basic glide path. therefore, one-sided models would have a variable msr based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number of assigned beneficiaries.  those in two-sided models--basic c, d or e--would select from the options outlined above before the start of their first performance year under risk.  this would also apply if an aco elects to transition more quickly in the glide path or from level a to level c or beyond.\namga supports this proposal.\nrisk adjustment methodology for adjusting historical benchmark each performance year\naco stakeholders have criticized the agency's policy using a risk scoring methodology that differs between newly assigned and continuously assigned aco beneficiaries.  cms uses hierarchical condition category (hcc) prospective risk scores to account for changes in severity and case mix for newly assigned aco beneficiaries between the third benchmark year and the performance year for newly assigned beneficiaries and in subsequent agreement period performance years.  cms uses demographic factors only to adjust risk scores for the continuously assigned aco beneficiaries, or those that are assigned to the aco year- over-year through the performance agreement.  as the proposed rule reminds stakeholders, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif the cms-hcc prospective risk scores for the continuously assigned population are lower in the performance year, we use the lower cms-hcc prospective risk scores to adjust for changes in severity and case mix in this population.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nin the proposed rule, cms states the agency's \u00e2\u0080\u009cpreferred approach would eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  however, the agency has been reluctant to do so because of concerns regarding coding intensity.  nevertheless, cms admits in its examination of the continuously enrolled in 2016, 86 percent of those continuously enrolled in an aco would have received a larger positive adjustment to their benchmark had they been coded the same as the newly enrolled.   the agency's concern is that perpetuating this policy for the continuously enrolled could incent acos to avoid complex patients.  therefore, cms is proposing a symmetrical cap of a positive or negative three percent for the agreement period such that between benchmark year 3 (by3) and any performance year there would never be more than a three percent adjustment in either direction.  the proposed change would take effect july 1, 2019.\namga has argued for years that cms more appropriately or accurately risk score the continuously enrolled.  therefore, we strongly support this proposed change.  while cms notes their study of risk score trends shows that for aco aged/non-dual beneficiaries, the enrollment category that represents the majority of assigned aco beneficiaries, less than 30 percent of acos would see limited positive risk adjustment.  we appreciate cms providing this data point, however, we encourage cms to make fully transparent their research related to this finding, or its findings on the three other aco assigned beneficiary categories.\nin addition, we believe cms can always do more to improve medicare risk scoring, or move beyond hcc coding.  for example, in a march 2016 health affairs article, sherri rose and her colleagues reported that their \u00e2\u0080\u009cfindings suggest that a regional benchmark adjusted only for standard claims-based variables could unfairly penalize acos serving sicker patients.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  as a remedy, these researchers argue, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe aco cahps survey could provide valuable additional information for risk adjustment purposes\u00e2\u0080\u009d such as measures of functional status.  use of cahps data, the researchers argue, could also be used to detect upcoding and thus allow cms to evolve beyond the agency's proposed three percent cap for the continuously enrolled.\nmonitoring for financial performance\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cnow that we have additional experience with monitoring aco financial performance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms states, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe believe that the current regulations are insufficient to address recurrent poor financial performance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  cms states further, \u00e2\u0080\u009csome acos may not have sufficient incentive to remain accountable for the expenditures of their assigned beneficiaries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d therefore, cms is proposing to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonitor for whether the expenditures for the aco's assigned beneficiary population are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  if an aco falls outside or beyond its negative msr or mlr corridor, cms is proposing pre-termination actions.  if the aco falls beyond its negative msr or mlr corridor for another year, cms proposes to terminate the aco's participation.  cms notes only 19 of 194 of first year track 1 acos that renewed (in 2016) fell outside of their negative corridor in their first agreement period.  the agency observed similar performance results for acos that started their first agreement period in 2014 and 2015.\namga certainly supports agency efforts to protect medicare beneficiaries and medicare trust funds.  that said, since again benchmarks are not valid counterfactuals, it is impossible to determine whether acos that fall below or outside their negative mlr corridor are losing the medicare program money.  even assuming acos falling outside their negative mlr corridor are, in fact, losing money, should the proposed rule go final, participating aco providers will have significantly less time participating in upside only or no risk agreements or significantly less time to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cunaccountable for the expenditures of their assigned beneficiaries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  that is how the proposed basic glide path remedies or solves for this problem.  we will add, somewhat ironically, acos outside their negative mlr corridor are saving money in the sense that they are not earning shared savings.\nunder this discussion, cms also notes the agency \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsidered prohibiting acos from obtaining reinsurance to mitigate performance-based risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the agency therefore seeks comment on \u00e2\u0080\u009cacos' use of reinsurance, including their ability to obtain viable reinsurance products covering a medicare ffs population.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  considering the program's history of weak financial incentives, flawed financial benchmarking, limits on risk adjustment, and downside only quality performance benchmarking, we find it difficult to believe prohibiting at risk aco providers from purchasing reinsurance would ultimately benefit participating acos and the medicare program.\nsnf 3-day rule and telehealth waiver rules\nas we argued in our february 2015 comments in response to cms' december 2014 proposed mssp rule, the snf payment waiver should be made available to all acos.  first, because the snf 3-day waiver dates back to the inception of the medicare program more than 50 years ago, we agree with former medicare payment advisor commission chairman glenn hackbarth's assessment that the rule has become \u00e2\u0080\u009carchaic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the snf rule was created when mean hospital lengths of stay were substantially more than twice what they are today.  meeting the 3-day rule in the 1960s was easily accomplished.  today that is no longer the case.  second, the proposed rule recognizes aco program participants need a glide path to risk.  as we wrote in our 2015 comments, providers need the ability to reform their practice patterns before they are required to take on financial risk.  the snf and telehealth waivers enable providers an ability to do this.  intentionally denying them these tools, in effect, compromises the success of the program.  third, the benefit of prolonging a beneficiary's hospital stay such that he or she qualify for a snf admission is far outweighed by the potential iatrogenic harm extended hospital stays present.  finally, five years of performance data demonstrate program savings have been substantially driven by reductions in snf utilization, which lends evidence that the aco provider community is uninterested in abusing snf care.\ncms continues to argue in this proposed rule, risk-bearing models have more impetus \u00e2\u0080\u009cto engage in systematic change, promote accountability for a patient population and coordination of a patient medical care, and encourage investment in redesigned care processes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  even assuming this statement were true, it is neither a reason to deny no risk providers these waivers, nor an either-or instance.\namga does, however, support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow preliminary prospectively assigned beneficiaries to remain eligible for the 3-day snf rule waiver for the remainder of the performance year regardless of if their assignment status changes during the performance year.  effectively, beneficiaries would remain eligible to receive snf services under the waiver unless they meet one of two exceptions: they enroll in a medicare health plan or are no longer enrolled in part a or part b.  amga has no objection to this proposal.\nbeneficiary incentives\nthe bipartisan budget act (bba) of 2018 included a provision that allows acos to apply to operate a beneficiary incentive program.  specifically, the provision allows an aco to make an incentive payment of up to $20, in the form of a cash equivalent, for each qualifying service furnished to an aco assigned beneficiary.  the incentive payment, which cms proposed to begin july 1, 2019, would be made by the aco, not the medicare program, and the aco is responsible for all costs in establishing and operating the program.  a participating aco can, however, use earned shared savings to fund these payments.  payments made are disregarded in calculating an aco's benchmark.  cms is proposing to allow acos participating in two-sided risk models only to participate regardless of the aco's beneficiary assignment choice.\namga supports this voluntary program but strongly believes it should be available to all acos. as we note in this comment, cms needs to create a set of incentives for all acos to provide opportunity for success in the mssp program.  to further incent beneficiary participation and reduce leakage (discussed directly below) amga also supports cms waiving aco assigned beneficiary co-pays and deductibles if they remain within the aco \u00e2\u0080\u009cnetwork\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nrevisions to policies on voluntary alignment\nthe bba of 2018 also allows medicare ffs beneficiaries to voluntarily identify an aco provider as their primary care provider for the purposes of the beneficiary's assignment to the aco.  these beneficiaries would be assigned prospectively to an aco's list of assigned beneficiaries beginning with the subsequent performance year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 though the beneficiary would retain their right to change their designation at any time.  the mssp currently allows a beneficiary to select an aco provider, however, only if the provider meets one of the mssp primary specialty designations.  to satisfy the bba of 2018, cms proposes to assign a beneficiary to an aco based upon his or her selection of any aco professional, regardless of specialty, as their primary care clinician.  under this definition of voluntary alignment, cms is removing the requirement that the aco professional designated by the beneficiary be a primary care physician as defined under current mssp regulations.  the bba also allows the beneficiary to align with an aco independent of whether the beneficiary has received any services from the aco provider.  this means cms is removing the requirement that a beneficiary must have received at least one primary care service from the aco professional.  the beneficiary will remain assigned to the aco in which the provider participates during the entire aco agreement period and subsequent agreement periods even if the beneficiary no longer seeks treatment from the aco.  however, cms is proposing an exception that would limit voluntary assignment when the beneficiary also is eligible for assignment to an entity participating in a cms innovation center demonstration being tested or expanded.\namga has supported efforts to improve or expand methods by which a medicare beneficiary can participate in or receive care from an aco.  at least in theory, allowing for voluntary alignment addresses two problems.  first, as lynn barr and her colleagues noted in their may 11 health affairs blog essay, an aco with 5,000 assigned beneficiaries, the program minimum, have a 10 percent chance of randomly earning shared savings.  providing additional avenues to grow an aco's assigned beneficiary population helps to some extent mitigate this problem.  voluntary alignment would as well, at least in theory, help reduce program leakage, whereby the assigned beneficiary receives some or all of their care outside their assigned aco.  for example, the january norc at the university of chicago evaluation of the next generation aco (ngaco) demonstration found that 37 percent of ngaco assigned beneficiaries received their care outside the ngaco network and 47 percent received their care both in and out of the ngaco network.  leakage is particularly problematic when aco assignment is prospective.  however, we do not believe it would be counterproductive to assign voluntarily aligned beneficiaries that have not sought care via the aco in subsequent agreement periods, particularly when agreement periods are proposed to extend to five years.  it would exacerbate the leakage problem.\nbeneficiary opt-in based assignment methodology\nin the proposed rule cms states, the agency is \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsidering implementing an opt-in based assignment methodology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  as detailed, cms \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould allow, but not require, acos to elect an opt-in based assignment methodology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  for those acos that have elected this methodology, cms would use a hybrid assignment approach that would be based on \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-ins, supplemented by voluntary alignment and modified claims-based methodology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  opt-ins would be assigned prospectively.  if the beneficiary did not opt-in or voluntarily align, then the beneficiary would be assigned under this methodology to the aco only if he or she received at least seven primary care services from one or more of the aco's primary care providers.  beneficiaries would not be assigned even if they simply received a plurality of their primary care services from the aco.  currently, only approximately 25 percent of aco beneficiaries would meet the threshold assignment of seven primary care services.  cms identifies a seven services minimum, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause it would enable such acos to focus their care coordination activities on beneficiaries who have either opted-in to assignment to the aco or voluntarily aligned with the aco or who are receiving a high number of primary care services from aco professionals and may have complex conditions requiring coordination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  acos participating under this methodology would retain their ability to select prospective or prospective with retrospective reconciliation assignment.  cms is also seeking comment on whether to establish a geographic limitation on this methodology such that the beneficiary would be limited to acos located near the beneficiary's residence.  cms argues this approach could be more preferable than an opt-in only and/or a voluntary alignment approach (where currently 92 percent of the voluntarily aligned were already assigned to the same aco using the existing claims-based assignment methodology). it would likely provide stronger statistical confidence in determining financial performance and provide stronger incentives for acos and their participants to improve care delivery.  cms is also seeking comment on whether the agency should assign beneficiaries to all acos using this hybrid assignment approach.\namga supports the proposed opt-in based assignment methodology, as long as acos can voluntarily participate.  concerning a geographic limitation, while we recognize this would be difficult to formulate, we agree in principle that there be geographic limits placed in assigning aco beneficiaries.\nrevisions to the definition of primary care services used in beneficiary assignment\ncms is proposing to amend the definition of primary care services for the purposes of aco beneficiary assignment by adding an additional six current procedural terminology (cpt) codes and three healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) codes.  the cpt codes concern advance care planning, health risk assessments, psychotherapy services, annual depression screening, alcohol misuse screening and alcohol misuse counseling.  the three hcpcs codes are those created in the recent proposed physician fee schedule rule: gpc1x; gcg0x; and, gppro1.\namga supports the use of these additional codes.\nprogram data and quality measures\nas part of the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative, cms is focused on \u00e2\u0080\u009cupdating quality measures, reducing regulatory burden, and promoting innovation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  cms also notes in the proposed rule that it is \u00e2\u0080\u009cimportant that the quality reporting requirements\u00e2\u0080\u009d under the mssp \u00e2\u0080\u009calign with the reporting requirements\u00e2\u0080\u009d under other medicare initiatives, as well as other payers, to \u00e2\u0080\u009cminimize the need for shared shavings program participants to develop excessive resources in understanding differences in measure specifications or engaging in duplicative reporting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  as part of this effort, cms is requesting comments and recommendations on how to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfurther advance the quality measure set\u00e2\u0080\u009d for acos.  as a related aside, we note in the cy 2019 medicare physician fee schedule (pfs) proposed rule, cms noted its intention to reduce the total number of quality measures in the mssp measure set by seven in an effort to \u00e2\u0080\u009creduce the burden on acos and their participating providers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nin our response to the proposed cy 2019 pfs, we repeated our concern that the agency begin to measure for value, and correlate quality and spending or outcomes achieved relative to spending.  absent measuring for value, we wrote cms has created a situation in which the medicare program is \u00e2\u0080\u009cperversely awarding earned shared savings to acos that have comparatively worse quality than the worse performing acos or those falling below their negative medical savings or loss ratio.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwe are encouraged by cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 desire to align quality measure reporting requirements across medicare programs.  as we also noted in our pfs comments, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe see no reason why the mssp and the medicare advantage program's quality measures are different.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  among numerous others, former center for medicare and medicaid innovation (cmmi) deputy director sean cavanaugh made this same argument in his recent october 3 testimony before the senate aging committee.  for example, among the proposed 24 mssp 2019 measures, less than half are also included in the medicare advantage star ratings program.  we are also encouraged cms to begin to adopt a more routine use of patient reported outcome measures.\npromoting interoperability\ncms indicated its \u00e2\u0080\u009cdesire to continue to promote and encourage\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos to use certified electronic health record technology (cehrt) and align any requirements with the macra quality payment program (qpp).  to that end, cms is proposing to add a requirement that all acos \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemonstrate a specified level of cehrt use in order to be eligible to participate\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the mssp.   concurrent with this new requirement, cms is proposing to retire the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ehr quality measure (aco-11) effective january 1, 2019.\nfor acos that do not meet the financial requirements to qualify as an advanced apm, cms is proposing to require acos to certify that at least 50 percent of their eligible clinicians use cehrt to document and communicate clinical care to their patients and other providers.  this requirement, cms notes, would align the mssp with other care delivery models, including those being tested by the center for medicare and medicaid innovation (cmmi).  of note, this requirement would not relieve mips eligible clinicians who are participating acos from their need to report in the mips promoting interoperability performance category.\ncms also is proposing that in order for an aco to qualify as an advanced apm, the aco must certify that the percentage of eligible clinicians participating in the aco meet or exceed the cehrt thresholds as required by the qpp.  current regulations set this threshold at 50 percent.  however, as proposed in the pending physician fee schedule (pfs) rule for performance year 2019, cms would require advanced apms under the qpp to meet a 75 percent cehrt threshold.  cms is seeking comment on whether this higher threshold \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay be warranted now or in the future\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the mssp.  the mssp proposal would align the cehrt requirement with the qpp regulation for those acos that meet the financial risk criteria to qualify as and advanced apm.  this effectively would impose the higher threshold requirements on the basic level e and enhanced tracks.\nshould the pfs increase the cehrt threshold requirement to 75 percent, in finalizing this proposed rule, cms should match the percent.  cehrt threshold percentages should be aligned across apm models.\ncoordination of pharmacy care for aco beneficiaries\nin the proposed rule, cms notes briefly acos stakeholders continue to express interest in improving care coordination and collaboration with medicare part d drug plans to \u00e2\u0080\u009creduce the risk of adverse events and improve medication adherence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  cms provides a number of examples of how acos and part d plan sponsors might collaborate.  for example, cms states acos and part d plan sponsors may be able to enter business arrangements to \u00e2\u0080\u009csupport improved pharmacy care coordination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms is requesting comment on how mssp acos and part d plan sponsors could work together to improve coordination of pharmacy care for medicare ffs beneficiaries.  cms also is requesting comment on what type of support medicare acos would need from cms to establish new and innovative business arrangements to promote pharmacy care coordination.  cms also is interested in existing arrangements and what current barriers to coordination exist.\namga is interested in exploring ways to improve coordination between aco providers and medicare part d plans \u00e2\u0080\u0093 while avoiding anti-kickback and related legal restrictions.  as our members and the agency are well aware, medicare spending on part d benefits will reach $92 billion this year, or more than 16 percent of net medicare expenditures.  as has been widely reported, this spending has been rapidly trending upward, as the average annual rate growth in part d costs per beneficiary has increased to 4.4% annually between 2013 and 2016, as compared to 2.4% between 2007 and 2013.  this growth is expected to continue, due in part to the costs associated with specialty drugs.  therefore, we encourage the agency to publish in 2019, a proposed rule or request for information (rfi) that outlines ways in which aco providers can, within legal and regulatory restraints, actively coordinate and/or partner with part d plans.\nextreme and uncontrollable circumstances accommodation\nin previous rule making, cms established polices for how to address quality performance, scoring, and any financial reconciliation for acos that were affected by \u00e2\u0080\u009cextreme and uncontrollable circumstances\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 namely the 2017 california wildfires and hurricanes harvey, irma, maria, and nate.  cms finalized a policy that would be applied if 20 percent or more of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficiaries resided in an emergency declared area as determined under the qpp or if the apm entity is located in such an area. now, cms is proposing to extend this policy to performance year 2018 and subsequent years.  cms also is proposing to apply these policies to the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality reporting period; if an aco is unable to submit data to cms, the agency would not be able to measure the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance. however, cms may opt not to include the quality-reporting period under the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy if the quality reporting period is extended.  cms indicated this would provide the aco with an additional opportunity to submit quality data, making additional accommodations superfluous.\nregarding the quality-reporting period, amga would ask that cms provide clarification on how the agency would determine and announce whether the extreme and uncontrollable polices are governing, or if the reporting period will be extended.  cms notes the possibility of extending the reporting period in both this proposed rule and the december 2017 interim final rule with a comment period that originally established the policies for assessing the financial and quality performance of mssp acos affected by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances.  however, cms is silent on when or why the reporting period would be extended.  before moving forward with this policy, cms should explain its decision making process.\nshould cms make a determination that an aco is facing extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, it is proposing the following.\nthe aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minimum quality score would be set to equal the mean quality performance score for all shared savings program acos for the applicable performance year.\nthe higher of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance score or the mean quality performance score for all shared savings program acos would be used for acos that are able to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompletely and accurately report all quality measures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d if the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance score is used, the aco also would be eligible for quality improvement points.\nif the aco receives the mean shared savings program quality performance score, the aco would not be eligible for bonus points awarded based on quality improvement during the applicable performance year.\nif an aco receives the mean shared savings program aco quality performance score for a performance year, in the next performance year for which the aco reports quality data and receives a quality performance score based on its own performance, cms would measure quality improvement based on a comparison between the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance in that year and in the most recently available prior performance year in which the aco reported quality.\nregarding determining the benchmark of an area affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance, cms considered adjusting the benchmark to account for disasters that occur during a benchmark year.  however, cms opted instead to rely on its regional adjustment factor policy to account for any variations in expenditures.  cms is seeking comment on this proposal.  we would refer cms to our comments on the problems with the regional blend.  absent a reform that addresses the underlying issue with the regional adjustment factor, applying it to acos in a region recovering from an extreme or uncontrollable circumstance will perpetuate the flaws.\nwe thank cms for consideration of our comments.  should you have questions please do not hesitate to contact amga's david introcaso, ph.d., senior director of public policy at (703) 842.0774 or at dintrocaso@amga.org.\nsincerely,\njerry penso, m.d., m.b.a.\npresident and chief executive officer\n\n\n", "0360": "determining participant options based on prior participation of aco legal entity - entering into new agreement on 7/1/2019 for currently participating acos.\r\n\r\nthe proposed rule indicates cms interest in allowing flexibility for acos currently within a 3-year agreement period under the shared savings program to transition quickly to a new agreement period that is not less than 5 years under the basic track or enhanced track. the proposed rule is clear that it intends to offer extensions to those acos whose agreement periods end on 12/31/2018 to allow them to apply for a new agreement for 7/1/2019 with reference to acos who start a 12-month performance year on 1/1/2019 and terminating their participation agreement on 6/30/2019 with a new agreement period beginning 7/1/2019. it is unclear, however, that this opportunity to terminate early and begin a new

mssp tracks down to two: basic and enhanced. under the basic track, eligible acos would begin under a one-sided model and incrementally phase-in risk over the course of a single agreement period. under the enhanced track, which is based on the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing track 3, acos would have the highest level of risk and potential reward. if cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal is finalized, acos would be restricted to a maximum of two years of upside-only risk, down from the current six years. ahs does not support the accelerated timeline for acos to transition to a two-sided risk model. we believe that the proposal does not take into account the reality of many providers. the journey towards accountable care is long, requiring organizations to fundamentally change their operations by adopting new legal structures, acquiring new staff, adopting new technologies and engaging in more robust data analytics. organizations need time to make these changes before taking on significant financial risk. providers must also address the opportunity costs associated with seeking to reduce inpatient admissions and shift care to lower paying sites of service. forcing providers into risk too quickly will likely result in many organizations withdrawing from the mssp. there is a learning curve associated with running an aco and organizations need an appropriate transition period that accounts for that time to learn. additionally, acos need time to realize their savings before taking additional financial risk. according to a survey from the national association of acos, organizations invest an average of $1.6 million annually to operate an aco.1 in two years, it is unlikely for an organization to have produced\n cms\u00e2\u0080\u00931701\u00e2\u0080\u0093p october

provide incentive payments to assigned beneficiaries who receive primary care services. an aco is prohibited from advertising a beneficiary incentive program. however, cms seeks comments on whether beneficiaries should be notified of the availability of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficiary incentive program via outreach materials approved by cms. additionally, cms seeks comments on how and when an aco should notify its beneficiaries of the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s availability. ahs recommends that cms provide a template for acos to notify beneficiaries about the beneficiary incentive program. this will give organizations complete certainty about the adequacy of the notification and address cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concern of acos \u00e2\u0080\u009cinappropriately steering beneficiaries to voluntarily align with the aco.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms should make available summary information about the use of the beneficiary incentive program when aco program results are released. this information will be useful to other acos as they consider implementation of the program. repayment for early termination cms proposes to adopt a new deadline, december 31st to june 30th, as the effective date of termination for acos to withdraw without liability for any portion of shared losses. cms also proposes to reduce the minimum notification period for acos that are voluntarily terminating participation from 60 to 30 days. this would allow acos to base their decision on three quarters of feedback reports, instead of two. ahs does not support the proposed termination date of june 30th for acos to avoid repayment losses. acos need sufficient time and appropriate fiscal data to ensure that the termination of an aco agreement is a sound business decision. acos should be able to terminate until at least 30 days after receipt of second quarter data without repaying losses. instituting a shorter termination deadline would leave acos with insufficient information to make termination decisions.\n election of minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss rate (mlr) by acos\n cms\u00e2\u0080\u00931701\u00e2\u0080\u0093p october 16, 2018 page 7\n 7\n

we must be able to assist physicians who are in solo or small practices make the investment in tools and technologies. to share technology enablement services with providers, we must overcome the barriers to interoperability. to develop common operation workflow, acos must be operationalized to enable physicians to focus on patient care, not on administration. and if we are to implement clinical pathways rooted in prevention, we must redesign our reimbursement system to reward providers for preventing disease, not just treating it. to achieve this, we must modernize the regulatory environment that currently slows providers down on their journey towards value-based health care delivery. if you have any questions or would like further information, please do not hesitate to

to the proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success, as published in the august 17, 2018 federal register. we express appreciation for efforts to update the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and request the agency move forward to modernize the mssp and ensure its long-term success, while incorporating our recommended policy changes in a final regulation. these recommendations reflect our desire to see the mssp achieve the long-term sustainability necessary to enhance care coordination for millions of medicare beneficiaries, lower the growth rate of healthcare spending and improve quality in the medicare program.\n naacos is the largest association of acos, representing more than 6 million beneficiary lives through 370 mssp, next generation, and commercial acos. naacos is an aco member-led and member-owned non- profit organization that works on behalf of acos across the nation to improve the quality of medicare, population health and outcomes, and healthcare cost efficiency. our members, more than many other healthcare organizations, want to see an effective, coordinated patient-centric care process.\n the aco model is a market-based solution to fragmented and costly care that empowers local physicians, hospitals and other providers to work together and take responsibility for improving quality, enhancing patient experience and reducing waste. importantly, the aco model also maintains patient choice of clinicians and other providers. while the origins of medicare acos date back to the george w. bush administration, the mssp has grown considerably in recent years and now includes 561 acos, covering\n10.5 million beneficiaries. acos have been instrumental in the shift to value-based care and a central part \n of the aco concept is to transform healthcare through meaningful clinical and operational changes to put patients first by improving their care and reducing unnecessary expenditures.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n this fall naacos conducted a poll of to collect feedback in response the pathways to success rule to solicit input about the rule to help inform our comments. the survey, conducted by naacos through a web-based questionnaire sent to all mssp acos, drew 153 responses from 127 unique acos, representing 23 percent of mssp acos. naacos released a report on the findings from the poll, which is available here. there are a number of notable results detailed in the report which we hope cms will consider as it evaluates comments. for example, when asked about their aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall level of support for the proposed rule, 27 percent of respondents report favoring the rule while more than 60 percent report opposing the proposed rule.\n the levels of support and opposition were informed by what aco respondents identified as the top opportunities and challenges in the proposed rule. specifically, 57 percent of respondents reported concern with cutting shared savings rates for many acos from 50 percent to as low as 25 percent; 51 percent reported concern with designating acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009clow\u00e2\u0080\u009d revenue and requiring more risk sooner for \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue acos\u00e2\u0080\u009d; 43 percent reported concern with shortening the time for shared savings-only acos from six years to two years; and 31 percent reported concern with capping risk adjustment at +/- 3 percent across five-year agreement periods. while risk adjustment proposals were identified as a challenge, they were also identified as an opportunity. importantly, sixty percent of acos reported that if finalized, they would have been unlikely to have entered the mssp as new acos under revised policies laid out in a proposed rule.\n in contrast, acos expressed support for a number of proposals in the rule and the top three opportunities were clear with the first, selected by over 55 percent of respondents, being the ability to choose an assignment methodology annually, regardless of mssp track or level. aco respondents noted their support for proposed changes that would expand use of payment waivers and beneficiary incentives with 42 percent of respondents selecting the expanded use of these waivers and introduction of the beneficiary incentive program as a leading opportunity proposed in the rule. citing a desire for increased program stability and predictability, slightly more than 30 percent of respondents chose the proposed shift from three-year to five-year agreements as the third most popular opportunity included in the rule.\n\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n

not cut in half the shared savings rates for shared savings-only acos and to apply the following shared savings rates: 50 percent for basic levels a and b, 55 percent for basic levels c and d, and 60 percent for basic level e \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 not to finalize the arbitrary distinction of high and low revenue acos. we oppose requirements that high revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or any acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 not require any acos to participate in the enhanced track but keep that a voluntary model for acos prepared for higher levels of risk and reward \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 update the risk adjustment methodology by allowing risk scores to change by +/-5 percent over an agreement, as opposed to the proposed +/-3 percent range, and to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 finalize policies that support the move to regional benchmarking, including maintaining the current maximum of 70 percent regional expenditures, and remove aco beneficiaries from the regional population \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 not finalize the proposal to permit cms to terminate an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement if expenditures exceed a certain amount after two performance periods \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 not finalize the proposal to establish a june 30

\u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to introduce a glidepath to higher risk between basic level e and the enhanced track and to not require participation in the enhanced track but provide it as a voluntary option for acos ready for higher levels of risk and reward.\n proposals: cms proposes that effective june 30, 2019 the agency would retire the current mssp tracks 1, 1+, 2 and 3 and would replace those with new basic (including levels a through e) and enhanced tracks effective with a transition to the new tracks beginning july 1, 2019. while there are a number of overall program changes, the new tracks and levels have overall similarities to most of the existing tracks, such that they are roughly equivalent as follows:\n current mssp track equivalent under proposed mssp structure track 1 basic level a and b track 1+ basic level e track 2 no equivalent track 3 enhanced track\n comments:\n renaming and restructuring the mssp\n we support the transition to the new basic and enhanced tracks, especially with the introduction of a more gradual glidepath to assuming risk in the basic track. this allows acos to gain exposure to risk in a more incremental manner than what is currently available in the mssp. we strongly support the permanent inclusion of the track 1+ equivalent, basic level e, which is an important option for acos assuming downside financial risk and allows loss sharing limits similar to those required for advanced alternative payment models (apms) in the quality payment program (qpp). that said, we have a number of concerns with the specific shared savings and loss rates included in the revised mssp, which are discussed in detail in later sections of this comment letter. the basic and enhanced track labels are more descriptive than the current labels for the existing mssp tracks. we recommend that should these name changes be finalized, that they stay in place moving forward to ensure continuity and understanding across the industry.\n moving from level e to the enhanced track\n while we are pleased with the more gradual glidepath to risk in the basic track, there remains a significant jump from basic level e to the enhanced track. in 2018, fewer than 7 percent of mssp acos elected to participate in track 3, the equivalent of the enhanced track. introduced in 2016, track 3 was meant to provide a more advanced option for acos ready for higher levels of risk and reward, but only a very small group of acos have chosen to participate. while the proposed rule provides some changes to the enhanced track, which also apply to other downside financial risk models in the basic track, there remains a massive jump in risk from basic level e and the enhanced track, with the latter requiring maximum losses based on total cost of care and capped at almost four times those in the basic level e. cms acknowledges this significant increase and requests feedback, stating on page 41818:\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n time limitation on participation in the basic track, acos may not prepare to take on the highest level of risk that could drive the most meaningful change in providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099/suppliers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior toward achieving the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n establishing an aco and embarking on the related transformations inherent in population health are what drives changes in provider behavior. these changes often take years to generate results, as evidenced by the increasingly positive results for acos that are in the program for a longer period of time. we point to august 2017 findings from the department of health and human services inspector general (oig) and 2017 mssp results available in the public use file as proof that acos need time to generate positive results and demonstrate change. therefore, we have concerns with the assertion that high levels of risk are the key driver with changing provider/supplier behavior which would help achieve the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals. as harvard medical school researchers j. michael mcwilliams et al noted in their report, medicare spending after 3 years of the medicare shared savings program, published in the new england journal of medicine (nejm) on sept. 20, contracts with no downside risk contracts, which appeal to smaller organizations, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaybe effective in lowering medicare spending.\u00e2\u0080\u009d we urge the agency to focus on incentivizing the care transformations tied to population health and value-based care rather than focus on requiring risk as the sole mechanism to change provider behavior.\n the significant increase in the enhanced track risk level is based on an increased shared loss rate and a much higher benchmark-based loss sharing limit. the downside financial risk models in the basic track include lower shared loss rates and a revenue-based loss sharing limit, which caps risk based on provider revenue rather than total cost of care, which is the basis for the benchmark-based loss sharing limit. the enhanced track does not include a revenue-based loss sharing limit, and we urge the agency to create one and to create more options for gradual risk increases between basic level e and the enhanced track. it is also essential that cms revise its policies to keep the enhanced track voluntary, as with track 3, and not attempt to push acos into a model with levels of risk they are unprepared to assume. requiring acos to potentially pay millions of dollars to medicare is simply not practical or feasible for most of these organizations.\n it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to recognize that acos that are not ready for such high levels of risk under the enhanced track will not move forward; they will quit the program altogether. as mcwilliams and his colleagues noted in the nejm-published research, mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benefits \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould erode if policy changes, such as requiring acos to assume downside risk after fewer years of participation, cause acos to leave the program.\u00e2\u0080\u009d using a government mandate to assume high levels of provider risk is not the solution to increasing aco participation and achieving successful results for acos. the unintended consequences of forcing high levels of risk will significantly undermine the mssp and result in diverting valuable investments in care coordination away from medicare patients and towards other patients under value- based contracts. further, the disproportionate emphasis on reducing costs often overshadows the equally important goal of quality improvement that the aco model offers, which benefits patients and the medicare program generally. while some acos have not yet been able to experience a return on the investments they have made, they have generated savings to the government while improving patient care, which studies show has a positive downstream impact on spending, but may take years to fully materialize. for example, mssp acos generated gross savings of $1.1 billion for py 2017 based on the cms methodology for setting financial benchmarks. sixty percent of acos saved medicare money in 2017 with 34 percent of acos earning shared savings and 26 percent of acos generating savings for medicare but not enough savings meet the threshold (i.e., the minimum savings rate (msr)) needed to earn shared-savings payments. these acos are on the right path, and we urge cms to support them so they continue to generate savings for medicare and positive quality for beneficiaries. success does not equal assuming risk. we urge cms to allow all acos to remain indefinitely in basic level e without being forced to move to the enhanced track.\n\n 601 13th

agreement periods from three years to five years. specifically, for agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019, the length of the agreement would be five years and six months. for agreement periods beginning on january 1, 2020, and in subsequent years, the length of the agreement would be five years. cms also proposes to remove current restrictions that prevent an aco from terminating its participation agreement and re-entering the program prior to when the existing agreement period would have ended.\n comments: we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to extend the length of agreement periods from three years to five years, which will promote program stability. extended agreement periods allow acos a longer horizon on which to plan and to benefit from efficiency gains before benchmark rebasing. many acos have expressed the desire to have more program stability and predictability and shifting to longer agreement periods will enable that. we urge cms to finalize this change as proposed. we also support the proposal to modify current restrictions that prevent an aco from terminating its participation agreement and re-entering the program before the existing agreement period would have ended. this \u00e2\u0080\u009csit out\u00e2\u0080\u009d period is unnecessary and shuts providers out of participating in an essential cms value-based program. eliminating this restriction will allow the flexibility for an aco in an agreement period to terminate its participation agreement and then enter a new five-year agreement period under one of the redesigned participation options proposed in this rule. we recommend cms finalize this as proposed.\n timeframe to transition to risk\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to finalize a policy allowing all new acos entering the program to remain in basic track level a for two years and basic track level b for an additional two years before requiring the aco to move to level c in the fifth and final year of their agreement. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos also asks cms to allow acos meeting certain performance criteria to participate for a third year in basic track level b, providing acos that demonstrate superior performance with up to five years in basic track levels a and b.\n proposals: cms proposes acos would progress from shared savings-only to risk-based models under timeframes that apply to acos differently depending largely on previous program experience and aco type (high vs. low revenue). levels a and b of the basic track would be shared savings-only models, and after two years, acos would gradually assume more risk over time as they progress along basic track levels c through e. cms proposes to automatically advance acos over time across the levels and allow acos to elect annually to move up to higher risk levels in the basic track more quickly than what is required. the new proposed structure includes a more gradual glide path for assuming risk between basic track levels a through level e. however, there remains a significant jump in the risk level required when moving from basic level e (losses capped at 4 percent of the benchmark) to the enhanced track (losses capped at 15 percent of the benchmark).\n cms proposes acos would not be permitted to switch from the basic track to the enhanced track during their five- year agreement period. however, because cms proposes to eliminate the current restriction that prevents acos that terminate during an agreement from re-entering the program before the contract would have ended, an aco could

evidence that acos save more money \n for medicare than what is reflected in basic evaluations of performance compared to cms benchmarks.\n acos have also demonstrated impressive quality results. a 2017 oig report, medicare program shared savings acos have shown potential for reducing spending and improving quality, found that acos achieved high quality and in particular noted progress on important measures including reduced hospital readmissions and screening beneficiaries for risk of falling and depression. recently released mssp performance year 2017 data shows a mean quality score of 90.5 percent out of 100 percent for acos subject to pay-for-performance measures. further, analysis of mssp performance year 2016 results shows that acos improve quality over time, with average performance improving 15 percent across 25 measures used consecutively across program years. evidence clearly shows that acos improve over time in the program and that shared savings-only models generate savings to cms and improve quality of care for the patients they serve. therefore, it is critical that cms allow acos to remain in shared savings-only models (basic track levels a and b) for more than the proposed two years.\n if finalized, there will be a detrimental effect on new applicants and participation in the aco program will be diminished. we request that cms modify proposals for all acos (including both high- and low-revenue acos) to allow more time to participate in shared savings-only models. specifically, naacos urges cms to finalize a policy allowing all new acos to remain in basic track level a for two years and basic track level b for an additional two years before requiring the aco to move to level c in the fifth and final year of their agreement. these acos should then be permitted to begin their second agreement period at basic track level d where they would participate for three years and progress to level e for the final two years of their second agreement period (with options to progress more quickly if the aco chooses). this would provide acos with four years of participation in shared savings-only models and a fifth year for those that demonstrate exceptional performance, as described below. providing acos with four years in shared savings-only models provides the aco with only two to three years of performance data, the minimum that would be necessary to identify trends and opportunities for transformation and improvement.\n naacos strongly believes acos who meet superior performance criteria should also be permitted to participate for a third year in basic track level b, allowing high performing acos to remain in a shared savings only model for a full five-year agreement period in cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed basic track. specifically, based on evaluation of the previous three performance years, we urge cms to allow acos that meet at least one of the criteria below to have a third year in basic track level b, giving the aco a full five-year agreement period in a shared savings only model:\n\n1. acos that generate net savings across three performance years: acos have demonstrated an increasing \n likelihood of achieving shared savings over time. this is likely the result of a combination of factors, such as their experience, realization of long-term commitments and investments in priorities such as care coordination, quality improvement, and data analytics. this trend is promising and means more savings over time for the medicare trust fund. however, many acos generate savings, as defined by having expenditures lower than their benchmark, but do not surpass their msr and thus do not qualify for earned shared savings. the msr in track 1 can be as high as 3.9 percent, which is a considerable hurdle. while these acos may not earn shared savings, they are saving medicare money and delivering high quality care. cms has no reason to discourage their continued participation. therefore, we urge cms to allow acos that generate net savings relative to their benchmark across three performance years (including those that do not surpass their msr) to have the option of continuing in basic track level b for a third year following their participation in basic track level a for two years.\n\n2. acos that score at or above the 50th percentile in quality in one of two performance years: acos that \n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n continuing in basic track level b for a third year following their participation in basic track level a for two years.\n\n3. acos that improve their overall quality score by 10 percentage points or greater over the course of \n performance years: acos that demonstrate a significant improvement in their quality score have made a clear investment in quality and have had a positive impact on the medicare beneficiaries. these acos should be rewarded for these efforts and provided additional time to give their investments in quality an opportunity to materialize into cost savings, rather than being prematurely forced into a two-sided risk track. therefore, we urge cms to allow acos that improve their overall quality score by 10 percentage points over the course of the two performance years the option of continuing in basic track level b for a third year following their participation in basic track level a for two years.\n adopting these changes would provide acos with the time they need to transform health care through meaningful clinical and operational changes to put patients first by improving their care and reducing unnecessary expenditures. these transformations are significant and, as such, require time for implementation and to produce measurable results. acos are investing millions of dollars of their own capital to make these care improvements, even though medicare does not recognize these start-up and ongoing investments in its calculations of aco savings, losses, and costs. further, the benefits of these transformations extend beyond the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed medicare fee-for-service patient population and have a broader effect on medicare advantage beneficiaries and even patient populations beyond medicare. finalizing cms proposals to drastically reduce the amount of time available to acos in shared savings-only models will minimize the positive impact acos have on their communities. it is critical that cms provide acos with additional time in shared savings-only models to allow for a successful transition from fee-for-service to value-based care.\n shared savings and loss rates, loss sharing limits\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms not to cut in half the shared savings rates for shared savings only acos and to apply the following shared savings rates: 50 percent for basic levels a and b, 55 percent for basic levels c and d, and 60 percent for basic level e. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos strongly recommends that cms emphasize and reward above average quality performance or improvement by providing additional shared savings on a sliding scale up to 10 percentage points. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges the agency to lower the benchmark-based level e loss sharing limit to equal macra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally applicable nominal amount standard of 3 percent.\n proposals: as shown in table a, cms proposes a number of changes to the shared savings rates for basic levels a through d, as compared to the current 50 percent shared savings rate for track 1. specifically, under the proposed one-sided model, a final sharing rate would not exceed 25 percent based on quality performance and would apply to first dollar shared savings for acos that meet or exceed their msr.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895

shared savings rates\n naacos strongly opposes major reductions in shared savings rates from the current track 1 shared savings rate of 50 percent to as low as 25 percent under the proposed basic track levels a and b. this severe reduction in shared savings would drastically halt new acos from entering the program. since the release of the proposed rule, many acos have expressed concern about these reductions and stated they would not have entered the program as new acos with these inadequate proposed shared savings rates. as noted in a comment letter to this cms proposal from researchers at harvard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshared savings rates have been low in the mssp, allowing acos in track 1 to keep no more than 50 percent of the difference between its expenditures and its benchmark. because imperfect quality scores reduce the shared savings rate, it has been even lower, averaging 44.2 percent in 2014 and 47.8 percent in 2017.\u00e2\u0080\u009d therefore, in addition to the meager proposed shared savings rates for levels a through d of the basic track, it is important to note that these shared savings rates would likely be even lower than what is proposed when cms reduces them for imperfect quality performance. naacos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 members report spending almost $2 million a year on average for mssp participation, including investments made in health information technology, population health management and aco administration. such a drastic reduction in shared savings payments will not allow acos to recoup those investments and deter future participation in such a needed value-based payment program like mssp.\n the shared savings rates have been debated numerous times with many calls to increase shared savings rates above the current 50 percent in track 1 and 1+. for example, as shown in the excerpt below from page 67929 of the november 2011 mssp final rule which initially set the mssp shared savings rates, many commenters including medpac called for much higher shared savings rates, such as 75 percent, to incentivize aco participation.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommenters suggested sharing rates ranging from 50 to 95 percent (most commonly 75 percent) under the one-sided model and 66 to 95 percent (most commonly 80 percent) under the two-sided model. medpac recommended increasing the sharing rates for both models, suggesting, for example, offering a savings rate of up to 75 percent for the one-sided model and 95 percent for the two-sided model for the first agreement period.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n benchmarks. these savings are sure to grow over more recent years as more acos participate in mssp and gain the experience needed to produce positive results.\n there have been some public comments from cms leaders that acos in shared savings-only models do not generate savings. however, recent cms data on py 2017 mssp results, available in this public use file, shows this claim is not true. acos in shared savings-only models and those with downside financial risk both had net positive savings in 2017. in fact, as shown in table 4, the savings per beneficiary was higher for acos in track 1. further, one would expect the savings to be higher for acos in models with downside financial risk as to date, acos have self- selected to move to a risk-based model, which is typically the result of being successful in the shared savings- only model.\n table 4: net savings for acos based on track track net savings to medicare (millions)* means savings per beneficiary percent acos generating savings track 1 $290 $138 33% track 2/3 $23 $55 51% *net savings factors in bonuses paid to acos\n rather than make shared savings-only models less appealing, we urge cms to focus its efforts on making models with downside financial risk more attractive while continuing to support shared savings-only models. it is essential that cms structure the program such that it includes a business model attractive enough to retain current participants while bringing in new acos to create a pipeline for acos to advance on the path to value-based care. the proposed shared savings rates will fall short of that goal. therefore, we urge cms to maintain a 50 percent shared savings rate for basic levels a and b and to apply a 55 percent shared savings rate for levels c and d and a 60 percent shared savings rate for level e.\n further, we request cms adjust shared savings rates based on quality, which is a primary goal of the aco program. unfortunately, acos that achieve high-quality performance are not rewarded through increased shared savings or higher benchmarks. in contrast, medicare advantage (ma) plans are rewarded with higher benchmarks for higher quality, which puts acos at a disadvantage. as medpac noted in its feb. 2, 2015 letter to cms, \"otherwise, the aco with top quality performance would end up with a lower benchmark than an ma plan in the same market with top quality performance. that situation could be seen as inequitable for the aco.\"\n efforts to improve quality consume aco resources and increase spending relative to financial benchmarks in the short term, even if these efforts decrease medicare spending over the long term. for example, an aco that does extensive patient outreach for cancer screening, such as colonoscopies, could expend considerable resources delivering these services, which may prevent the need for expensive late-stage cancer treatments for the screened patients. acos that make large investments to improve quality performance may be less able to keep spending below their benchmarks as a direct result of their increased investment in quality. we urge cms to use a similar approach for ma and mssp by properly rewarding acos for high quality. it is important to recognize high-quality performance compared to established measure thresholds as well as to recognize \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and reward \u00e2\u0080\u0093 quality improvement relative to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous performance. therefore, to emphasize and reward above average quality performance or improvement, we urge cms to provide on a sliding scale up to 10 percentage points of additional shared savings.\n shared loss rates\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n at 20 percent and 25 percent respectively. this supports a gradual ramp up of assuming risk under an asymmetric approach.\n loss sharing limits\n cms notes the proposed approach for determining loss sharing limits would tend to place acos that include hospitals under a benchmark-based loss sharing limit because the participants of these acos typically have higher total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue compared to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark. we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to apply a loss sharing limit that is the lesser of the revenue-based or benchmark-based threshold. this allows flexibility for acos and does not place them in a particular category as a result of their aco participant composition. we recommend cms finalize this as proposed.\n we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to set the loss sharing limits for level e so those acos continue to qualify for advanced apm bonuses under the qpp established by the 2015 medicare access and chip reauthorization act (macra). however, we urge the agency to lower the benchmark-based level e loss sharing limit to equal the macra generally applicable nominal amount standard, rather than setting it one percent higher, as proposed. this would result in a level e benchmark-based loss sharing limit of 3 percent for 2019, which reflects the level of risk cms considers sufficient for macra advanced apms. this represents a more gradual increase in risk and aligns with the approach used for the revenue-based loss sharing limit, which is proposed to be set equal to, not higher than, the macra generally applicable nominal amount standard.\n cms explains that the agency would determine an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loss sharing limit annually at the time of financial reconciliation. while the agency notes this is consistent with its current process for track 2 and 3 acos, the timing of this determination is troubling. financial reconciliation occurs months after the close of the performance year, meaning acos would face uncertainly about their maximum potential losses until after the performance year is over. one of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals with the proposed rule is to promote predictability and stability, a goal shared by naacos. however, not knowing the maximum amount of losses an acos may face creates significant uncertainty that undermines cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on improved predictability and stability. participation in mssp tracks 2 and 3 remains low, and the uncertainty about potential losses is one of the reasons that has prevented more acos from joining these downside financial risk models. we urge cms to learn from this lesson and provide the loss sharing limit determination prior to or at the start of the performance year rather than at the time of financial reconciliation.\n high revenue and low revenue aco designations\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms not to finalize the arbitrary distinction of high and low revenue acos and opposes requirements that high-revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or any acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms not to require any acos to participate in the enhanced track but to keep that a voluntary model for acos prepared for higher levels of risk and reward. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos recommends cms reinstate advanced funding opportunities to help acos assume risk.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n ownership or operational interests but would focus on participant revenue compared to benchmarks. the proposed definitions of high revenue and low revenue acos are as follows:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 high revenue aco means an aco whose total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue of its aco participants is at least 25 percent of the total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 low revenue aco means an aco whose total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue of its aco participants is less than 25 percent of the total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries\n the total aco revenue of participants would be based on revenue for the most recent calendar year for which 12 months of data are available, as would the total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries. cms notes that that low revenue acos tend to be smaller, physician-led, and rural acos, which the agency explains are less likely to have access to capital to assume risk. therefore, cms considers but does not propose benefits to low revenue acos, such as providing them with a lower msr in levels a and b (1 or 2 percent) or using a higher shared savings rates such as 50 percent for levels a through d. cms notes that hospital- or health system-based acos will typically be considered high revenue acos, but hospital-based acos with relatively low aco participant ffs revenue compared to their benchmark would be low revenue acos.\n comments: in the proposed rule, cms states its belief that acos whose participants have greater total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue relative to their benchmarks have more ability to control costs and may be better financially prepared to move to greater levels of risk. accordingly, the agency notes that its comparison of revenue to benchmark would provide a more accurate method for determining an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preparedness to take on additional risk rather than an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-reported information regarding the composition of its aco participants and any ownership and operational interests in those aco participants. we do not support the current self-reporting requirements for track 1+ that result in acos falling under the revenue- or benchmark-based track 1+ loss sharing limits. we have previously urged cms to provide track 1+ acos flexibility to select either a revenue- or benchmark-based loss sharing limit, and we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to apply the lesser of the revenue- or benchmark-based loss sharing limit for basic level e.\n while we appreciate removing the self-reporting requirements under track 1+, we question the need to further divide acos into arbitrary categories of high and low revenue acos and to apply different schedules for how and when they must progress along the risk continuum. the proposed 25 percent threshold appears arbitrary and creates division where none should exist. we oppose categorizing acos in this manner and urge cms to not finalize the high and low revenue distinctions. all acos should be on the same path to assuming risk as recommended in this letter, which should include a gradual ramp up of risk, sufficient shared savings rates, and the ability to participate indefinitely in basic level e without having to move to the enhanced track.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n\n the proposed high and low revenue distinctions create unnecessary program complexity, which cms has taken great strides to try to reduce across a variety of medicare programs in recent months. furthermore, the move creates uncertainty for acos who may have a difficult time predicting the category in which they would fall. this distinction would also change over time as aco participant composition changes, adding more complexity and making long-term planning very difficult. this uncertainty would be further compounded by the timing of the cms high/low revenue determination, which the agency explains would not occur until after the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application is submitted. should cms move forward with a high/low revenue distinction, we urge cms provide the final determination as early as possible in the application process, baring notable participant changes during the process which would change the determination. given the significance of this determination, acos must know in advance into which category they would fall.\n while we appreciate the gradual ramp up of risk in the basic track, the overall restructuring of the mssp has considerably more complexity with cms evaluating whether acos are new, renewing or re-entering, experienced or inexperienced with performance-based risk, high or low revenue, etc. eliminating the high/low revenue distinction would help minimize some of the complexity and would remove a significant amount of work required by cms and acos to model, predict, and determine if the aco would be high or low revenue.\n the administration has made comments about supporting market solutions and level playing fields among competitors. we appreciate that perspective and respectfully point out that this proposed policy is contrary to a market-based approach whereby all competitors have similar opportunities for success. rather than finalize unnecessary and arbitrary distinctions for acos, cms should work to support all acos as they progress on the value- based care continuum, and the agency should create meaningful incentives for acos to assume risk. the goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients, and cms should adopt policies that continue to engage hospitals as key players rather than create incentives to exclude hospitals as aco participants. the best way to drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate to innovate and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare. medpac addressed this in its june 2018 report noting, while hospitals may have certain conflicting interests that create challenges for aco participation, hospitals should continue to be part of acos.\n the administration has also noted concerns that acos are a potential driver of consolidation in the healthcare industry. there are no studies or data supporting this claim, which is a flawed assumption. reduced payment rates, increased regulatory burdens and requirements to assume risk are actual drivers of consolidation, and organizations often consolidate to more efficiently manage these challenges. further, acos do not drive physician employment and many effective acos engage a majority of independent clinicians. acos support greater clinical integration and collaboration among doctors, hospitals and other care providers and align the payment system to incent coordination and cost savings across these silos. this alignment accomplishes what the model is designed to do, and what providers need out of high-value networks, without necessitating consolidation and direct employment of physicians. in fact, these opportunities to collaborate often help providers avoid consolidation. the greatest fear related to consolidation is its potential to lead to higher prices. ultimately, one of the best ways to protect against escalating costs is to advance alternative payment models that hold providers accountable and rewards them for improving care and reducing costs for an entire population.\n in addition to our recommendations not to finalize the distinction between high and low revenue acos, we recommend that cms support acos by reinstating advanced funding opportunities to enable acos to assume risk. the agency previously offered programs to help fund acos up front, with those payments later recouped via shared savings. these programs, such as the aco investment model (aim) or similar ones, should be reinstated to help acos fund activities and transformations early on in acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 development.\n\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac

allow acos in downside financial risk models to select a symmetrical msr/minimum loss rate (mlr) but requests acos be able to update this selection during an agreement period. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to lower the msr for shared savings-only models to be set between 2.0 and 2.5 percent.\n proposals: in order to qualify for a shared savings payment, or to be responsible for sharing losses with cms, an aco's average per capita medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for its assigned beneficiary population for the performance year must be below or above the updated benchmark, respectively, by at least the msr/mlr. for acos under basic track levels a and b, cms proposes to use the same sliding scale for the msr that is currently used for track 1, which is based on the number of beneficiaries assigned to the aco to establish the msr.\n prior to entering a model with downside financial risk (basic levels c, d, e or the enhanced track), cms proposes to continue to have an aco select a symmetrical msr/mlr. this selection would be made as part of the application cycle prior to entering a model with downside financial risk and the selection would apply for the duration of the applicable agreement period. the aco would be able to choose from the following options, consistent with current policy: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 0 percent msr/mlr \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 symmetrical msr/mlr in a 0.5 percent increment between 0.5 and 2.0 percent \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 symmetrical msr/mlr that varies based on the number of beneficiaries assigned to the aco\n the variable msr/mlr would be determined based on the number of assigned beneficiaries as is currently used for two-sided model acos that have selected the variable option. cms also proposes to use a variable msr/mlr when performing shared savings and shared losses calculations if an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population falls below 5,000 for the performance year, regardless of whether the aco selected a fixed or variable msr/mlr.\n comments: we support allowing acos in models with downside financial risk to continue to have choices with selecting a symmetrical msr/mlr and request cms finalize this proposal. this flexibility is important for acos who may want to set an msr/mlr higher or lower depending on how conservative or aggressive their goals are for earning savings and having to repay losses. given the extended five-year agreement periods cms proposes, we urge the agency to allow acos to change their msr/mlr at the start of a performance year rather than be locked into that decision for up to five years of an agreement period.\n while the secretary has a statutory requirement to determine as msr based upon the number of medicare ffs beneficiaries assigned to an aco, there is no specific statutory requirement for msrs to rise as high as 3.9 percent for smaller acos. this creates a significant hurdle for smaller and rural acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 groups of providers cms has vowed to help \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to earn savings and thus a disincentive to join the mssp. we urge cms to use its authority to lower that threshold and revise the msr schedule for acos based on beneficiary population size such that the cap on msrs for smaller acos is 2.5 percent, and to meet statutory requirements, for larger acos would be set as low as 2 percent.\n early termination

cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to establish a june 30 deadline to voluntarily terminate aco participation agreements. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to provide acos with the ability to engage with high performing providers by allowing acos to select their participants by national provider identifier (npi) rather than solely at the tax identification number (tin) level.\n proposals: beginning on january 1, 2019, cms proposes to monitor whether an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expenditures for assigned beneficiaries population are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning that the expenditures exceed either the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative msr under a one-sided model or the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mlr under a two-sided model. if the aco is negative outside corridor for one performance year, cms proposes the agency may take pre-termination actions, including requiring a corrective action plan. if the aco is negative outside corridor for another performance year, cms proposes the agency may immediately or with advance notice terminate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement. cms also seeks comment on whether acos should be permitted to obtain reinsurance. cms proposes to reduce the minimum notification period from 60 to 30 days for early termination. this would allow acos considering a year-end termination to have three quarters of feedback reports, instead of two. for acos that voluntarily terminate after the june 30 deadline, cms proposes to pro-rate the shared-loss amount by the number of months during the year in which the aco was a participant in the program. cms also proposes to pro-rate shared losses for acos in two-sided models that are involuntarily terminated by cms. to calculate the prorated share of losses, cms will multiply the amount of shared losses calculated for the performance year by the quotient equal to the number of months of participation in the program during the performance year, including the month in which the termination was effective, divided by 12. cms also proposes special rules for acos that participate for a portion of a six-month performance year during 2019 (january 1, 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093june 30, 2019 or july 1, 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0093december 31, 2019):\n\n1. if the aco terminates its participation agreement effective

option to participate for the first six months of the year prior to terminating their current agreement and entering a new agreement period beginning july 1, 2019. cms proposes these acos would be eligible for prorated shared savings or losses for the six-month period from january 1, 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 june 30, 2019.\n comments: naacos has deep concerns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal

should not cause the aco to be deemed a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad actor\u00e2\u0080\u009d or penalized by being terminated from the program. while we support addressing valid program integrity concerns, we urge cms not to consider slightly elevated spending as evidence of fraud, waste and abuse.\n further, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside the corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d sets a very low bar, especially for acos in downside financial risk models where the aco can select an mlr as low as 0 percent. many acos view selection of the msr/mlr in a two-sided model as a significant incentive to move into a model with downside financial risk, but this proposal would create a double edge sword whereby an aco that wants to take on greater accountability through a lower mlr would be faced with potentially being kicked out of the program as a result of spending that exceeds their mlr. this proposal also does not make sense in the context of acos assuming risk, whereby once they meet or exceed their mlr they must pay back a portion of losses to medicare. requiring these acos to repay losses protects the medicare trust fund, and it is unnecessary at the same time to implement program policies aimed at removing acos from the program for having higher than expected spending.\n should the agency move forward with this type of early termination policy, at a minimum it should be used only in rare cases where the agency specifically has documented program integrity concerns. alternatively, naacos encourages cms to better serve beneficiaries and american taxpayers by creating a direct channel for acos to report suspected fraud and abuse. value-based delivery models such as acos have a unique vantage point and the properly aligned incentives to identify and ultimately report fraud. on average, a medicare aco is assigned 17,000 lives and includes hundreds of clinicians. its success depends on an aco continuously monitoring its expenditures. because acos are held responsible for the total cost of care for their assigned beneficiaries, acos are also monitoring services rendered by clinicians outside the aco and keep an eye on reimbursements completely removed from their own financial interests other than to achieve shared savings. that close attention to beneficiaries and the services they are accessing through medicare provides acos a frontline perspective to identify and report suspicious activity, yet acos have no direct access to cms program integrity. making this change would better support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stated fraud and abuse goals.\n should cms finalize its proposal to retain the right to terminate an aco whose expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the agency must use a more appropriate standard to identify acos who would be subject to such a policy. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed approach would monitor specifically for whether the expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries exceed the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark by an amount equal to or exceeding either the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative msr under a one-sided model or the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mlr under a two-sided model. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed policy would have identified 82 acos in 2017 under these proposed criteria. of the 142 acos that earned shared savings payments for 2017 performance and had program experience prior to 2017, 36 percent had losses (i.e., expenditures higher than benchmarks) in one of their first two years of the program. such a policy would have removed these acos from the program prematurely, before they were able to go on and demonstrate success. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed policy is far too broad and contrary to the stated intent of the proposal to identify \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad actors\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the program.\n cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed approach is overreaching and it is critical that cms not move forward with this policy. further, should cms finalize this approach, the agency must also establish an appeal process for individual acos to submit information regarding errors they believe were made in the financial reconciliation calculation, determining the amount of shared savings earned by the aco or in determining an aco was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside the corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d. currently, cms does not provide a meaningful appeal process for individual acos. if cms will retain the right to terminate an aco for exceeding certain spending thresholds, cms must apply the materiality threshold to individual acos and allow acos to appeal redetermination decisions they believe were made in error and, therefore, hold acos harmless for errors the agency makes in the payment determination process.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900

to 30 days would provide more time for acos to evaluate program data and performance before deciding to terminate from the program without financial reconciliation for that year.\n we have significant concerns regarding the june 30 deadline proposed for acos electing to voluntarily terminate from the program. we urge cms not to finalize this policy as using a june 30 deadline for voluntary termination would mean that acos would not have the data they need to make an informed choice about their continued participation in the program. that data would not be available until later in the year due to the timing of distributing performance reports. acos should have three quarters of experience available to them to make a decision about their continued participation in the program.\n risk adjustment\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to implement the same risk adjustment policy across medicare programs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 as an interim step to implementing consistent risk adjustment policies across medicare programs, naacos supports the proposal to modify mssp risk adjustment by eliminating the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to allow risk score changes during an agreement period but urges the agency to use a more appropriate range of +/- 5 percent and to cap the risk ratios in aggregate across the four beneficiary enrollment types.\n proposals: cms proposes to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries for the purposes of mssp risk adjustment. the agency also proposes to use a symmetric +/-3 percent risk ratio cap between the performance year renormalized risk score and the most recent benchmark year for all assigned beneficiaries. cms would continue to use full cms-hierarchal condition category (hcc) risk adjustment for all assigned beneficiaries between the benchmark period and the performance year, and the risk scores would continue to be renormalized within each of the four beneficiary enrollment types. similarly, cms would continue to use full cms- hcc risk scores when resetting or rebasing the historical benchmark prior to each new agreement period.\n comments: risk adjustment modifies costs to reflect beneficiary health status and plays a critical role in enabling more accurate comparisons across acos and providers that treat beneficiaries of varying clinical complexity. there have been long-standing concerns about the mssp risk adjustment methodology, which cms acknowledges in the proposed rule, stating on page 41884:\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe appreciate the concerns regarding our current risk adjustment methodology raised by stakeholders, who have indicated that the current approach may not adequately recognize negative changes in health status that occur at the individual beneficiary level, particularly among continuously assigned beneficiaries who have experienced an acute event, such as a heart attack, stroke, or hip fracture, between the third benchmark year and the applicable performance year. we recognize that such acute events, which almost always require a hospitalization, are likely to have an upward impact on cms-hcc risk scores that is not attributable to provider coding initiatives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n participate in the mssp. as an interim step to implementing the same risk adjustment policy across medicare programs, we offer the following recommendations in response to those proposals in the pathways to success rule.\n the current mssp policy that treats beneficiaries differently depending on whether they are considered newly or continuously assigned creates unnecessary confusion and complexity. cms is in effect limiting risk adjustment due to demographic factors for continuously assigned beneficiaries. it is unreasonable to assume a provider organization, however effective, can manage a population such that patient conditions never worsen over time and it never carries a higher disease burden. therefore, we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to eliminate the newly and continuously assigned beneficiary categories and recommend additional changes to the risk adjustment proposals.\n we appreciate aspects of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow risk scores for beneficiaries to change somewhat over time, which begins to recognize the reality that patient risk scores fluctuate. it is essential that benchmarks reflect these risk changes so that acos are fairly judged on their performance without being unfairly expected to manage an overall population\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease burden with virtually no changes during an agreement period. naacos has repeatedly advocated for cms to permit meaningful increases in beneficiary risk scores over time. while the proposal would permit an increase of up to 3 percent, it is important to note that 3 percent is across a five-year agreement period and is not a year-over-year increase.\n though we appreciate the agency allowing risk score increases, the selection of 3 percent is arbitrary and insufficient when applied across a five-year agreement. for example, assuming that an aco starts in july 2019, the most that the risk score used in the updated benchmark calculation can change in performance year six (2024) would be between 97 to 103 percent of the 2018 risk score (based on 2017 hcc coding practices). this risk adjustment proposal would be reasonable in early years of the agreement period, when most acos would hit the 3 percent cap, but it would not be reasonable when applied to later years of the agreement. using mssp py 2017 results, 87 percent of acos would have had at least one enrollment type trigger the +/-3 percent cap when looking at the first three years of the agreement period. the average percentage capped in the first performance year of the agreement period is 88 percent, in the second performance year is 85 percent and the third performance year is 92 percent. over the fourth and fifth performance years we would expect the percentage of acos affected by the risk score cap to increase. we recommend cms finalize a policy that allows risk score adjustments during the course of the agreement period, but we urge a more reasonable threshold of +/- 5 percent. this is the threshold at which the percentage of capped aco populations within the same enrollment type drops below 25 percent based on the 2017 mssp results.\n alternative to the proposal, we support cms capping the risk ratios in aggregate across the four beneficiary enrollment types (esrd, disabled, aged/dual eligible, and aged/non-dual eligible). the different enrollment types show significantly different cap rates with aged/dual the highest at 59 percent capped and aged/non-dual the lowest at 24 percent capped in 2017 due to smaller sample sizes and volatility for certain enrollment types. we recommend cms finalize capping the enrollment types in aggregate instead of separately by enrollment type conjunction with the broader +/- 5 percent cap in order to further promote benchmark stability.\n finally, in order to reduce benchmark volatility, the risk adjustment model version should be consistent between the baseline and performance years. for example, the version 23 cms-hcc model could be used when comparing risk scores in the 2016-2018 baseline period to those in the 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2024 performance period. the next generation aco program follows this convention demonstrating that it is administratively feasible to maintain a consistent risk adjustment model version throughout the baseline and performance periods.\n benchmarking methodology\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south,

regional expenditure component to 50 percent and recommends that agency maintain the current maximum of 70 percent of regional expenditures in the third agreement and subsequent agreement periods. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos does not support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a symmetric +/- 5 percent cap based on national per capita expenditures and recommends the agency not finalize this. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to find an appropriate balance between a national and regional trend rate, but instead of finalizing the proposal we request the agency remove aco beneficiaries from the regional reference population to address the underlying problem. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to reverse its position on adjusting rebased benchmarks to account for the average per capita amount of savings generated during an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous agreement period by adding those savings back to the rebased benchmark. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to adjust the mssp benchmarking methodology to remove certain expenditures such as those related to mips payment adjustments, cpc+ care management fees and hospital wage index changes.\n proposals: cms proposes a number of benchmarking changes that, if finalized, would go into effect along with the revised mssp structure. many of the proposals relate to incorporating a regional expenditure component into the rebased benchmark, a direction the agency finalized in 2016 with the mssp rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 revised benchmark rebasing methodology, facilitating transition to performance-based risk, and administrative finality of financial calculations (published in the june 10, 2016 federal register). under that regulation, which remains in place as existing policy, cms incorporates a growing component of regional expenditures into benchmarks as they are rebased for new agreement periods. in this rule, cms proposes to incorporate regional expenditures into benchmarks sooner, beginning with initial agreement periods and to cap the maximum amount of regional expenditures at 50 percent. this would modify the phase-in schedule such that acos would have a regional expenditure component of:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 25 or 35 percent during the first agreement period, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 35 or 50 percent during the second agreement period, and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 50 percent during third and subsequent agreement periods.\n consistent with current policy, acos with spending higher than their region would receive the lower adjustment, and acos with spending lower than their region would receive the higher adjustment. cms also proposes to introduce a symmetric +/- 5 percent cap, implemented separately for each beneficiary category, and based on national per capita expenditures. if an aco is considered a re-entering aco, cms proposes to apply the regional adjustment percentage that was used in the most recent agreement. cms also proposes to use a blend of national and regional trend factors to trend forward benchmark year (by)1 and by2 to by3 when determining the historical benchmark and a blend of national and regional update factors to update the historical benchmark to the performance year (or to calendar year 2019 in the context of determining the financial performance of acos for the six-month performance year from july 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019). the national component of the blended trend and update factors would receive a weight equal to the share of assignable beneficiaries in the regional service area that are assigned to the aco, computed by taking a weighted average of county-level shares. the regional component of the blended trend and update factors would receive a weight equal to 1 minus the national weight.\n comments: naacos supports incorporating a component of regional expenditure data into aco benchmarks. rather than exclusively relying on regional expenditure data we specifically support blending aco historical and regional expenditure data for rebased benchmarks. relying exclusively on regional expenditure data for rebased benchmarks would not properly reflect an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique patient population. relying exclusively on historical aco expenditure data creates an unattainable situation where acos have decreased ability to beat ever-lowering benchmarks. if executed correctly, using benchmarks with a blend of historical and regional expenditure data will attract new acos while retaining existing participants and ultimately improve the long-term viability of the program.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n we support the proposal to introduce a regional expenditure component into the initial agreement period, rather than waiting until at least the second agreement period. this is especially important with longer, five-year agreement periods. we also strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued application of one of two regional expenditure components based on how the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending compares to that of its region, and the proposed 25 percent and 35 percent thresholds are appropriate. we recommend cms finalize these as proposed.\n as cms gradually introduces regional expenditures, for third and subsequent agreement periods we urge the agency not to finalize its proposal to cap regional expenditures at 50 percent. this is a decrease from the current policy of applying a maximum of 70 percent regional expenditure data. this policy was finalized two years ago and given the phase-in schedule of regional expenditure data, acos have not yet reached this level so it is premature to reverse this policy. we support a maximum of 70 percent of regional expenditures in the third agreement and subsequent agreement periods and recommend the following phase-in schedule such that acos would have a regional expenditure component of:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 25 or 35 percent during the first agreement period, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 45 or 60 percent during the second agreement period, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 70 percent during third and subsequent agreement periods\n we also urge cms to allow an option for acos to gradually incorporate regional expenditure data by 10 percent annually into their benchmarks during an agreement period. some acos will face significant swings in their aco benchmarks as a result of the revised methodology and allowing a gradual implementation would ease this transition rather than require acos to face large swings at the start of an agreement period. we reiterate our recommendation that this should be an option, and acos that are prepared to face more significant changes at the start of an agreement should be permitted to do so. overall, acos would ultimately reach the 70 percent regional benchmark, but providing program flexibility would keep acos progressing on the right path in a more reasonable manner that incentivizes them to stay in the program and continue focusing on reducing costs and improving quality.\n in response to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a symmetric +/- 5 percent cap based on national per capita expenditures, we are concerned that this will unnecessarily limit market forces that would naturally constrain outliers resulting from implementation of regional expenditures into rebased benchmarks. in the proposed rule, cms notes its concern that the agency should guard against the effect of large positive or negative regional adjustments resulting from the revised benchmarking methodology by imposing a cap on the dollar amount of the regional adjustment. however, we do not agree that cms should intervene in the market in this manner and instead should allow competition among acos and other providers to address and eventually mitigate outlier situations. should the agency move forward with implementing such a cap, we recommend a more reasonable range of +/- 7 percent as opposed to +/- 5 percent.\n in response to concerns raised by naacos and others, cms proposes to no longer use a pure regional update factor, which disadvantages acos that make up a large portion of the market in their region. instead, cms proposes to modify the update factor by using a national-regional blended trend rate that would be based on the share of assignable beneficiary weighted national ffs and regional update factors. the national-regional blending factor would be determined by averaging the market penetration across all counties where the aco has assigned beneficiaries. this proposal is a step in the right direction to address some of our concerns with the regional update factor; however, we have concerns that the new methodology may over-emphasize the national trend component. there are pitfalls with solely using a national update factor, which ignores important local market dynamics and regional trends, and with using an exclusively regionally-based update factor, which as currently structured penalizes acos in rural areas and those that comprise a large share of their market and, therefore, drive regional trends.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n address the underlying problem caused by including aco beneficiaries in the population from which the regional expenditure data is drawn. in fact, a simpler solution to the proposed national-regional trend rate would be to remove aco beneficiaries from the regional reference population as naacos has previously recommended. by excluding aco beneficiaries from the regional reference population, the situation where an aco is being directly evaluated against itself within the same performance year is eliminated.\n naacos and others have repeatedly made this recommendation to cms, including in our comment letter in response to the 2016 mssp rule, and our concerns remain the same. rather than comparing acos to themselves and other acos, cms should compare aco performance relative to ffs medicare by defining the regional population as assignable beneficiaries without aco-assigned beneficiaries for all acos in the region. at the very least, cms should exclude the aco itself from the region to prevent an otherwise tautological comparison that essentially double counts those aco-assigned beneficiaries. in an area where the aco has significant market saturation, it is especially essential to remove the aco beneficiaries from the regional population to avoid comparing the aco to itself.\n excluding all aco-assigned beneficiaries (those involved in mssp acos and well as other cms aco demonstrations such as the next generation model) also allows for a cleaner comparison between acos and ffs. by including the aco-assigned beneficiary population, the regional cost data is skewed by reflecting acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to coordinate care and reduce expenditures for the aco population. cms has expressed concerns that removing aco-assigned beneficiaries would result in an insufficient reference population. however, according to our analysis based on 2017 data, if cms removed aco-assigned beneficiaries from the service area no acos would have a reference population smaller than about 300,000 beneficiaries. further, the contribution of beneficiaries from very small and aco- dominated counties to the regional benchmark is minimal with only 47 (10 percent) 2017 acos exposed to one or the other, with such counties contributing only as much as 4 percent of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall assigned population. continuing a flawed program methodology in order to address a small percentage of acos is nonsensical and, more importantly, harmful to the majority of program participants. we urge cms to modify its policy by changing the definition of the reference population to exclude all aco-assigned beneficiaries.\n to address those acos whose reference population falls below 5,000 after removing the aco-assigned beneficiaries, we recommend cms use a modified approach to reach 5,000 beneficiaries in those instances. for example, cms could bridge the gap by increasing the weight of the counties that have a lower proportion of resident aco beneficiaries, and thus higher ffs population. another option would be for cms to expand the regional service area to include assignable beneficiaries in adjoining counties until a sufficient comparison group is reached. yet another option, recommended by medpac in their march 11, 2016 comment letter to cms, would increase the stability of the regional ffs spending calculations by increasing the number of years of data included in the calculation. for example, by using a five-year rolling average for county level spending estimates. in cases where area expenditures are driven largely by the acos, cms could similarly pull in contiguous counties to ensure a fair comparison. these approaches would both address cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concern about not having an adequate reference population and would be preferable to the current methodology.\n additionally, we recommend cms consider using a prospectively determined trend rate which would allow for greater predictability of financial results by acos. for example, prospective trend in us per capita cost is used to establish trend rates in the next generation model and medicare advantage programs. it is recommended that similar prospective trend approach be used in the mssp. finally, we urge cms to reverse its position on adjusting rebased benchmarks to account for the average per capita amount of savings generated during an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous agreement period by adding those savings back to the rebased benchmark. cms has changed its policy on adding aco savings back to benchmarks a few times, and the most recent policy finalized in the june 2016 mssp rule no longer adds these savings to benchmarks. this final policy was disappointing considering cms had previously expressed support for adding the savings back to benchmarks and in a june 2015 mssp rule stated:\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n who have achieved success in achieving the three-part aim in their first agreement, by lowering expenditures and improving both the quality of care provided to medicare ffs beneficiaries and the overall health of those beneficiaries. absent this adjustment, an aco who previously achieved success in the program may elect to terminate its participation in the program rather than face a lower benchmark that reflects the lower costs for its patient population during the three most recent prior years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (80 fr 32778)\n savings generated by acos are achieved as a result of their hard work to improve quality and lower costs. acos should be accountable for their performance relative to ffs medicare in their region and rewarded \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not penalized - for previous savings. thus, we urge cms not only to account for the earned shared savings in rebased benchmarks, but also to account for all savings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and add that amount to rebased benchmarks. at a very minimum, cms should return to the policy in the 2015 mssp rule which accounts for a portion of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s savings in rebased benchmarks.\n along with the benchmark adjustments discussed above, we urge cms to implement other benchmark adjustments so as to not hold acos accountable for specific expenditures that are inconsistent between the benchmark and performance years. for example, cms should adjust benchmarks to hold constant changes from the hospital wage index, as these payment changes can be notable and are not reflective of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population management efforts but can dramatically effect on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to accurately demonstrate savings or losses.\n as discussed previously in this letter, we also urge cms to exclude mips bonuses as aco expenditures. the current cms policy unfairly punishes acos for their high performance by both requiring track 1 acos (and basic levels a, b, c and d as proposed) to participate in mips, excluding such acos from advanced apm bonuses and counting any mips bonuses earned for high performance in that program as aco expenditures. cms excludes advanced apm bonuses from aco expenditures and should do the same for mips expenditures. this will be increasingly important over time as mips bonuses rise in future program years. not removing mips bonuses as aco expenditures will result in fewer acos being able to surpass their msr and could cause acos in basic levels c and d to have to repay losses. cms makes claim-level adjustments by adding sequestration costs back to paid amounts when calculating aco expenditures and should follow a similar policy to adjust for mips payment adjustments. it was not the intent of congress to penalize acos in mips, and therefore cms must alter this policy.\n finally, we urge cms to remove cpc+ care management fees from aco expenditures. while we appreciate the opportunity for mssp primary care practices to participate in cpc+, the care management fees should not be included as expenditures for aco benchmarks. these funds are paid to the participant tins and should be viewed as separate from other payments for furnishing care to beneficiaries. by not removing these care management fees from aco expenditures, cms penalizes acos with practices that receive these payments which are often used to invest in care coordination activities that will provide long-term benefits to patients. this creates an unhelpful tension between cpc+ and acos, rather than an approach that would harmonize the two programs. we urge cms to address this by removing cpc+ fees from aco expenditures.\n 2019 participation options\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to provide next gen acos with the opportunity to participate in the revised mssp using the july 1 start date.\n proposals: cms is opening a new round of applications for 2019 with a shortened six-month performance period in 2019 due to the late nature of the regulation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release. for aco agreements that expire at the end of 2018, acos will have the option to extend current agreements for six months while offering a special, one-time july 1, 2019 start date for new agreements. the july 1, 2019 start will have a spring 2019 application period, and this start date option is also available to new acos. cms staff have also confirmed with naacos that as proposed acos within current agreement periods under mssp participation options (track 1, track 2, or track 3) would be able to complete the remainder of their current agreement under the existing financial models and requirements.\n program participation options are limited in some cases for acos with experience in a performance-based risk model as well as for acos designated as high revenue. additionally, participation options are determined in part based on whether cms considers an aco to be new, renewing, or re-entering. cms proposes to allow new acos to begin in level a of the basic track, and they would stay in the shared savings-only option (level b in performance year (py) 2) for the first two consecutive performance years. only acos that are inexperienced with performance-based risk can elect to participate in the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glidepath. acos identified as experienced with performance-based risk must enter the basic track at level e if considered a low-revenue aco and must enter in the enhanced track if considered a high-revenue aco. low-revenue acos could participate in the basic track for up to two agreement periods, while high-revenue acos would be restricted to one agreement period in the basic track.\n cms proposes to define \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing acos\u00e2\u0080\u009d as those that continue in the program for a consecutive agreement period without a break in participation and are either:\n1. acos whose participation agreements expired and they immediately enter new agreement periods to \n continue participation in the program; or\n2. acos that voluntarily terminated their current participation agreements and they immediately enter new \n agreement periods to continue participation in the program.\n cms proposes to define \u00e2\u0080\u009cre-entering acos\u00e2\u0080\u009d as those that do not meet the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d and are either:\n1. the same legal entity as (a) an aco whose participation agreement expired without having been \n renewed; or (b) an aco whose aco participation agreement was terminated, or\n2. a new legal entity with more than 50 percent of its aco participants included on the aco participant list \n of the same aco in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date. re- entering acos are ineligible for level a and must begin at level b of the basic track.\n cms proposes to define acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced with performance-based risk\u00e2\u0080\u009d if either of the following are met:\n1. the aco is the same legal entity as a current or previous participant in a performance-based risk \n medicare aco initiative; or\n2. 40 percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco \n initiative in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n finally, cms defines \u00e2\u0080\u009cperformance-based risk medicare aco initiative\u00e2\u0080\u009d as: basic track, enhanced track (track 3), track 2, track 1+ model, pioneer aco model, next generation aco model, and comprehensive end-stage renal disease (esrd) care model two-sided risk tracks. all acos can elect to participate in the enhanced track. tables 6 and 7 in the proposed rule on pages 41833-41834 summarize participation options for low- and high-revenue acos based on applicant type and the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience with risk.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc

participation and gather all of the required information to submit applications, it is critical that cms continue to offer a participation option for 2019. naacos has concerns regarding complexity caused by the introduction of two, six- month performance periods with some acos operating under current program rules and others operating under new program rules. we request that cms clarify how such details will be handled (please see our detailed comments below under \u00e2\u0080\u009cassessing six-month performance periods in 2019\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\n in addition, we urge cms to provide acos with agreements expiring in 2018 the option of extending their current participation agreements from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019. providing this option would give acos additional time to analyze program changes and prepare for the application process while reducing complexity. cms must also provide acos with opportunities to add and delete participants throughout the performance periods offered in 2019 and clarify when such opportunities will be permitted.\n additionally, naacos urges cms to provide next gen acos with the opportunity to participate in mssp using the july 1 start date option. cmmi has finalized many changes for the final two years of the next generation model, 2019 and 2020, and some acos have concerns about certain revisions. as such, we urge cms to work closely with cmmi to provide an opportunity for interested next gen acos to transition to mssp effective july 1, 2019 without having to sit out of an accountable care model for the start of 2019. allowing a smooth and timely transition will enable interested acos and providers to avoid disruption in their accountable care goals while moving from one program to the other.\n naacos supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to define acos re-entering or renewing. however, we disagree with the proposal to limit participation options for acos with any experience in performance-based risk models. particularly in cases where the aco may have only participated in such a model for one performance year, we do not feel it is justified to limit an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation to either the basic level e or enhanced track options. additionally, as noted previously in this comment letter, the levels of risk required for the enhanced track are a large jump from those required in basic level e. given this dramatic increase, cms should not force acos to participate in the enhanced track. instead, we recommend cms only limit an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation to basic level e if such aco had completed at least one agreement period in a performance-based risk model. further, and echoed in our comments above on the proposed high/low revenue distinction, we do not support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to require high revenue acos with experience in performance-based risk models to participate in the enhanced track. in fact, we urge cms not to finalize the arbitrary distinction of high- and low-revenue acos, and we oppose requirements that high-revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or any acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e.\n assessing six-month performance periods in 2019 key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos appreciates cms proposals to offer aco participation options in 2019. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed policies governing how shared savings and losses will be calculated for the six-month performance periods in 2019. however, cms must clarify and provide additional education to acos concerning how certain operational details will be addressed. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms must clarify how quality reporting would take place for six-month performance periods that will be based on 12 months of data and how such reporting will be considered in mips.\n proposals: cms proposes to reconcile the financial and quality performance of acos that participated in the mssp in 2019. given the varying participation options in 2019, cms proposes to treat each six-month period separately for purposes of calculating financial and quality performance. these calculations would be reconciled based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance during the entire 12-month calendar year, but cms would prorate the calendar year shared savings or losses based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance during the applicable six-month period.\n january 1, 2019 to june 30, 2019\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900

retrospective reconciliation, the assignment window would be calendar year 2019. for acos under prospective assignment, cms proposes the assignment window would be october 1, 2017 through september 30, 2018, with beneficiaries remaining prospectively assigned to the aco at the end of calendar year 2019 unless the beneficiary meets certain exclusion criteria. lastly, beneficiary assignment would be based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certified aco participant list for the agreement period beginning january 1, 2019.\n benchmark cms proposes to calculate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark and assigned beneficiary expenditures as though the six-month performance year were the entire calendar year. the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark would be determined according to the applicable methodology of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s track and agreement with cms, except that data from the entire calendar year 2019 would be used in place of data for the six-month performance year for the benchmarking approaches cms currently uses to update and adjust historical benchmarks. thus, the existing methodology would be used to determine the benchmark for the january 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 june 30, 2019 performance year by performing the following calculations: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 benchmarks would be adjusted for changes in severity and case mix between benchmark year three and calendar year 2019 using the current hcc risk score and demographic factors methodology; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 benchmarks would be updated to calendar year 2019 according to the methodology for using growth in either national or regional medicare ffs expenditures, depending on whether the aco is in its first or second agreement period and whether the second agreement period began in 2016 or 2017\u00e2\u0080\u00932019.\n financial performance cms would apply the methodology for determining shared savings and losses according to the track the aco is participating in on january 1, 2019, with the following exceptions to the applicable methodology implemented to calculate the expenditures for assigned beneficiaries over the full calendar year for purposes of determining the shared savings and losses for the six-month performance year: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 average per capita medicare parts a and b services expenditures for calendar year 2019 would be calculated for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance year assigned beneficiary population; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms would compare the expenditures to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark, determined for calendar year 2019 as listed above; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms would apply the msr or mlr, if applicable; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms would prorate any amounts of shared savings or losses by multiplying those amounts by 50 percent, which represents the portion of the calendar year covered by the six-month performance year.\n quality performance for acos participating in tracks where shared savings or losses are affected by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance, cms would multiply the difference between the updated benchmark expenditures by the applicable msr or mlr based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance.\n july 1, 2019 to december 31, 2019\n cms proposes to apply the same general methodological steps for calculating prorated shared savings and losses as described above for the six-month performance year from january 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 june 30, 2019, except where the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreement and track stipulates a different methodology, for example, the benchmarking methodology or financial calculations specific to the track in which the aco participates.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac

urge cms to allow acos currently participating using prospective assignment who extend current agreements through june of 2019, the option to use the same assignment window for the july- december performance period to avoid unintended consequences and complexity caused by creating two assignment windows for these acos. additionally, cms must clarify how quality reporting will take place for six-month performance periods that cms states will be based on 12 months of data. in the proposed rule, cms notes the agency would use the certified aco participant list for the performance year starting on july 1, 2019, to determine the quality reporting samples for the 2019 reporting period for certain acos (acos that enter an agreement period beginning on july 1, 2019, including new acos, and acos that extended their prior participation agreement for the six-month performance year from january 1, 2019, to june 30, 2019, as well as acos that start a 12-month performance year on january 1, 2019, and terminate their participation agreement with an effective date of termination of june 30, 2019, and enter a new agreement period beginning on july 1, 2019). if an aco extends its participation to the first six months of 2019 but does not enter a new agreement period beginning on july 1, 2019, cms proposes to use the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest certified participant list (the aco participant list effective on january 1, 2019) to determine the quality reporting samples for the 2019 reporting period. beneficiary assignment for purposes of generating the quality reporting samples would be based on the assignment methodology applicable to the aco during its six-month performance year. given this, we assume all acos would only be responsible for reporting quality one time, during the typical january to march timeframe following the performance year. cms must clarify how such quality reporting will take place. cms must also clarify how such quality reporting will satisfy mips quality reporting requirements for acos subject to mips.\n beneficiary notification requirements key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos disagrees with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assumption that the current beneficiary notification process is underutilized, and we urge cms to maintain the current beneficiary notification process. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we recommend cms instead simplify marketing requirements to allow acos the flexibility to communicate more effectively with patients about the program.\n proposals: cms proposes to modify the current beneficiary notification requirements and instead would require a standard written notification be provided annually to medicare ffs beneficiaries at their first primary care visit of the performance year in the form and manner specified by cms. beginning july 1, 2019, the aco would also be required, as part of the beneficiary notification process, to inform the patient about the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to, and the process by which, he or she may identify or change identification of a primary care provider for purposes of voluntary alignment. under this proposal, an aco participant would be required to provide this notice during a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first primary care visit in the six-month performance year from july 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019, as well as the first primary care visit in the 12-month performance year that begins on january 1, 2020 and in all subsequent performance years. this notice would be in addition to the existing requirement that an aco participant must post signs in its facilities and make standardized written notices available upon request. comments: naacos recommends cms maintain current beneficiary notification requirements. cms previously implemented and later removed a requirement to provide a written annual beneficiary notification. cms made this change in response to confusion among beneficiaries and based on comments from acos the notification requirement was too burdensome. specifically, cms revised the requirement so that aco providers/suppliers must post signs in their facilities and by make the notice available to beneficiaries upon request. cms notes the agency is revisiting the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing requirement to ensure beneficiaries have a sufficient opportunity to be informed about the program and how it may affect their care and data. cms also notes concern that the existing information on the program is provided to patients in separate resources, which may be time consuming for beneficiaries to compile and may be underutilized.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n burdens on acos by proposing acos use a template notification provided by cms, naacos notes that previously cms provided template language that was confusing to patients. this confusion prompted numerous calls and questions, and it distracted clinicians from proving patient care. as a more effective alternative, we recommend cms maintain current beneficiary notification requirements and allow acos increased flexibility to communicate with patients about the program using methods, such as including language on the aco websites as well as phone- recorded messages. currently, aco communication to beneficiaries is limited due to unnecessary marketing requirements preventing communication with a patient. these requirements inhibit an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to explain the benefits and services provided by acos. cms must allow acos to invest resources in the ways the organization finds most effective. this requirement is unnecessary and therefore a drain on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s limited resources. therefore, naacos urges cms to not finalize its proposals and instead focus on simplifying aco marketing requirements to provide acos with more flexibility in communicating effectively with the patients and community they serve.\n beneficiary assignment changes\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports the proposal to modify the definition of primary care services to include additional services if finalized as proposed in the 2019 medicare physician fee schedule (mpfs) proposed rule. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos strongly supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to provide acos with more flexibility in selecting a prospective or retrospective assignment methodology on an annual basis, and we urge cms to finalize this proposal. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms to reconsider its proposal to include specialists in the voluntary alignment process when a beneficiary elects such a professional as their primary care clinician, if the beneficiary does not receive primary care services from an aco professional in the aco. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos opposes cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed introduction of a new optional assignment method, the beneficiary opt- in assignment methodology, and instead we urge cms to improve upon the current voluntary alignment process by creating an automated system to support this assignment methodology.\n proposals: cms proposes to revise the definition of primary care services to include the following healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) and current procedural terminology (cpt) codes: (1) advance care planning service codes, cpt codes 99497 and 99498; (2) administration of health risk assessment service codes, cpt codes 96160 and 96161; (3) prolonged evaluation and management or psychotherapy service(s) beyond the typical service time of the primary procedure, cpt codes 99354 and 99355; (4) annual depression screening service code, hcpcs code g0444; (5) alcohol misuse screening service code, hcpcs code g0442; and (6) alcohol misuse counseling service code, hcpcs code g0443. in addition, if finalized as proposed in the 2019 mpfs proposed rule, cms would add these three new hcpcs codes to the mssp assignment methodology: (1) gpc1x add-on code, for the visit complexity inherent to evaluation and management associated with certain primary care services; (2) gcg0x add-on code, for visit complexity inherent to evaluation and management associated with endocrinology, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, urology, neurology, obstetrics/gynecology, allergy/immunology, otolaryngology, or interventional pain management-centered care; and (3) gpro1, an additional add-on code for prolonged evaluation and management or psychotherapy services beyond the typical service time of the primary procedure.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n program-wide. cms also clarifies that this proposal would have no effect on the voluntary alignment process that exists currently.\n additionally, cms proposes to provide more flexibility in choosing prospective or retrospective assignment for basic and enhanced acos, as required by the bipartisan budget act (bba). specifically, for acos entering agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years, cms proposes to allow acos annually to elect the beneficiary assignment methodology (i.e., preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation or prospective assignment) to apply for each remaining performance year within their agreement period. cms also proposes to provide an opportunity for acos to switch their selection of beneficiary assignment methodology on an annual basis, which would be done prior to the start of a new performance year.\n finally, as required by the bba, cms proposes adjustments to the voluntary alignment process. cms proposes to modify current policies to assign a beneficiary to an aco based upon his or her selection of any aco professional, regardless of specialty, as his or her primary clinician. under this proposal, a beneficiary may select a practitioner with any specialty designation as his or her primary care provider and be eligible for voluntary alignment assignment to the aco in which the practitioner is an aco professional. currently the aco professional designated by the beneficiary must be a primary care physician as defined at \u00e2\u00a7425.20, a physician with a specialty designation included at \u00e2\u00a7425.402(c), or a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist. cms proposes to use a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designation to align the beneficiary to the aco in which his or her primary clinician participates even if the beneficiary does not receive primary care services from an aco professional in that aco. cms proposes that the agency will not assign a beneficiary to the aco when the beneficiary is also eligible for assignment to an entity participating in a model tested or expanded under section 1115a of the act under which claims-based assignment is based solely on claims for services other than primary care services and for which there has been a determination by secretary that a waiver is necessary solely for purposes of testing the model.\n comments: naacos supports the proposal to modify the definition of primary care services to include additional services if finalized as proposed in the 2019 mpfs proposed rule. assignment is a critical program methodology that determines the beneficiary population for which an aco is held accountable. cms should continue to refine the primary care codes used in assignment to ensure the list used for acos is consistent with current billing practices. naacos also strongly supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to provide acos with more flexibility in selecting a prospective or retrospective assignment methodology on an annual basis, and we urge cms to finalize this proposal. naacos has long advocated for cms to provide acos with this much needed flexibility, and we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal.\n naacos has concerns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals to modify the voluntary alignment process to include specialists in the voluntary assignment process if the beneficiary elects such a professional as his/her primary clinician. specifically, we have concerns regarding unintended consequences of this policy, and we request cms not to finalize this proposal. we recommend at a minimum if cms finalizes its proposal to include specialists in the voluntary alignment process it use an approach that overrides the existing claims-based assignment methodology only when a beneficiary has at least one qualified primary care service (based on the existing services used for mssp assignment) during the previous or current performance year with an aco professional as defined under step 1 or step 2 of mssp assignment.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac

complexities and would be confusing to beneficiaries. one of the unique aspects of the aco program is that the organization cares for all patients in the same manner, not knowing who will ultimately be attributed to the aco for the purposes of program calculations to determine quality and cost metrics for the aco. this results in acos treating all patients as potentially included in their aco and results in high quality, coordinated care for all beneficiaries. the current voluntary patient alignment option launched in 2017 has been underutilized and creates confusion among beneficiaries. we urge cms not to finalize the new beneficiary opt-in approach and continue to make any patient alignment options voluntary.\n naacos has long advocated for cms to incorporate voluntary alignment, and we were pleased that cms finalized its decision to do so in the final 2017 mpfs. however, as this option was only introduced beginning with performance year 2018, there are several areas cms must improve on to increase use of the option by beneficiaries. the functionality to designate a primary clinician was added to the mymedicare.gov website in june 2017. if a beneficiary has existing favorite clinicians from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy health\u00e2\u0080\u009d web page on mymedicare.gov, he or she can select \u00e2\u0080\u009cadd as my primary clinician.\u00e2\u0080\u009d if a beneficiary does not have a mymedicare.gov account, one must be created. beneficiaries can receive assistance with mymedicare.gov, including help to set up an account and/or designate a primary clinician by calling 1-800-medicare (1-800-633-4227). the my medicare help page notes that a primary clinician is the healthcare provider that a beneficiary believes is responsible for coordinating his or her overall care. once a beneficiary aligns to a qualifying clinician in an aco, he or she will be assigned to that aco until he or she removes the clinician as primary practitioner or he or she no longer meets the beneficiary eligibility assignment requirements or the requirements necessary for voluntary alignment. this process can be cumbersome and time consuming for beneficiaries unfamiliar with cms website. we recommend cms modify the voluntary alignment process by allowing beneficiaries to make this designation over the phone by calling the 1-800-medicare or through the physician compare website. we also request cms include more information in beneficiary communications about the importance of this designation and the role acos play in providing high quality, coordinated and efficient care. we urge cms to implement these changes and to consult with acos as the agency works to further improve the voluntary alignment process.\n payment rule waivers\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to finalize its proposal to expand eligibility for the skilled nursing facility (snf) three- day rule waiver to include acos participating in a two-sided model under preliminary prospective assignment. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms to finalize the proposal to include snf services furnished under swing bed arrangements, as this proposal addresses concerns of acos in rural areas that have fewer available snfs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand certain telehealth waivers to treat the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home as an originating site and not apply the originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services furnished by a practitioner participating in two-sided aco models. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms to implement proposed telehealth waiver changes effective july 1, 2019, consistent with the proposals for the expansion of the snf waiver, to increase access and use of the waiver by acos. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to consider adding other critical patient engagement tools for acos, such as allowing npi-level participation, permitting acos to establish post-acute care networks, providing acos with upfront funding for transportation services, waiving certain post-discharge home visit supervision requirements to allow for broader use of these services by acos when clinically appropriate and afford all acos with the ability to provide waived co-payments for primary care services provided by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s providers to encourage patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use of these services.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n for quarters 1, 2, and 3 of the performance year for snf services provided after the beneficiary first appeared on one of the assignment lists for the applicable performance year. cms also clarifies that, for purposes of determining eligibility to partner with an aco for the snf three-day rule waiver, snfs include providers furnishing snf services under swing bed arrangements. in these instances, the three-star quality rating requirement would be waived.\n cms also proposes beginning with performance years 2020 and beyond, the agency would treat the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home as an originating site and not apply the originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services furnished by a physician or practitioner participating in an applicable aco. cms proposes to apply these policies to acos under a two-sided model that participate under the prospective assignment method, not a preliminary prospective assignment method.\n comments: naacos strongly supports cms proposals to expand access to certain payment rule waivers for acos participating in performance-based risk models. these tools serve as critical patient engagement tools necessary for success. we urge cms to finalize its proposal to expand eligibility for the snf three-day rule waiver to include acos participating in a two-sided model under preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation. we also appreciate the proposal to include snf services furnished under swing bed arrangements, as this proposal addresses concerns of acos in rural areas that have fewer available snfs. while we support these changes, we also urge cms to streamline the current snf waiver process that is burdensome and therefore results in fewer acos using the waiver. specifically, we recommend cms alter the current requirements that the patient has been evaluated and approved for admission to the snf within three days prior to the snf admission by an aco provider/supplier that is a physician, consistent with the aco's beneficiary evaluation and admission plan. instead, we urge cms to also allow other qualified healthcare professionals to evaluate the patient and approve the admission to the snf. requiring a physician to see the patient is arbitrary and results in unnecessary delays that do not improve the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care. further, snf affiliates must have and maintain an overall rating of three stars or higher under the cms five-star quality rating system. as a result, acos must currently continually look up a snf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality rating which is time consuming and adds significant burden. under the bundled payments for care improvement advanced (bpci-a) program, cms provides by email an xls file to participants with a list of snfs that are approved by cms to participate in the three-day rule waiver available in bpci-a. we recommend cms take a similar approach with acos to minimize burden associated with the current process.\n naacos also supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand certain telehealth waivers to treat the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home as an originating site and not apply the originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services furnished by a practitioner participating in two-sided aco models. however, we urge cms to implement such proposal effective july 1, 2019, consistent with the proposals for the expansion of the snf waiver, to increase access and use of the waiver by acos. acos consider telehealth a crucial tool for improving care coordination and reducing costs. in addition to these waivers, we urge cms to consider adding other critical patient engagement tools for acos, as detailed below.\n allowing npi-level participation/network management\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n manage patient care as a team, and the aco would communicate with these providers about the cost and quality implications of their care decisions\n allowing acos to establish post-acute care networks\n cms does not currently allow acos to encourage patients to seek care from providers the aco has identified as most efficient and high quality. unlike ma program, acos are unable to provide incentives for beneficiary engagement with the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most efficient providers. this in turn creates challenges for the aco in communicating with beneficiaries regarding their preferred providers for treatment. these are the providers engaged with the aco and focused on providing coordinated, high quality care. naacos recommends cms allow acos the same opportunities that are currently provided to ma plans to increase beneficiary engagement through incentives for beneficiaries choosing high quality, efficient providers that work collaboratively with the aco, particularly for post-acute care providers to ensure aco patients receive the highest quality care. in order to facilitate this request, cms must also provide more transparency around post-acute care admissions and quality metrics for post-acute care providers.\n providing acos upfront funding for transportation services\n lack of transportation is often cited as a barrier to healthcare access and can lead to missed appointments, delayed care, and ultimately poorer health outcomes. this issue is especially important for effectively managing patients with chronic diseases, who require more appointments and timely healthcare interventions as well as ongoing medication management. a literature review of research on this issue found that patients with a lower socioeconomic status had higher rates of transportation barriers to ongoing healthcare access than those with a higher socioeconomic status. this is a critical issue that, if addressed, could help to improve health outcomes, particularly for the patients that most need ongoing care. therefore, we recommend cms provide funding for acos to deliver transportation services to allow beneficiaries to seek the treatment they need. this could be provided as an upfront payment or as a defined member benefit. the transportation benefit could be billed by the healthcare provider, for example, providing eight trips for the patient and thereby giving transportation to and from the office for four visits for the patient. other payers currently utilize this approach, such as humana and providence health plan, and could be used as models.\n post-discharge home visits and primary care co-payments\n additionally, we urge cms to waive certain post-discharge home visit supervision requirements to allow for broader use of these services by acos when clinically appropriate. we ask that cms allow physicians to contract with licensed clinicians to provide these home visit services using general instead of direct supervision requirements specified at 42 cfr \u00e2\u00a7 410.32(b)(3). this will provide all acos with needed flexibility during the critical post-discharge time period. finally, we ask cms to afford all acos with the ability to provide waived co-payments for primary care services provided by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s providers to encourage patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use of these critical services. cms should afford all acos with every opportunity for success in reducing costs for their patients by allowing acos to use these high-value services, and we request that these waivers apply to all acos participating in performance-based risk models.\n providing acos upfront funding for social services\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n acos with funds similar to the accountable care organization investment model (aim) program, providing targeted advanced loan payments to acos to provide such services.\n beneficiary incentive program\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a beneficiary incentive program for certain acos. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms provide the necessary funding for the beneficiary incentive program, as is done in the next generation aco program.\n proposals: cms proposes to allow any aco in track 2, levels c, d, or e of the basic track, or the enhanced track to establish a cms-approved beneficiary incentive program to provide incentive payments to eligible beneficiaries who receive qualifying services. as required by the bba, cms proposes a $20 payment limit, updated annually consistent with the consumer price index and rounded to the nearest dollar, and made no later than 30 days after the service. a beneficiary would be eligible to receive an incentive payment if the beneficiary is assigned to an aco through either preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation or prospective assignment.\n cms proposes the aco legal entity, not any participant providers or suppliers, must furnish the incentive directly to the beneficiary and that incentives must not be cash but may be cash equivalent (e.g., check or debit card). incentives must be non-medicare covered items and services, and acos must keep records of all incentive payments. cms proposes that acos must fully fund the costs of operating the beneficiary incentive program, including the cost of any incentive payments. acos are prohibited from accepting or using funds furnished by an outside entity, including, but not limited to, an insurance company, pharmaceutical company, or any other entity outside of the aco, to finance its beneficiary incentive program.\n cms proposes that incentive payments made by an aco shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating benchmarks, estimated average per capita medicare expenditures, and shared savings. cms also proposes to disregard incentive payments made by an aco for purposes of calculating shared losses. lastly, cms proposes a requirement that acos publicly report for each performance year the total number of beneficiaries who receive an incentive payment, the total number of incentive payments furnished, hcpcs codes associated with any qualifying payment for which an incentive payment was furnished, the total value of all incentive payments furnished, and the total type of each incentive payment (e.g., check or debit card) furnished.\n comments: naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a beneficiary incentive program for certain acos. as discussed above, such patient engagement tools are critical to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to better manage a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care. while we support this proposal, we have concerns with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to implementation, which would require the aco fully fund the costs of such a program. there are numerous upfront costs required to establish and maintain an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations. acos invest these dollars to support the model and efforts to transform patient care, sometimes never realizing these investment costs. those acos that do earn shared savings do not see such funds until years after the upfront investments have been made. therefore, it is unreasonable to expect the aco to fully fund the costs of such a program, and we urge cms instead provide such funding as is the case in the next generation aco program. at a minimum, cms should consider funding the program for the first year to support the cost of running such a program.\n quality changes\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms to clarify that acos subject to the mips would not be required to report promoting interoperability (pi) and would instead see pi performance category weights redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative and asks that cms consider not only whether a measure is a process measure, but also whether the measure is considered a low-value process measure, before removing from aco quality measure sets. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to consider the addition of opioid use measures for potential inclusion in aco quality measure sets in future program years, and we recommend certain changes to such measures as detailed below. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms to exclude mips bonuses from aco expenditures.\n proposals: cms proposes to discontinue use of the quality measure 11 that assesses an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligible clinicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 level of adoption of cehrt. instead, cms proposes that for performance years starting on january 1, 2019 and subsequent performance years, acos in a track or a payment model within a track, which does not meet the financial risk standard to be an advanced apm, must attest and certify upon application to participate in the mssp and subsequently as part of the annual certification process that at least 50 percent of the eligible clinicians participating in the aco use cehrt to document and communicate clinical care to their patients or other health care providers. acos would be required to submit this certification in the form and manner specified by cms.\n cms also seeks feedback on ways to reduce burden and focus on meaningful quality measures as part of their meaningful measures initiative. under this initiative, cms states it is working towards assessing performance on only those core issues that are most vital to providing high-quality care and improving patient outcomes with an emphasis on outcome-based measures, reducing unnecessary burden on providers, and putting patients first.\n finally, cms is also considering the addition of one or more measures specific to opioid use to the aco quality measures set. the potential benefits of such policies would be to focus acos on the appropriate use of opioids for their assigned beneficiaries and support their opioid misuse prevention efforts. specifically, cms is considering the following relevant national quality forum (nqf)-endorsed measures with emphasis on medicare individuals with part d coverage who are 18 years or older without cancer or enrolled in hospice: nqf 2940, use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer; nqf 2950, use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer; nqf 2951, use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer.\n comments: naacos strongly supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to remove aco measure 11 and instead rely on attestation to evaluate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of cehrt. we appreciate cms responding to naacos requests to remove this measure and as a result rely on attestations as is done in the next generation aco model. we ask cms to clarify that acos subject to mips would not be required to report pi and would instead see pi performance category weights redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories. we agree that removal of this measure will reduce significant regulatory burdens; acos subject to mips (basic track levels a through d as proposed) should not be unfairly excluded from this policy. all acos demonstrate a commitment to use of ehrs, including acos in models not categorized as advanced apms. we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative and, in this role, we feel cms must also look to reduce the regulatory burden on acos to comply with mips requirements to the fullest extent possible. this includes making all program criteria and scoring methodologies for acos specifically accessible and transparent.\n as cms looks to future quality measure changes for acos, we urge the agency to consider not only whether a measure is considered a process measure but also what relative value the measure provides, when considering the burden associated with data collection and reporting of the measure. further, as cms considers annual measure changes, we note that each measure change results in administrative costs, such as changing work flows and ehrs for data collection and reporting.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n measurement and use of clinical practice guidelines to ensure patients have access to safer, more effective chronic pain treatment while reducing the number of people who misuse, abuse, or overdose from these drugs. cms specifically considers the following nqf-endorsed measures with emphasis on medicare individuals with part d coverage who are 18 years or older without cancer or enrolled in hospice: nqf 2940, use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer; nqf 2950, use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer; nqf 2951, use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer. we recommend changes to nqf 2940; this measure should instead align with the centers for disease control and prevention guidelines identifying patients for whom opioid prescriptions exceed 90 morphine milligram equivalents. it is important to include these measures on dose and duration of opioids prescribed. however, we urge cms to initially make such measures pay-for-reporting only as the measures are further refined with stakeholder input for use in the aco program.\n finally, we urge cms to exclude mips bonuses as aco expenditures. the current cms policy unfairly punishes acos for their high performance by both requiring track 1 acos (and basic levels a, b, c and d as proposed) to participate in mips, excluding such acos from advanced apm bonuses and counting any mips bonuses earned for high performance in that program as aco expenditures. cms currently excludes advanced apm bonuses from aco expenditures and we reiterate our request for cms do the same for mips expenditures. this will be increasingly important over time as mips bonuses are projected to rise in future program years. while aggregate program data has not yet been made available by cms, many acos have already reported perfect or nearly perfect scores in mips for 2017. these bonuses will then count against the aco when expenditures are calculated for purposes of mssp calculations. therefore, the better an aco and its eligible clinicians perform in mips, the greater they will be penalized when calculating shared savings/losses for the aco. this is an unfair and untenable policy. although cms argues that the agency has maintained this policy under the value-based payment modifier program, naacos believes cms has the authority and ability to remove mips expenditures from aco benchmark calculations. in fact, cms does make claim-level adjustments by adding sequestration costs back to paid amounts when calculating aco expenditures. it was not the intent of congress to penalize acos in mips, and therefore cms must alter this policy.\n repayment mechanisms\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to remove the requirement for tail period coverage and to lower the repayment mechanism amounts for basic track levels c, d and e. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand the acceptable institutions providing a repayment mechanism to include any insured institution, including credit unions. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports using the most recent data available to establish a repayment mechanism amount, requests cms increase the threshold that would trigger a higher repayment mechanism amount and provide symmetry by allowing decreases in repayment mechanism amounts during an agreement period. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos requests that cms provide new repayment mechanisms, including reinstating reinsurance and introducing an option for a future withhold of medicare payments.\n proposals: as with current risk-based models, acos in the revised mssp would be required to demonstrate their ability to repay losses by establishing a sufficient repayment mechanism, including funds placed in escrow, a letter of credit, a surety bond, or a combination of those mechanisms. the agency proposes to expand the acceptable institutions providing a repayment mechanism to include any insured institution, including credit unions. the agency also proposes to extend the duration of the repayment mechanism, which would need to be in place for the number of risk-based years in the agreement period plus an additional 24 months of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctail coverage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms proposes to use the most recent calendar year having 12 months of available data to establish the repayment mechanism amount.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n amount equal to 1 percent of total assigned beneficiary expenditures (benchmark-based standard). the agency notes its efforts to minimize administrative burdens by proposing that acos with a repayment mechanism would be permitted to extend its duration for the basic or enhanced tracks. in the event that any of the following occur, cms proposes that the repayment mechanism may be terminated.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 shared losses have been fully repaid for all performance years. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms has exhausted the amount. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms determines that shared losses are not owed.\n comments: securing a repayment mechanism is a regulatory burden, which is time consuming and costly for acos. many acos cite the burden and cost of securing a repayment mechanism as reasons not to move to a risk-based aco model. instead of requiring a repayment mechanism that pays banks and brokers and takes money away from the aco executing its core mission of improving patient care, we urge cms to remove the repayment mechanism requirement when an aco can prove that it has an investor or financial backer with a demonstrated high credit rating. financial backers could include outside investors, insurers or hospitals or health systems that are involved with the aco and providing financial support, which would be available should losses occur. this assurance would protect the medicare trust fund in the event the aco has losses while avoiding the financial inefficiency and regulatory burden of involving outside financial institutions as third parties that benefit from the repayment mechanism requirements. this would also eliminate the need to have a 24-month tail period.\n the additional burden of a 24-month \u00e2\u0080\u009ctail period\u00e2\u0080\u009d heightens concerns and increases financial requirements for acos. should cms maintain requirements for a repayment mechanism, we request the agency to minimize this regulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for tail period coverage, which is especially important considering the longer agreement periods cms proposes. should the agency retain a tail period, we also urge the agency to ensure that cms is equally liable to pay for additional shared savings if discovered up to 24 months following the agreement period and this should be noted in the mssp participation agreements.\n we further recommend cms reduce the repayment mechanism requirements, especially for the lower risk basic track levels c, d and e. for these levels, cms should only require a guarantee equal to 0.5 percent of total benchmark expenditures or 1 percent of ffs revenue.  those amounts are sufficient to prompt third-party due diligence and establish credit worthiness within the probable range of shared losses. this reduction makes sense especially in light of the 30 percent loss sharing rate in these levels that correspondingly reduces the likelihood of net losses.\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand the acceptable institutions providing a repayment mechanism to include any insured institution, including credit unions. this would provide more options than the current requirement to only utilize federal deposit insurance corporation-insured institutions. allowing access to credit unions may provide more economical alternatives and increase market competition, which could potentially lower the overall cost of accessing repayment mechanisms. we recommend cms finalize this expansion of acceptable institutions as proposed.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005

window, such as 60 days, for acos changing repayment mechanisms. updating repayment mechanisms may happen over time as a result of organizational changes, needs, and availability of specific repayment mechanisms.\n we also request that cms provide new repayment mechanisms, including reinstating reinsurance and introducing an option for a future withhold of medicare payments as repayment mechanisms. we request cms restore reinsurance as a qualifying repayment mechanism, which it was until cms removed it in the june 2015 final mssp rule. the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rationale for doing so was that few acos were using this option. however, we question that logic considering how few risk-bearing acos there were at that time. further, despite limited initial use of reinsurance for demonstrating ability to repay losses to cms, this continues to be an option which some acos pursue separate from their cms obligations. therefore, we see no harm in cms reinstating reinsurance as an option, and we urge cms to do so for all two-sided aco tracks/models.\n under the macra financial risk standards, the agency may allow a reduction of payment rates to the apm entity and/or the apm entity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligible clinicians as one option for repaying losses. we urge cms to develop an option for acos to repay losses through reduced payment rates of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligible clinicians in future years. through this mechanism, cms would identify the tin/ npi combinations that participate in the aco for a specific performance period and, similar to downward payment adjustments under mips, cms would reduce the payment rates for those tin/npis by a certain percent in a future payment adjustment year to recoup the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s losses. acos would include language in the agreement between the aco and its participant tins and their individual practitioners detailing specifics of this repayment mechanism. allowing acos to choose this as one of the mechanisms to repay losses would provide a new option that some acos may prefer over repaying losses in a lump sum. we urge cms to work collaboratively with us to further develop this concept and the key details that would be needed to implement it.\n extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to revise the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy to provide a trend/growth rate that is the higher of the national assignable rate or the regional rate. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we strongly recommend cms award a quality score that is the greater of the quality score earned in the performance year affected by the extreme circumstance, the prior year quality score, or the national mean quality score. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms should consider introducing ways to more accurately account for impact of natural disasters, for example, identifying ways to identify natural disaster related impact at the beneficiary and claims level through the use of modifiers that account for unsafe place of discharge which could be added to claims after the impact of a natural disaster.\n proposal: cms previously established policies beginning with performance year 2017 and every year that follows, for using an alternative approach to calculate acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cost and quality performance if deemed affected by an \u00e2\u0080\u009cextreme and uncontrollable circumstance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms seeks feedback on this policy.\n comments: we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughtful analysis and proposals related to accounting for the impact of a natural disaster on an impacted aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shared losses and quality. cms proposes a more aggressive transition to risk. therefore, these policies are even more critical to protect acos unfairly harmed by expenses and quality changes beyond their control as a result of a natural disaster. as acos have been impacted by several natural disasters in recent years, more data are available to deeply analyze the effect of such extreme and uncontrollable circumstances on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900

and therefore experience with how such events affect an aco. based on this experience, we recommend several changes to the current extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy.\n trend rate without changes to the current policy, natural disasters will negatively affect mssp acos and therefore affect the long-term sustainability of the program and the medicare trust fund. the current policy prorates shared losses by multiplying the shared losses by two factors: the percentage of the total months in the performance year affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance and the beneficiaries who reside in an area affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance. this adequately addresses acos that are expected to have shared losses based on performance prior to a natural disaster and have increased shared losses after a natural disaster. however, the current policy does not address an increase in annual per capital expense as compared to the benchmark/msr/mlr. this point is particularly sensitive around msr and mlr values where very small changes can have large or 100 percent impact on shared savings or shared losses when either the msr or mlr is exceeded.\n the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current policy relies on \u00e2\u0080\u009cuse of natural disaster payment modifiers\u00e2\u0080\u009d to allow mssp acos to identify whether a claim would have been denied under normal medicare ffs rules. there is no evidence to support that part a providers were or are aware of such natural disaster codes or were using them compliantly. additionally, there is no policy to use them to account for unsafe place of discharge which creates a longer length of stay. we believe that there is a current disparity between cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectation of compliance with disaster payment modifiers and the current use of such codes (see additional comments below regarding use of natural disaster codes). due to these limitations of the current policy, we instead recommend that cms revise the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy to provide a trend/growth rate that is the higher of the national assignable rate or the regional rate. further, the regional rate should be calculated by excluding the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries. studies have shown that natural disaster materially increase medicare costs per beneficiary. for example a recent article, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisaster impacts on cost and utilization of medicare\u00e2\u0080\u009d shows annual standardized cost per beneficiary increased\n7.6% from the mean in the counties most severely impacted by these events (see table 1).  \n\n quality performance scores natural disasters can have a significant negative impact on both aco process and outcomes measure scores. as an example, for process measures it is not uncommon during a disaster for scheduled annual wellness visits to be canceled due either to clinic closure or beneficiary evacuation. in some instances, these visits aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t subsequently rescheduled which leads to missed opportunities to provide preventative care and identify emerging issues that require care coordination. the current cms policy awards an average quality score to those affected by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, which can unfairly penalize high performing acos. instead we recommend cms should use an approach similar to the policy currently used in the ma program and award a quality score that is the greater of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality score for the affected performance year, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prior year quality score, or the national mean quality score. for acos that are in their first year, cms should award a quality score that is the greater of their actual quality score for the affected performance year or the national mean quality score. we also strongly recommend cms expand its policy related to aco quality scores negatively affected by a natural disaster to include all acos, not just those who cannot report quality data. we believe that acos whose scores on either the all-cause readmissions measure (aco-8) or the snf readmissions measure (aco-35) fall below the 30th percentile should be eligible to have their quality score adjusted to account for the natural disaster.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc

discharge\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which is common during a natural disaster. furthermore, the timing of the claims submission during a natural disaster does not lend itself to accurate use of the modifiers. at the time of an extreme event or natural disaster, a facility is working tirelessly to address the patient surge, to transfer patients who have clinical needs that cannot be met under emergency operating conditions, and to meet a myriad of other community needs. training health system providers to use these codes is not common. given the infrequent nature of these events providers focus their scarce training resources for revenue cycle staff to remain in compliance with medicare and medicaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever-evolving billing regulations. therefore, at a time when providers are pushed beyond capacity to manage patient care during emergencies, there is no routine revenue cycle workflow to ensure the disaster modifiers are accurately assigned. only in instances where a biller knows a claim is out of compliance for payment may the workflow to add the code be triggered. therefore, we feel the definition of these modifiers must be expanded or new natural disaster payment modifiers should be created with proper education to help isolate the extreme or uncontrollable events by claim or beneficiary during a natural disaster. naacos feels this would be a more accurate approach to analyzing impacts of extreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster.\n conclusion\n acos have been instrumental in the shift to value-based care and a central part of the aco concept is to transform healthcare through meaningful clinical and operational changes to put patients first by improving their care and reducing unnecessary expenditures. the mssp remains a voluntary program, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to have the right balance of risk and reward to continue program growth and success. program changes that deter new entrants would shut off a pipeline of beginner acos that should be encouraged to embark on the journey to value, which is a long- standing bipartisan goal of the administration and congress and important aspect of the qpp. we urge the agency to consider the feedback presented from the aco community outlined in this letter. thank you for your consideration of our comments.\n sincerely,\n\n\n", "0399": "see

comments on the centers for medicare & medicaid services proposed rule that would redesign the medicare shared savings program, encouraging organizations to transition to two-sided risk models. the undersigned accountable care organizations (acos) have embraced the migration to risk and currently participate in track 3 with their current contract set to expire december 31, 2018. upon review of the proposed rule, the acos in this collaborative are concerned that the proposed administration of the 2019 performance year could lead to unintended consequences that adversely impact them. there are three major areas of concern outlined below along with suggested solutions. we believe these solutions adequately address the concerns of this collaborative and would be feasible for cms to administer. all concerns/recommendations below pertain to the administration of performance year 2019 mssp track 3/pathways to success: enhanced track, primarily the calculations as described in sections ii.a.7.b.2. and ii.a.7.b.3.\n attribution methodology and expenditure responsibility \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 concerns:\n1. the use of two distinct assignment windows and methodologies within the 2019 \n performance year could result in an aco being attributed a total number of unique beneficiaries significantly exceeding the total within either population a or population b . example:\n\n2. for beneficiaries not included in both population a and population b, the aco will be \n held responsible for managing a full year of expenditures while only eligible to share in a half year of savings. . additionally, acos will not know who may be attributed to them in population b until july 2019, but will be held responsible for expenditures for those beneficiaries from january 1, 2019.\n3. to manage and deploy resources for the two populations, an aco would have to scale up \n infrastructure and resources despite only needing those resources for performance year 2019.\n\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 recommendation:\n1. use a singular assignment window (10/1/2017-9/30/2018) and methodology (mssp \n track 3) to determine the assigned population for the entire calendar year 2019. this will remove the challenges associated with population churn and the mismatch between at- risk expenditures and potential savings.\n\n cms proposal\n\n track 3 collaborative proposal\n\n

costs to ensure affordable, high quality, and people-centered care for all.\n trinity health is one of the largest multi-institutional catholic health care delivery systems in the nation, serving diverse communities that include more than 30 million people across 22 states. we are building a people-centered health system to put the people we serve at the center of every behavior, action and decision. this brings to life our commitment to be a compassionate, transforming and healing presence in our communities.\n trinity health includes 94 hospitals as well as 109 continuing care locations that include pace, senior living facilities, and home care and hospice services. our continuing care programs provide nearly 2.5 million visits annually. committed to those who are poor and underserved, trinity health returns $1.1 billion to our communities annually in the form of charity care and other community benefit programs. we have 35 teaching hospitals with graduate medical education (gme) programs providing training for more than 2,000 residents and fellows in 184 specialty and subspecialty programs. we employ approximately 133,000 colleagues, including more than 7,800 employed physicians and clinicians, and have more than 15,000 physicians and advanced practice professionals committed to 23 clinically integrated networks (cins) that are accountable for approximately 1.5 million lives across the country through alternative payment models (apms) across all popualtions and product lines: medicaid, commerical, medicare advantage and medicare acos. trinity health participates in the next generation aco, medicare shared savings program (mssp) tracks 1, 1+ and 3, the comprehensive primary care plus (cpc+) program, and the bundle payment for care improvement (bpci) and bpci advanced programs.\n we appreciate cms' ongoing efforts to improve payment systems across the delivery system and to continue to implement policies that further support delivery of value-based care. thank you for the opportunity to respond to this proposed rule. if you have questions on our comments, please feel free to contact me at granttw@trinity-health.org or 734-343-1375.\n sincerely,\n 2\n\n trinity health shares cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goals of transforming the health care delivery system through person- centered and market-driven approaches that empower beneficiaries as consumers and increase choices and competition to drive quality, reduce costs, and improve outcomes. we work each day to create a people-centered health system focused on delivering better health, better care, and lower costs in our communities. trinity health is committed to working with cms to promote innovative model designs and testing, including total cost of care risk models. today, approximately 25 percent or $8.5 billion of our business operates through total cost of care models, and we have set a goal of having 75 percent of our billings in value-based payment models. across our system, we serve 1.5 million patients under total cost of care contracts across all segments: medicare, medicaid and commercial risk. we are aligned with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal of encouraging participation in models with upside potential and downside risk \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the recommendations we offer below are intended to support these shared goals.\n we view the movement to value-based care and payment as essential to advancing high-quality care, improving outcomes for medicare beneficiaries and reducing costs for the program. this is particularly important given the 2018 medicare trustees report, which projects that the hospital insurance (hi) trust fund will be exhausted in 2026 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 three years earlier than the last report.1 we commend cms for implementing and evolving the medicare shared savings program (mssp), which is a critical component of the movement to value-based care across the industry. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 leadership has generated excitement and valuable learnings over the past five years.the industry has responded to the changes cms has led and we believe that we are much closer to having an accountable healthcare system today as a result.\n overall, we believe the accountable care organization (aco) model, as a delivery system, has effectively decreased costs and improved quality \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when supported by adequate investments. however, many providers have not made sufficient investments because of uncertainties in the program, inadequate upside opportunity, and continued concerns about fee-for-service (ffs) utilization. the current mssp approach has not driven enough investment by enough providers to fully test the aco model. some providers are merely participating today but not fully investing. as a result, the program has not delivered optimal results for the trust fund. we view this proposed rule as a real opportunity to build on the lessons learned to date and maximize trust fund savings. in order to do this, mssp should be viewed as an alternative to medicare advantage.\n our strong commitment to population-based models and the mssp is demonstrated by our six years of participation across multiple markets. we serve more than 200,000 medicare beneficiaries across the mssp and next generation aco models. to support our transformation work and ability to assume risk, we have made significant investments in - and implemented - market-specific and systemwide infrastructure and operational changes. for instance, we recently initiated systemwide implementation of the epic platform\u00e2\u0080\u0093 the largest \"single instance\" implementation effort across a health care system to date.\n in the last three years (2015-2017), trinity health has earned $31.2 million in shared savings through the mssp; additionally we earned $7 million in shared savings through the next generation aco program in 2016. the shared savings earned helped us recoup some of our initial investments and make new ones to generate additional savings and deliver high-quality care. in the past two years, most of our physician-led clinically integrated networks (cins) have transitioned their medicare acos to downside risk models. as a result, most of our medicare acos are now in a position to assume sufficient risk to qualify for basic track level e in the proposed rule and qualify for participation in an advanced alternative payment model.\n\n 3\n\n the comments we offer are informed by our experience transitioning to models that align with the more advanced levels of risk under the proposed basic and enhanced tracks. our recommendations fall into three major categories \u00e2\u0080\u0093 increasing upside opportunity for acos, aligning medicare advantage (ma) and aco program rules, and reducing regulatory burden on participating providers. we believe the comments we offer support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goals to encourage new providers to join the program, to retain existing high-performing acos, and to foster the long- term sustainability of the program.\n\n1. increasing upside opportunity to attract new and retain existing participants \n as an organization that has medicare acos in 18 physician-led cins creating value for patients and commercial, medicaid and ma payers in 22 different communities, we have substantial experience with the changes that occur when providers come together to form an aco. we have seen how changes to the care model and delivery system improve coordination across the continuum and generate tangible improvements in patient outcomes. based on our experience, we believe that if cms wants acos to assume downside risk more quickly than under the current mssp program, there must be sufficient opportunity for shared savings to support early investments in infrastructure. the upside opportunity must be sufficient enough to account for the business risk of participating in a model that does not meet the level of transparency, predictability and simplicity of other risk models such as medicare advantage. we also know that there are significant financial costs and investment risks associated with the start-up of these models. provider capacity to assume business risk for a population varies depending on the transparency, predictability, and simplicity of the financial model under a contract or program. while most of our acos are now capable of taking on advanced clinical risk and accountability, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to reduce the shared savings opportunity in the mssp \u00e2\u0080\u0093 coupled with the structure of the underlying financial model \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is likely to result in fewer participants and a less sustainable model for those remaining. during this period when we are all still learning, there is an alternative. the pathway to success includes increasing upside potential and broadening waivers. this would make it attractive to invest without undue risk. our proposal provides a stronger case for providers to lean into risk and transition to population-based models.\n trinity health recommends that 80% upside potential be available at all levels of the basic and enhanced tracks. this is necessary to level the playing field with medicare advantage, attract new providers into the program and to ensure that participating acos make the needed investments in infrastructure and operational changes to support care transformation and the ability to assume greater levels of risk over time. this will result in larger trust fund savings. trinity health urges cms to simplify the program by making all shared saving programs 80% upside, this would include the following bold changes to the proposed shared savings levels in the basic and enhanced tracks: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 basic track: levels a and b should include a shared savings rate of 80%; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 basic track: levels c and d should include a shared savings rate of 80% balanced by an increase in shared risk levels to meet advanced apm criteria; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 basic track: level e should include a shared savings rate of 80% and maintain the proposed shared risk structure; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 enhanced track: include a shared savings rate of 80% and maintain the proposed shared risk structure; and \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 enhanced track: include a full capitation model for advanced acos.\n 4\n\n invest in the care management, cehrt, and other capabilities needed to successfully manage population health and costs.\n our proposed changes to the shared risk levels under basic track levels c and d would also qualify these models as advanced apms and better prepare acos to move into the enhanced track. this would create more opportunity for physicians to participate in advanced apms and models that encourage the delivery of value-based care. we believe these changes to basic track levels c and d would require relatively minor adjustments and would help create a better business case for the aco model, and achieve cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal of increasing the number of advanced apms available to eligible clinicians.\n trinity health supports the option for all acos to choose levels of risk in the basic track upon enrollment. rather than make shared savings-only models less appealing, we urge cms to focus its efforts on making models with downside financial risk more attractive while continuing to support shared savings-only models. contracts without downside risk can result in net savings for medicare as acos gain experience. a 2016 study examined aco results between 2012-2014 and found that net savings were accruing to medicare by 2014.2 our own experience, and now research, also support that to optimize results for medicare, acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 regardless of revenue level - should have the option to remain in basic track level a for at least three years. a recent study by naacos found that between 2013 and 2015, mssp acos achieved net savings of $542 million, but found that it takes time for quality improvement and cost reduction to occur and performance improved with time.3  under this proposal, providers are already at risk because they have only three years to position for downside risk or lose those investments and the network they have built around them when cms terminates their contract. this creates potent leverage for cms. in the most recent results on the 2017 performance year, upside only acos generated more savings per beneficiary than those bearing risk under mssp tracks 2 and 3. there is real opportunity to build on the lessons to-date and achieve larger trust fund savings.\n agreement period trinity health supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to move from three to five year contract agreement periods. we believe that longer contract agreements increase predictability and stability for providers and health systems that are making investments and other system changes to support participation. we also support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to align the contract length with other innovation center models.\n termination from program trinity health supports efforts to encourage continual quality improvement among acos. however, it is important to balance encouraging provider participation in the program with incentives to become high-performers. given that it often takes several years of participating in a model to see savings, we recommend that providers have three years to demonstrate the ability to generate savings. if at the end of that time, savings cannot be generated, cms could then terminate contracts with those participants.\n however, we ask that cms allow acos that include cpc+ to remain in upside-only tracks until cpc+ care management fees can be fully incorporated into the benchmark in order to prevent premature termination from the program for those acos simply due to program overlap. the cpc+ program fills a critical gap in advanced primary care payment models. while the cpc+ care management fees are accounted for as aco expenditures, they are not included in the historical cost base for an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark, which harms those entities that both participate as an\n 2 mcwilliams, j. michael, changes in medicare shared savings program savings from 2013 to 2014, jama, research letter, october 25, 2016. 3 mechanic,  robert, gaus, clifton, medicare shared savings program produces substantial savings: new policies should promote aco growth, health affairs, september 11, 2018.\n 5\n\n aco and are also transforming primary care practices. in any market where the vast majority of primary care providers are in cpc+, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal will negatively impact acos. we have seen this in two of our own markets, where the cpc+ expenditures create an additional hurdle to meeting an already high msr.\n aco participation options based on high/low-revenue and prior participation we ask that cms allow high-revenue acos to remain in level e of the basic track for a second agreement period. high-revenue acos, by nature of their size and inclusion of providers across the continuum of care, are likely to have greater responsibility for care coordination across inpatient and outpatient settings than low-revenue acos. however, high-revenue acos are also better positioned to drive more appropriate care utilization across the continuum and decrease unnecessary hospital events over time. allowing high-revenue aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to remain in level e for a second agreement period would help ensure these large entities can successfully move to greater levels of risk that require systemwide investments and operational and infrastructure changes.\n as proposed, the increase in risk from level e to the enhanced track is significant. as a result, we ask that cms allow high-revenue aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to remain in level e for a second agreement period to ensure these large entities have the time needed to successfully manage the move to greater business and clinical risk. restricting the ability to remain in basic track level e for a second agreement period for high-revenue acos could lead to significant attrition of current track 1 participants.\n given that high-revenue acos are responsible for a greater share of healthcare spending than low- revenue acos, it is reasonable to ask them to assume greater levels of risk and/or at a faster pace than low-revenue acos. however, cms should also take into account that larger systems must invest in change across a much broader delivery \"footprint\" and so may require additional investments over multiple years to make transformative system changes. when making these higher investments, these acos are taking on much greater business risk and so need a longer time to recoup investments.\n high-revenue acos can include hospitals, physician groups, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies. depending on their starting point, they may require different amounts of time to successfully transform. increasing the amount of risk assumed can support alignment of incentives for the delivery of person-centered care and savings for the system; however, it also requires additional time and investment to implement changes across the care continuum. for hospitals and health systems, necessary changes are far reaching, including changes to discharge processes, transitions to nursing home care, and delivery of home-based care. additionally, care delivery transformation entails investing in cehrt across the system. for example, this year trinity health committed to implementing the largest single instance of epic in the country, an integrated platform for population health, ehr and revenue cycle systems. the goal is to enable a better care experience for the people we serve across all our markets, providing a single, comprehensive health record with seamless access to clinical and billing information. epic also aims to improve the experience for our physicians and clinicians through integrated information to improve patient care and support seamless handoffs.\n 6\n\n to move to a risk-based model. in addition, for those who have chosen a zero or low msr, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside the corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d creates a double-edged sword where they are penalized for taking on more downside risk. our own experience suggests this is not sufficient and will not allow acos the opportunity to make strategic decisions regarding performance improvement which allow them to demonstrate success in future program years. as noted above, we have participated in mssp for six years and most of our acos are now in risk-bearing tracks and generating savings\u00e2\u0080\u0094demonstrating savings can be achieved, but can take a longer investment horizon.\n qualifying as an advanced apm trinity health believes apms are key to driving system transformation that improves quality and care for beneficiaries and reduces health care costs. as noted in our comments on the basic and enhanced tracks, we recommend that cms make changes to basic tracks c and d to allow them to qualify as advanced apms. in addition, many of our other recommendations, including increasing upside opportunity for basic and enhanced track acos, and allowing high- revenue acos to remain in level e for a second agreement period, will also ensure that acos remain in the program and that more join \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thereby increasing participation options in advanced apms.\n\n2. creating a level playing field between mssp acos and medicare advantage \n we believe it is critical for cms to align participation rules across the aco and medicare advantage (ma) programs to ensure a level playing field for all providers, access to care for all beneficiaries, and lower costs for the medicare program. we applaud cms for moving toward similar waiver opportunities and beneficiary assignment methodology. we offer a number of additional suggestions to align rules across the two including: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 aligning hcc risk adjustment methodologies between the mssp and ma; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 broadening flexibility within mssp on alternate sites of care where that care can be delivered safely but is currently not allowed (e.g., infusion, hospital at home). \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 aligning care management flexibilities including determinations as to level and site of care; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 testing value-based insurance design (vbid) features in acos as they assume greater levels of risk; and, \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 maintaining the current 70% regional adjustment in the benchmark and moving to a completely regional benchmark, which is more aligned with ma regional benchmarking.\n trinity health believes that alignment of rules between ma and acos will further allow acos to lean into risk by assuming full accountability over time. trinity health strongly advises aligning hcc risk adjustment methodologies across both aco and ma models. leveling the risk playing field between ma and acos would make the aco model more attractive to organizations willing to take on greater financial risk and therefore drive greater investment in care transformation. otherwise, the trend of organizations shifting investments solely to ma will continue. this migration from traditional medicare to ma creates a perverse outcome, driving up costs for the medicare trust fund. equalizing the hcc coding rules for ma and acos will curb provider movement toward ma only. additionally, this will curb further depletion of the trust fund, reining in overall medicare spend and slowing this transfer of wealth from taxpayers to investors.\n choice of beneficiary assignment methodology trinity health supports the ability of acos to choose either prospective or retrospective assignment. the ability to choose prospective assignment supports an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to manage care as they assume greater levels of risk. however, we support giving acos the choice as to whether they use prospective or retrospective alignment. this should be a clinical and business decision made by each aco.\n\n\n\n\n 7\n\n beneficiary \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d trinity health supports affirmative recognition of the relationship between a beneficiary and an aco, as this can support patient engagement and care management. however, this must be implemented in a way that reduces administrative burden. to this end, cms should explore ways to implement beneficiary opt-in in more simplified ways than early efforts through the next generation and pioneer aco programs. for example, the existing process requires managing and tracking mailings, which require financial and human resources without a substantial impact on enrollment. we ask that cms ensure that implementation of a beneficiary opt-in option not also introduce new administrative costs to acos, drawing down of funding that would otherwise support care delivery. finally, we believe beneficiary opt-in is an opportunity to align aco and ma rules. however, beneficiaries will need basic education on their choices (e.g. ma, acos, and traditional fee-for- service) from cms so they can make informed decisions about how and where to receive their care.\n waivers trinity health supports the proposed expansion of the telehealth and snf 3-day waivers, and allowing acos to provide beneficiary incentives. we also recommend that cms reduce the reporting burden related to these waivers by relying on existing claims or other available data. similarly, we recommend that cms acknowledge the investment waivers require and include when rebasing benchmarks.\n for acos to lean into greater levels or risk, additional waivers are needed that facilitate the delivery of the right care at the right time. we urge cms to make all waivers available to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0094as this will support flexibility needed to deliver high-quality, appropriate care\u00e2\u0080\u0094and build in appropriate monitoring to identify potential abuse.\n through existing waivers, aco participants have been able to better meet the needs of patients in innovative ways. however, there is uncertainty regarding the availability of particular waivers as a result of limited guidance from cms on the intended scope of, or applicability to, certain aco participants. the uncertainty has resulted in acos not choosing to opt-in to an available waiver due to concerns over noncompliance during implementation. if the expanded waivers are finalized, we urge cms to expedite regular updates to frequently asked questions (faqs) and other guidance and/or commentaries in response to aco questions. we also ask that cms and the office of the inspector general provide options for acos to request guidance regarding the applicability and implementation of waivers without having to ask for a traditional advisory opinion.\n beneficiary incentives we believe that as providers assume greater levels of risk, they should have more levers available to manage and engage patients in their care. as a result, trinity health generally supports greater flexibility to provide beneficiary incentives that facilitate greater engagement with - and care management from - a regular set of providers. however, we would encourage cms to ensure that beneficiary incentives, as described in the proposed rule, do not create an unlevel playing field among small and large acos.\n in addition to the cash-equivalent incentives described in the proposed rule, cms should consider health-related incentives such as co-pay waivers for primary care services and preventive services received within the aco such as immunizations, the medicare diabetes prevention program (mdpp), and screenings (e.g. cancer, diabetes).\n 8\n\n share learnings with newer participants and help guide future model evolution. sustainability of the program is also an important consideration \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we believe that entities should be rewarded that are historically efficient and high-performers in their market. last, retaining the current regional adjustment in the benchmark would also align the aco program with ma given the regional nature of the benchmarking and bid process in that program.\n benchmarking - risk adjustment trinity health supports the addition of a symmetrical cap on risk scores given that the health profile of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patient population is likely to change over time. the +/- 3 percent cap for the mssp aco program is also more consistent with the next generation aco program, moving closer to continuity in methodology across tracks and programs. however, extending the cap to five years will penalize acos that treat high-risk patients or that retain patients whose burden of illness increases over time.\n\n3. reducing regulatory burden \n trinity health supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal to reduce regulatory burden \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and appreciates recent initiatives, such as patients over paperwork. we also applaud the implementation of changes to the mssp program authorized by congress in the bipartisan budget act of 2018 that reduce regulatory barriers to providing person-centered care, such as expanding the use of telehealth, promoting beneficiary choice, and incenting the use of necessary primary care services.\n cms can further reduce regulatory burdens by providing greater flexibility or waivers to support the delivery of patient-centered care and services in the home. often, patients can be safely treated in the home for conditions that would meet hospital level criteria, and yet a drg can only be paid if that care is delivered in an inpatient facility. cms should remove site of service barriers to enable the administration of drugs based on clinical appropriateness, patient preference and need, rather than place of service  (e.g. permitting aco providers to perform home infusions or other supportive care when clinically safe and appropriate. trinity health also supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to create new collaborations between acos and standalone prescription drug plans (pdps) and to examine how part d drugs could be included in the mssp to further manage the total cost of care. these actions would also further align the program with medicare advantage.\n there is also an opportunity to minimize administrative burden and costs related to the mandatory first, face-to-face visit, beneficiary notification provision. cms can offer flexibility to acos in implementing this requirement, which would both reduce administrative costs and facilitate effective communication with beneficiaries. for instance, cms could allow practices to make a poster prominently available containing the necessary information versus a hard-copy at each patient visits; permit a degree of freedom in how this is recorded and documented from a compliance standpoint; and, provide flexibility in timing of the notification such as tying it to any visit throughout the year versus the first visit of the year.\n last, we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to require one group practice reporting option (gpro) reporting period for 2019 and to acknowledge the aco participant list as of july 1, 2019 to determine the gpro quality reporting samples as this will reduce administrative burden for participating providers.\n minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss ratio (mlr) trinity health supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow acos to decide incremental msr based on the individual aco's risk tolerance. these options are important for individual acos to assume the level of business risk they are capable of and willing to take, based on their own business decisions.\n 9\n\n industry and cms must work together to rapidly adopt existing consensus-driven core measure sets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as cms has set out to do through the meaningful measures initiative - while working to identify the next generation of core measures. there should also be an emphasis on advancing and adopting patient-reported outcomes measures (proms), which are critical for creating a people-centered health system.\n we also support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed addition of opioid use measures. these efforts will support and align with our systemwide opioid use reduction (our) initiative. trinity health is committed to partnering with all stakeholders to address opioid use through prevention, intervention, treatment and recovery initiatives. a comprehensive approach to the opioid epidemic is imperative to reducing opioid harm and promoting people-centered care.\n last, while statutory changes are necessary, we reiterate the importance of aligning 42 cfr part 2 (part 2) confidentiality requirements for sharing a patient's substance use disorder records with the requirements in the health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa). unlike hipaa, part 2 does not allow for sharing or re-disclosure of identifiable substance use disorder information for treatment, payment or health care operations (\"tpo\") purposes without patient consent. moreover, part 2 requires regulated programs to provide a notice to recipients of identifiable substance use disorder information noting that the information cannot be re-disclosed. from a compliance perspective, the different standards between hipaa and part 2 have made it extremely difficult for our hospitals and health systems to know when and how this information may be shared, including within individual hospitals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 despite the importance of care coordination for individuals with substance use disorders.\n cehrt/promoting interoperability trinity health supports alignment across all medicare programs including the quality payment program (qpp) and the aco programs. however, we ask that cms make gradual increases in cehrt usage requirements in both the qpp and aco programs from 50 to 75% for advanced apm status. this is especially critical for small practices and acos with limited resources to invest in cehrt.\n overlap of other advanced apms trinity health has long been concerned about the launch of new models that overlap with existing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and population-based models- such as acos. cms must consider the overlap of the cpc+ and aco programs in particular. as previously noted, we recommend that cms allow acos that include cpc+ participants to remain in upside only tracks until cpc+ care management fees can be fully incorporated into the benchmark to prevent premature termination from the program.\n social determinants of health trinity health is committed to advancing the health of individuals and populations. we strongly believe that payment and delivery models should support addressing the social determinants of health, which research has shown drive health outcomes and costs. as cms seeks to improve the aco program, we believe this is an area where the agency can continue to work with state, regional and local stakeholders to find ways to integrate social services into care management programs. in addition, cms should examine ways to adjust payment in apms based upon sociodemographic factors to support holistic care of patients.\n 10\n\n\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 final reconciliation in years with these circumstances should not only mitigate shared losses, but provide parity for the msr and mlr for acos who just missed their msr or exceeded their mlr because of the natural disaster and associated the in part a costs; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 quality measure reporting exceptions and changes should be available to all acos impacted by a natural disaster, not just those who cannot report quality data and all acos should receive the higher of the 2018 or the 2019 star rating for each cahps measure; and, \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 adjusting for natural disaster related impacts at the beneficiary and claims level by expanding the use of the natural disaster payment modifier codes to capture unsafe places of discharge and allowing for an additional 6-12 months to correct and resubmit claims to allow for inclusion of natural disaster modifiers.\n\n", "0428": "see

medicare  shared  savings  program;  accountable  care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success to whom it may concern:\n the rural policy research institute health panel (panel) was established in 1993 to provide science-based, objective policy analysis to federal policy makers. the panel is pleased to offer comments in response to this particular  proposed  rule. our comments are  limited to  rural-specific  issues and  are  structured  to  parallel questions posed, or issues stated, by cms (not technical comments regarding specific sections of the proposed rule).\n overall,  the  panel supports  efforts to improve the medicare shared  savings program,  and  other  issues highlighted in this proposed rule. medicare represents a higher proportion of patients for most rural health care organizations and clinicians than in urban areas, so medicare policies may have a disproportionate impact on rural providers, hospitals, and beneficiaries. therefore, we hope our comments below serve as valuable input during the proposed rule finalization.\n the panel supports the recommendation described on page 41863, to extend the 3-day rule waver to services provided by a hospital or cah under the swing bed arrangement. doing so will facilitate better serving the needs of rural beneficiaries by providing covered services in their communities because the local provider is a cah (in the absence of a skilled nursing facility).\n 2 participation is likely to discourage participation by rural providers operating on very thin margins (e.g., critical access hospitals and rural physician alliances). we recommend cms consider a third-year at no downside risk for a defined group of providers (some characteristics or types \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maybe cah, fqhc, low revenue acos), in effect two years in level b prior to moving to c, d, and e in the basic track. we also recommend considering lowering the minimum savings ratio for those acos, and considering a downward adjustment to the maximum level of downside risk as a percent of the aco participant revenue and/or benchmark. these changes retain the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objective of accountability for total cost, but at a risk level more suitable for low revenue rural acos.\n recognizing  the  challenges  of  applying  the  aco  model  to  multiple  circumstances  (provider  types,  size  of healthcare organizations, number of beneficiaries in the market, capitalization of healthcare organizations), the  panel suggests creating  new demonstration projects to  achieve  objectives  of  lowering  costs  while achieving high quality. those demonstrations could include: (1) innovative payment models for rural providers\n(e.g., global budgeting); and (2) innovative delivery system reform models that bring clinical and non-clinical \n together in one organization model, with companion payment redesign.\n the panel commends cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued work on these critical issues and we thank you for the opportunity to submit comments prior to the finalization of this proposed rule.\n\n sincerely,\n the rural policy research institute health panel\n keith j. mueller, phd \u00e2\u0080\u0093 chair andrew f. coburn, phd jennifer p. lundblad, phd, mba\n a. clinton mackinney, md, ms \n timothy d. mcbride, phd charlie alfero\n\n\n\n\n", "0437": "centers for medicare and medicaid services\r\ndepartment of health and human services\r\nattn: cms-1701-p\r\np.o. box 8013\r\nbaltimore, md 21244-8013\r\n\r\none of my biggest concerns comes from not being able to fund the required payment mechanism. we are already in a situation where our budget dollars have been stretched past the elasticity point of return. we are frontier/rural medicine and in order to make this work for all of us, there needs to be a greater level of participation. the addition of a one-sided \"rural track\" is more than necessary, it is a must if the goal is to achieve a value-based care model. i think we all want to embrace a population health care model, but it must be affordable and attractive enough to do so.\r\n\r\nmr. kelly pottorff\r\nadministrator\r\ncheyenne county hospital\r\n210 w. first street\r\nst. francis kansas 67756     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     ", "0438": "baptist physician partners does not feel that 2 years is sufficient time in an upside-only model prior to moving to downside risk. we suggest at least 3 years in an upside only model for new acos entering the mssp.\r\n\r\nhigh performers should be encouraged to participate in models regardless of provider type. we request that cms eliminate the distinction of high- and low-revenue acos and instead give equal footing to all model participants\r\n\r\ncms must ensure a business case for taking on risk. therefore we disagree with the reduction of shared savings to 25%.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     ", "0467": "see attached file(s)october 15, 2018\nms. seema verma\nadministrator\ncenters for medicare & medicaid services\nhubert h. humphrey building\n200 independence avenue, s.w., room 445-g\nwashington, dc 20201\n\nre: \u00e2\u00a0cms-2018-0101-0001 medicare program: medicare shared savings program;
