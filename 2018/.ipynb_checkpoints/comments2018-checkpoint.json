{"0002": "under the current standards for medicare shared savings program (mssp) upside-only models, organizations are not forced to make a commitment to a new business model centered on value and outcomes, rather than on volume and market power. the length of time allowed in a one-sided risk model has historically proven to show no benefits to reduction of costs. this new process outlined in the \"pathways to success\" has great potential to change the landscape of accountable care organizations (aco) and cost reduction. however, by constantly lowering the benchmark for those that meet them can inevitably create a benchmark that is quite virtually unattainable. the health of individuals, especially older individuals that utilize healthcare resources is dynamic; in that it is constantly changing. these individuals may require more resources at certain times, virtually diminishing the cost savings an organization can see. perhaps a change in thinking with regards to the percentage of change for benchmarks based on savings should be reconsidered. this could make the two-sided risk models more enticing and feasible to organizations. a greater technical and policy alignment of the aco program with medicare advantage could encourage enrollment and benefit providers and patients alike, by adding predictability and reducing complexity. according to mostashari and broome (2018) the processes for establishing these rates are well understood, and the rates themselves are much more predictable. the rates are set prospectively, and do not require extensive analysis of cost trends months after the conclusion of the performance years.\r\n\r\nreference\r\nmostashari, f. & broome, t.

to the point. i, as a provider and administrator of a health system, have had a chance to review the proposed rule and feel it it my duty to respond with constructive comments.\r\n\r\ni feel the cms philosophy on accountable care organization and pathway to risk is fundamentally flawed. the uncertainty of targets, statistical chances or variation and volume based rewards continue in this pathway. i would like to strongly urge you all to consider overhauling the entire program. your proposal does nothing but extends the program for another five years. meanwhile you will continue to pay out large sums of monies based on random variations, wrongful rewards, and statistical \"winners.\"\r\n\r\nhere are the suggestions i have from a provider and management perspective who has dealt with moving a financially troubled organization towards value based care:\r\n\r\n1. your benchmark target setting strategy is unnecessarily complex, allows for propagation of \"bad\" utilization behavior, and rewards for minor adjustments. if you are truly looking to bend the cost curve, then regressing to mean national benchmark is absolutely important. elimination of regional variation is critical. rewarding the 50% of aco's that fall below the national pbpy spend is sending the message that cost of care is critical to success in aco. higher cost aco's do not contribute to reduced cost, and should face a penalty. so, set a national base benchmark that would be risk adjusted based on regional variations of risk score and only risk score. this creates absolute transparency in the benchmarks and goals.\r\n\r\n2. pay back penalties are ridiculous and will cause a many aco's to drop out of the program. it is interesting that you have not set up a pay back system for the physicians and providers. under mips the providers face a penalty, but for aco structure you have imposed a pay back strategy. i would recommend you consider a pathway for penalty. instead of pay back, aco's whose spend is greater than the set target will achieve a negative adjustment proportional to the percentage overspent from the benchmark for both part a and part b payments. to ease the burden, you could lift and divide the effect by half to make it equal to shared savings. you will likely get more aco's taking risk on this pathway than the current proposed payback methodology.\r\n\r\n3. the proposed rules continue to make misalignment between physician payments and aco's financial responsibilities. on one hand, you expect the aco's to bring physicians together and improve cost and quality of care. on the other hand, you set up different financial consequences for aco's and providers. the aco takes financial risk, but the providers are all rewarded with 5% bonus. this is the same effect of enforcing drg based payment to the hospitals, but physician reimbursement continues at ffs. you will get no traction in improving health care delivery by creating such antagonism, which i am sure you have learned from the hospital payment system program. i would recommend you consider the opportunity to reward physicians only if their aco is able to beat the benchmark. the aapm adjustment would only apply if the aco generated shared savings or demonstrated financial responsibility.\r\n\r\n4. the retrospective quality payment is ineffective as a strategy. it will never lead to quality improvement since the timelines do not match with realistic and practical patient outcomes. since medicine changes so rapidly, cms needs to embrace advancement in quality outcomes more than process based measures. the undue burden of reporting and administrative tasks is only creating provider burnout, not improving quality. to be effective, i would recommend stream lining quality efforts to 10 specific outcome measures that lead to social and public health impact. having direct financial incentive for each one and not tied with other financial outcomes allows organizations and physicians to drive, fund, and sustain continued quality efforts. you can financially justify additional payments with the move towards national benchmark target.\r\n\r\n5. finally, the concept of risk should include advancement to complete risk, not just shared risk. i would recommend that if an aco with sufficient volume is able to demonstrate good quality and low cost for three consecutive years, then they should be advanced for a more comprehensive capitated partnership. allow them to take on complete risk with capitated payments and complete scope of services for the care of the patient. this will lift burden from cms. cms can continue to provide oversight, monitor claims activity and adjust capitation rates based on services provided and overall quality of care delivered.\r\n\r\nplease do not hesitate to reach out if i can help in elaborating any concepts.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n

the year? how would they meet their percentage thresholds to become qp especially when these thresholds may be proposed to change next year?\r\n\r\n2. for current track 1+ aco's who have taken on initial risk, cms will not have performance data available for them until september 2019. how can they make the decision to advance to enhanced track without knowing their performance final results? i feel the same issue and concern will be faced by all performance-experienced aco's currently as they will not have any feedback on their performance until after the start of the new model.\r\n\r\nfor

successcms-1701-p\r\n\r\nas president of the hackensack alliance aco, a track 1 mssp participant from the onset of the program, i would like to share my views on the direction cms is taking as well as the proposed new rules. it is my understanding that the goal of the mssp program was to bend the cost curve and introduce the concept of the triple aim (which became the quadruple aim). a secondary benefit was to develop provider understanding of value based care models. it was clear to many of us that the major components of cost were related to inpatient hospitalizations, and also subacute care programs. interestingly, the historic development of these cost centers stems from governmental regulation creating payment methods for the care. if you pay someone to provide a service, then the service will be provided. if you pay someone for a certain outcome, then effort will be made to ensure that outcome.\r\nthe mssp program made no effort to curb the payments to these two major cost centers, and focused on physician behavior to drive success. once again, success was not identified as outcome improvement, but only cost cutting and documentation of process (quality outcomes). the reason acos with strong hospital ties were not as successful as expected is because the hospitals had no reason to change their operating behaviors. in fact, many hospitals were willing to accept readmission penalties, because the payment was in excess of the penalty. therefore, the mssp program rules did not correspond to effectuate the stated goals of the program.\r\nat the same time, other programs were being offered which diluted the ability of acos to succeed. these include medicare advantage and cpc+. the opportunities to realize profit from ma programs encourages hospitals and networks to develop programs specifically for those patients. their leakage is controlled by benefit plan, and the benchmarks are predetermined. in addition, the benchmarks are uniformly higher than mssp. the cpc+ program provides dollars to practices in order to improve care management services. if these services were available in mssp, the results would have been much different. if a physician is participating in mssp and cpc+, then the dollars for care management are added to the cost of care in mssp. this encourages acos to exclude doctors in cpc+, probably their most advanced providers.\r\nthe new proposal will decrease the shared savings percentage during the non-risk years. this will lessen the interest in the program. most physician-only acos are fearful of assuming risk because of the inability to control the two largest cost centers, as well as no control over leakage. the hospital supported acos will recognize that the more hospitalizations that occur, the higher risk of losses, and therefore not support mssp.\r\nthe point is that it appears that the new proposal intends to allow mssp to die a slow death, and blame the acos for not participating. i urge cms to reevaluate the program by looking at the intended goals, and then building a program which supports attaining those goals. perhaps the goal should be medicare advantage and cpc+ only. perhaps the goal should be to change the medicare benefit plan. perhaps there should be more incentive for medicare recipients to join ma. if the goal is to maintain current medicare enrollment, then the rules must be changed to direct patients away from the two highest cost centers- not just by changing provider behavior, but by changing behavior of hospitals and subacute care centers. as long as these cost centers benefit by volume, the cost curve is safe from bending.\r\n\r\nmorey menacker     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     ", "0006":

will never be 100% accurate under any assignment algorithm. that said, without any hesitation, i can say with full confidence that the best way to assign beneficiaries is by listed pcp. providers must ask patients to declare who their pcp is and this must be a primary care physician, primary care pa or np, or an internal medicine physician. there should be no other type of practitioner that counts for aco assignment. for example, a cardiologist or a pa that works for an orthopedist can not by definition and should not count as a pcp. you can't simply change the definition of primary care for the sake of a program. it will destroy the medical home model of care leading to uncoordinated care, increase costs, and poor quality care. specialists and their midlevels simply do not have the skills to coordinate the functions of a true primary care practitioner. allowing beneficiaries to select a specialist or a specialist's midlevel as a pcp through voluntary alignment is bad policy.\r\n\r\n2. there needs to be a path for pcmh level 3 federally qualified health centers to become an advanced payment model without having to join an aco. fqhcs already understand how to reduce costs and deliver high value quality care because of their experience with the uniform data system (uds) quality measures and processes. by additionally having to join an aco to participate in the mssp, it puts fqhcs at an unfair advantage because of the additional time, effort and resources required to track and participate in two high value quality programs while other types of clinics only have to participate in one high value quality program. this results in increased cost to fqhcs and added strain on staff. i recommend that their be a certification process for pcmh level 3 fqhcs that allows them to qualify as an apm. if they achieve certification, then they should be able to simply report the medicare quality data that is already contained within their uds reports. this would alleviate all of the extra requirements that come with joining an aco, which causes fqhc staff to be stretched too thin and results in a high level of stress. when joining our aledade aco, it was clear that we already knew how to to deliver high value quality care, while the other non-fqhc members were having to learn how to deliver this kind of care for the first time. i think it makes sense to require other clinic types that don't have the experience that fqhcs have join acos. however, it doesn't make much sense to require an fqhc to join an aco to access the mssp when they already know how to deliver high value quality care. thank you.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     ", "0008": "comments on 42 cfr parts 414 and 425\r\n\r\n[cms-1701-p]\r\n\r\nrin 0938-at45\r\nmedicare program;

cms-1701-p 42 cfr parts 414 and 425\n it is clear that cms, omb, and the other constituencies within the administration have worked tirelessly to improve the medicare shared saving program and to protect the medicare trust fund while balancing the needs and wants of both the taxpayer and beneficiary.  we applaud your efforts.\n before we make any specific recommendation, we would like to point out an area of general concern.  in the push to greater risk, a number of acos will undoubtedly drop from the program which may result in beneficiaries treated by those providers to lose the underlying quality improvement programs and initiatives.  further, as the shared savings program narrows it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus and assignment rules we are concerned that some of the most fragile and poorly coordinated populations are losing quality improvement programs.  this is specifically concerning for beneficiaries in skilled nursing facilities.  with cms excluding snf patients from assignment, this population that could so significantly benefit from coordination are left out of the movement toward value vs. volume.\n the expansion of the three year contract cycle to five years is of great concern.  the 2012/2013 starts have been either sheltered from consequences or put at a significant competitive disadvantage.  as noted in the nprm, several acos received windfall profits, our review of the 2012/2013 starts (all of them) suggests that some of the most efficient provider groups partnered with cms as early adopters, only to be put at a competitive disadvantage when the regional benchmarking formulas where deployed to later entrants.  further, it is not likely that the regulatory landscape will remain consistent over the next five years.  history demonstrated that the program is still maturing and significant advancement in regulation continue to be likely. shelter from consequence or competitively disadvantaging superior performers is not in the best interest of cms, beneficiaries or the tax payers.  we suggest that cms either shorten the contract cycles or provider for immediate  update for regulations (all ma provider contracts allow for such) on the annual anniversary of the contract effective date.\n our specific suggestions focus on making quality performance the mission critical determinant of success, followed closely behind by economic efficiency.  in general, those acos that demonstrate both high quality and lower costs than their regional rivals should be allowed to bring their better product result to the market in a more forceful and deliberate fashion.  we have modeled out the full cost, variable cost and net economic impacts of both the current and proposed regulations and find they net-net to be muted significantly in facility based acos because of the variable vs full cost elements of excess utilization.  gain and loss sharing rates alone will be insufficient to drive transformation of the health system to assure liquidity of the medicare trust fund.  allowing the market forces of a better product to guide beneficiaries in their care decisions will have greater impact on the net-net economics of the large systems and maximize the liquidity of the medicare trust fund.\n there are several areas which would benefit from greater effort, clarity and precision than that described in the nprm:  these are:\n\n1. substantively increase beneficiary alignment with high quality low cost acos  \n\n2. unify quality measures between medicare shared savings programs (the shared savings \n program) and medicare advantage (ma).\n3. use tools and techniques successful in ma to further enable the shared savings program. \n\n4. expansion of aipbp type programs to the shared savings program. \n\n5. vehicle for medical necessity determination and claim appeal for the shared savings \n program.\n encourage beneficiaries to align with high quality and low cost acos: cms should link the constraints of risk adjusted regional benchmarking to the quality score which will reinforce the imperative of high quality and lower cost care.   further, we suggest that a significant portion of this value be provided directly to the beneficiary.  our analysis indicates that for the highest performing acos (table below) an amount equal to 30% of regional benchmark adjustment value (after applying the regional/historic weighting factor) would provide the beneficiary a noticeable and tangible benefit that would result in greater alignment with the very best acos.  this incentive could be in the form of either reduced copays/coinsurance or a rebate on part b premiums will directly reinforce the goal of moving our health care system to high quality and low cost.\n in the table below is the example of expanding reginal to historic benchmark value that should be shared with beneficiaries for the highest quality and lower cost acos.  by including the beneficiary in the value generated by very high quality acos which demonstrate lower costs, significant market forces are brought to bear for the benefit of the trust fund and the beneficiary.  cms could utilize several options to administrate this element.  most easily administered is the reduced cost shares as they could be applied at the time of service when the beneficiary utilizes a provider in the aco.  either by the aco provider which is allowed to waive certain cost shares, or in the adjudication and pricing of a claim.  similar to the aipbp process providers would contract with these acos as either preferred providers/suppliers or actual aco participants.    the aco would choose to the waiving of cost share or having the increased amount paid (in the calculation of cost share in a claims process) from the shared savings payment.  we believe most acos would utilize the waived cost share by the provider option vs. increasing the amount paid by cms.  this would further encourage the beneficiaries to use aco contracted providers.\n slightly more problematic in administration, is the rebate of some portion of the part b premium. significantly enabled by prospective voluntary alignment, it would be reasonable for cms to require voluntary prospective alignment in order for the beneficiary to access the part b premium rebate.\n underlying quality score vs. report only value) of a new the shared savings program contract or upon renewal of existing aco entity.  these values would be updated annually to reinforce continued process improvement.\n in the table below, the trust fund retains no less than 60% of the value of low cost providers, and the beneficiaries may gain 12% (highest weighting x 30%).  the efficient health care system would then have a gross savings opportunity of 28%  of the differential prior to the application of the sharing percent with cms.  to further incent acos to take risk, this factor would only be available to level e or enhanced acos.  fully realized the trust fund retains 60% initially, then either an additional 7% (enhanced) or 14% (level e) of the regional vs. historic variation. this formula limits any windfall profits, provide more incentive for successful acos to move to risk and beneficiary to align with the high quality, lowest cost provider systems, as well as, blunt the incentive of the lowest cost acos to move to medicare advantage.  lastly, the market force implied within this structure should cause all providers in the geography to improve quality and lower costs.\n suggested quality score, constraint, and weighting quality score limit

likely that an aco with quality scores below 86% that was significantly above regional average would stay in the shared savings program.  further, the providers within the poor performing aco would see their relative cost to beneficiaries increase significantly, they are after all in a less valuable system of care.\n\n\n\n\n unifying quality measures between shared savings program and ma: there should be fewer measures which are published on a roadmap for implementation for both programs.  through the use of market forces in both programs, success on each measure would be all but assured.  the differing standards of compliance and different measures serves only to confuse the physicians and their staff, as well as, spread scant resources yet thinner across a broader water front of activities.  with a roadmap of measures and performance, organizations would focus their energies in achieving these metrics is systematic and deliberate fashion.  as measures are added, older measures should be phased out with larger thresholds, yet more significant penalties for a lack of performances.\n for example, if the super majority of contractors have achieved a 95%+ score the upside value of the measure would be retired while the downside would be retained for some period to entrench the process as a standard.  the penalty for sub 90% score could be a decrement of 5% of either net payment level in ma or benchmark in the shared savings program.  poor performers would suffer a significant consequence, while superior performers monitor maintenance and move incremental resources to emerging measures.  this decrement would be in addition to any regional benchmarking decrement outlined above.\n\n tools from medicare advantage (ma) to enable shared savings program. the shared savings program has created a pandora\u00e2\u0080\u0099s box issue related to the physician community.  historically, very few physicians had direct empirical evidence of their relative or absolute cost and quality.  now, most physicians in an aco know their panel cost, their quality score and the averages of the aco now know their absolute and relative economic performance. the high performing physicians are now decidedly motivated to balance their efforts in favor of\nma.  unfortunately, this would not really expand savings to the trust fund and would serve \n only to reduce options and choices for the beneficiaries.  the better solution for all constituencies is that mssp more closely resemble ma, more organization seeking higher savings.\n the improvement in the shared savings program rule comes in at least two areas.  first it he application of risk adjustment to benchmarking.  we have seen the implementation of icd10 increase the specificity diagnostic precision and hence risk score \u00e2\u0080\u0093 coding intensity and both ma and shared savings programs have made initial adjustments.  we should note that using coding intensity for the sole purposes of revenue enhancement borders on abuse as it relates to fwa regulations.  in the era of accountability, accurately and completely describing the diagnostic and health status of the population is well within an expected set of core competencies.  further, clinical information improvements from the greater specificity (goal of icd10, 11 and snomed) will yield important insights over the intermediate and longer term.  these are extremely important policy issues that will benefit from increased support.\n allowing risk adjustment to move more freely, while still normalizing back to a national 1.0 score provides delivery systems with substantive incentive to increase specificity, while protecting the trust fund from \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaming\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  applied in a zero-sum fashion, those acos that continue to document and code in a substandard fashion would bear the consequence of inferior administrative skills and ability.  inferior documentation and coding efforts degrade the ability of the improved information set to provide insights to the entire system. there is a real system consequence for this substandard information set, it is only appropriate that a consequence flow to substandard information providers. this should be applied to both ma and the shared savings program consistently.\n second is the sharing rates of savings within the programs.  in a fashion similar to the ma stars program, superior performances should be rewarded more directly economically and with some portion rewarding beneficiaries using the high quality/lowest cost delivery system. for example:\n quality score level a  level b  level c  level d  level e  enhanced 95-100 35% 35% 45% 55% 70% 80% 92-94.9 30% 30% 40% 50% 50% 75%\n89.0-91.9 25% 25% 30% 40% 45% 65% \n 86-88.9 20% 20% 25% 35% 40% 60% lt 85.9% 0 0 0 0 0 0\n combined with the regional benchmark suggestions above, the high quality low cost system would have an advantage that would drive a favorable competitive response from the other delivery systems in the area.  as the other delivery systems converge, cms is harvesting savings as the economics become level at a lower cost and sharing rate, data specificity is driven to a very high level, and beneficiaries now have more choices in high quality and low cost healthcare.\n\n expansion of aipbp to the shared savings program: acos face enormous working capital burdens.  aipbp may provide some relief from these burdens in the form of an interim cash flow.  to be certain, this program should only be extended to mspp contractors at level d or higher risk and would be 100% additive to the downside risk exposure otherwise calculated in the program.  further, expected payments would have to expand the financial guarantee otherwise provided, to assure the trust fund is not at risk for the payments provided which are beyond the financial guarantee provided by the aco we recommend 50% of the expected amount be added to the financial guarantee.  to protect the trust fund yet further, if the experience through june 30 of the performance year indicated that there would be a deficit (prospectively assigned acos) the payments would be suspended and held by cms.  lastly, if the aco where to have expenses above the calculated benchmark, 100% of the aipbp funding would be recaptured by cms before any sharing percentage would be applied.\n there are several benefits beyond simply cash flow that would accrue to the beneficiaries, trust fund, and cms.  these are \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 providers contracted in the aipbp would be more deeply integrated for customer service, care coordination, medical appropriateness, and timely information sharing. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 acos would be incentivized to provide educate for all aco providers on who are the aipbp providers, install processes and programs to improve access, monitoring compliance, expanding information sharing with aipbp providers for quality improvement and consistent health care outcomes. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 acos would take much greater interest in the performance of all providers treating their assigned beneficiaries. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 post-acute providers and treatment pathways would be investigated deeply.\n vehicle for medical necessity determinations and claims appeal: there needs to be a vehicle to engage the health care providers beyond submitting a set of documents to the oig for a fraud investigation.  not all events raise to the level of intentional fraud.  some events are simply clumsy data input, others may be less than energetic pursuit of lower cost alternatives or seeking prior treatment records.  further, most ma contractors provide this vehicle to their downstream risk/gain sharing provider groups.  this is not

the trust fund and the aco.  very quickly, service providers would seek to engage acos to comply with quality programs, care navigation standards, updated treatment pathways, and care coordination

administrator verma:\n we appreciate the centers for medicare and medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) efforts to improve the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and agree with the fundamental goal of the proposed rule\u00e2\u0080\u0094to strengthen incentives for accountable care organizations (acos) to reduce wasteful health care spending.  as academic researchers, we have published numerous studies assessing the effects of medicare aco programs on spending and quality and have written extensively about the weak incentives in the mssp and the options for reform.1  we believe that health policy should be evidence-based to the extent possible and should anticipate the dynamic consequences of changes in incentives.  although we agree that stronger incentives for acos to reduce medicare spending could accelerate the early success of the mssp, we are concerned that several key provisions in the proposed rule are at odds with existing evidence and could lead, conversely, to higher medicare spending when implemented in the context of a voluntary program.\n 1 mcwilliams, j. m., b. e. landon, et al.

fully accounting for patient factors.  implementing such a model too quickly, however, will likely have harmful effects on participation that act to increase rather than decrease medicare spending. in short, the proposed convergence of aco benchmarks within markets could cause the voluntary mssp to unravel, particularly when additional risk-bearing is imposed. thus, we believe that the primary goal of the mssp at this stage should be to reduce excessive spending so as to cause convergence in spending between providers and allow future consideration of a longer-term model in which payments might be set regionally as in medicare advantage.  as long as the mssp is voluntary and there is wide variation in spending, this goal can only be attained by strongly encouraging the participation of providers serving patients who receive less efficient care and establishing strong incentives for those providers to reduce wasteful spending.  below, we summarize and then detail our key concerns, their empirical and conceptual bases, and our recommended changes to the rule. we sincerely hope our analyses and comments are helpful in your deliberations and would be happy to discuss them further.\n summary our chief concern is that the combination of requiring risk for spending in excess of benchmarks (downside risk) and earlier blending of historical benchmarks with average regional spending via the regional adjustments will introduce even stronger incentives for acos with high spending for their patients to exit the mssp and for providers with already low spending to remain in or join the mssp. such systematic selection has already occurred and will grow worse as regionalization of benchmarks and downside risk are imposed. there is strong evidence of strategic participation decisions by acos already (summarized below).  if the mssp is to cause convergence in spending by encouraging acos with high spending to reduce wasteful care, it needs to retain and attract providers with high spending and give them strong incentives to lower it.  although downside risk and regionalized benchmarks strengthen incentives to save, only providers who participate will be exposed to the stronger incentives.  as acos with high spending exit and those with low spending enter and continue in the mssp, acos will appear to be performing better against their benchmarks (ostensibly greater savings per program metrics) but the true impact of the program will be a substantial increase in medicare spending in the form of subsidies to already more efficient acos. to the extent that risk-adjustment is incomplete, regionalizing benchmarks will also cause unmerited financial transfers from providers serving healthy and socially advantaged patients to those serving sicker and disadvantaged patients.\n 3\n particularly among physician groups and acos with high initial spending.2,3,4,5  while incentives have been very weak and should be strengthened, we believe that it is important to refine the mssp in ways that build on those early gains rather than risk reversion and a squandering of providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 demonstrated willingness to try to reign in excessive spending.\n therefore, while we agree with the goal of strengthening incentives to save, we recommend a direction that differs from the proposed rule in key respects.  specifically, to encourage participation and foster convergence in spending while the mssp remains a voluntary program, we recommend eliminating regional benchmark adjustments, eliminating the rebasing of benchmarks that has greatly diminished aco incentives to ever save, and increasing the shared savings rate according to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending relative to their regional average.  given the evidence that physician group acos have generated greater savings than larger hospital-integrated organizations, we agree with the spirit of proposed provisions that favor participation by low-revenue groups but would go even further to do so.  specifically, we recommend that requirements to assume downside risk be applied only to acos with high revenues on par with those generated by health systems providing inpatient, outpatient, and specialty care (i.e., accounting for a high proportion of medicare spending for their patients).  lower-revenue acos should still be able to elect downside risk in exchange for favorable regulatory treatment and higher shared-savings rates.  program results and design should be revisited regularly, with monitoring of within- market spending variation to guide consideration of a longer-term payment model at a future time.  such an approach would establish strong incentives for all acos to lower wasteful spending, regardless of initial efficiency, by allowing acos time to recoup up-front investments and by eliminating penalties (in the form of lower benchmarks) for achieving savings.  such an approach also would afford the time necessary to modernize risk- adjustment methods to address \u00e2\u0080\u009cupdcoding\u00e2\u0080\u009d and unintended consequences for disparities.\n in addition to these core recommendations, we also offer suggestions for improving the methods for risk adjustment, trending benchmark updates, addressing compositional changes in aco provider participants, and determining aco organizational revenue.\n in summary, we believe a conclusion that the mssp has been a failure after 6 years of operation is inappropriate. the incentives for participating acos to lower spending have always been weak\u00e2\u0080\u0094the program can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have failed if there was never much opportunity for success. moreover, the mssp has generated meaningful savings from physician groups, for whom the incentives have been stronger.  ideally at the outset, the program would have had sufficiently strong incentives to allow more definitive judgment of its success.  delivery system reform is a slow process, and the voluntary nature of the mssp limits the options for strengthening incentives, but incentives to save in a voluntary program can be strong without discouraging participation.  for these reasons, we believe that the proposed changes to aco benchmarking and risk-sharing are premature and counterproductive and that other available strategies should be pursued to accelerate progress.\n 4\n key points \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the mssp has generated net savings to medicare \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 benchmarks are not valid counterfactuals \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 regional blending of

for assessing program \n savings, base assessments of program impact solely on studies that are well designed to estimate it.  benchmarks need not be redesigned to be valid counterfactuals\u00e2\u0080\u0094their purpose is to set incentives\u00e2\u0080\u0094but they should not be used for program evaluation.\n2. set the shared-savings rate at a minimum of 50% for all acos in all performance years \n and tracks.\n3. eliminate rebasing of benchmarks that links an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new benchmark to its spending \n changes in the prior period.  this link should be severed completely.  instead, an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original baseline should be updated annually according to a growth rate that is unrelated to its prior performance, adjusting for changes in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participating providers.\n4. eliminate regional adjustments that blend aco historical benchmarks with regional \n spending.  replace with shared savings rates that rise continuously with lower aco spending relative to its region, starting at 50% for acos with the highest spending for their region and rising to 80% for acos with the lowest spending for their region.\n5. eliminate downside risk requirements for lower-revenue acos by retaining track 1, \n eliminating the basic track, and allowing voluntary participation in track 1+.  replace the \u00e2\u0080\u009cclinician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d basis for determining loss limits in track 1+ with the proposed revenue-based determination (revenue/total spending for aco population).\n6. continue to require high-revenue acos to assume downside risk commensurate with \n the enhanced track but set the threshold for defining high revenue at a higher level corresponding to an integrated health system. also require downside risk of very large physician groups with market power. rather than rely solely on participant lists, use additional data on full organizational structure to determine organization-wide revenue for core practices responsible for attribution.\n7. eliminate cap on downward benchmark adjustments that result from decreases in risk \n 5\n average in the future (not in the near term per recommendation 4), implement additional payments or benchmark adjustments so that acos are not penalized for serving higher-risk patients.\n8. remove an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed population from benchmark update determinations to \n preserve incentives for acos to lower spending. use multilevel statistical modeling approaches to estimate aco-specific update factors that reflect regional and national trends, with greater weight placed on national trends for aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that serve higher proportions of patients in their service area.  after a phase of program expansion, switch to using a desirable preset rate of benchmark growth applied to all acos.\n the mssp has generated net savings to medicare the use of benchmarks to assess the impact of the mssp on medicare spending has caused much confusion about whether the mssp has produced savings to medicare net of bonuses and the extent of those savings.  program benchmarks are important because they establish the incentives for acos to participate and lower spending.  but understanding aco responses to those incentives requires rigorous evaluation in which spending for aco- attributed patients is compared with spending that would be expected to have occurred in the absence of aco participation in the mssp (the counterfactual).  benchmarks are not valid counterfactuals for a variety of reasons, several of which have caused benchmark- based assessments to underestimate savings in the mssp (at least through 2016).  first, until 2017, benchmarks were updated with the use of national spending growth rates (in absolute dollars/year).  because medicare spending growth varies geographically, this feature of benchmark setting meant that an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark differed systematically from its counterfactual (expected) spending in almost all cases.  the direction of the bias has differed for acos in areas of faster vs. slower spending growth, and the average effect has been to significantly underestimate expected spending because the national growth rate (updated factor) was determined among all ffs medicare beneficiaries, including those with no primary care services to support attribution.  beneficiaries with no qualifying services, on average, have much lower spending and thus lower spending growth rates in absolute terms.  for example, we estimate that medicare spending growth from 2013 to 2016 was $140/beneficiary slower among all beneficiaries than among those with at least one office visit with a primary care physician. based on this difference, the national growth rate used to set benchmarks underestimated spending reductions achieved by acos for their primary care patients from 2013-2016 by approximately 1.3 percentage points.\n second, any spending reductions achieved by acos contribute to a slowing in national spending growth, causing benchmarks to fall.  for example, based on our most recent analysis of mssp savings,6 spending reductions achieved by the 2012-2014 entry cohorts of acos caused their benchmarks in 2015 to be approximately 0.3 percentage points lower than if they did not lower spending.  third, rebasing of aco benchmarks at the outset of second agreement periods that lowers benchmarks according to the extent of spending reductions achieved in the first period causes benchmarks in the second period to diverge even further below counterfactual spending, causing further underestimation of savings. this occurred for the 2012-2013 entry cohorts when they began their second agreement\n 6\n periods in 2016.  other features of benchmark setting have had less predictable effects but also could have contributed to underestimation of savings. for example, the approach to risk adjustment has appropriately tried to address other program goals, such as mitigating incentives to increase diagnosis coding intensity, but in the process may have not accurately reflected changes in the health risk of patients served by acos.\n for these reasons, analyses using aco benchmarks to quantify mssp savings are uninformative and should be ignored when assessing program savings.  benchmarks are of obvious importance in establishing incentives and determining performance bonuses but are not valid counterfactuals and yield highly misleading results when used to assess program impact.  for example, whereas benchmark comparisons would suggest that the mssp caused cumulative net losses to medicare of $266m in 2014 and 2015 (including shared-savings bonuses), our evaluations, which use local concurrent spending changes to establish counterfactual spending, more accurately quantify the impact of the program as generating $431m in cumulative savings to medicare over those two years after accounting for bonuses \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a $697m difference from benchmark-based savings estimates.  these greater savings are also consistent with market-level analyses conducted by government analysts and other researchers (including those summarized in the regulatory impact analysis of the proposed rule).  the review of the evidence in the regulatory impact analysis is at odds with characterizations of one-sided contracts in the mssp (e.g., on\np.41787) as an unaffordable option that increases medicare spending. \n\n although the direct savings we estimated are modest, the total savings to medicare are greater because of spillover effects.7  changes in care for patients attributed to acos are likely to affect medicare beneficiaries served by acos but not attributed to one.8  moreover, reductions in ffs medicare spending achieved by acos in turn lower payment rates to medicare advantage plans.  particularly because of the large size of the growing medicare advantage program, these spillovers are substantial, approximately doubling the net savings to medicare from the mssp based on our previously published calculations.9\n moreover, the savings have varied with the strength of incentives to which acos are exposed, suggesting that refinements that strengthen incentives without compromising participation would lead to greater savings.  in particular, we have consistently found that savings are significantly greater among physician-group acos than hospital-integrated acos.10,11,12,13  because physician groups provide less of the care spectrum, they have much\n 7 mcwilliams, j. (2016). \"savings from acos\u00e2\u0080\u0094building on early success.\" annals of internal medicine 165(12): 873-\n875. \n 7\n stronger incentives to reduce spending.  all else equal, acos have stronger incentives to lower spending on care they do not provide than care they do provide.  when acos lower spending on care they provide, any resulting shared-savings bonuses are offset to some extent by foregone fee-for-service profits.  similarly, spillover effects on non-aco patients (including commercially insured patients) have greater financial consequences for larger hospital-based acos.  if a primary care-focused aco implements systemic care redesigns to reduce excessive inpatient or specialty care for all of its patients (not just those covered by its mssp contract), it does not incur losses in revenue for non-aco patients.  thus, physician groups have much stronger incentives as acos to lower spending and to implement more systemic changes that affect care for all patients. not only have savings been convincingly higher for physician group acos but they have also been growing over time consistently in each mssp entry cohort.12  in our analyses, we have also confirmed that the greater savings estimated for physician groups are not due to those acos being located in higher-spending or higher-use regions or having higher spending for their regions (we obtain similar results when adjusting for those factors).  because physician groups effectively have a higher shared-savings rate (because they incur lower offsetting costs when lowering spending), these findings foreshadow the additional savings that may be realized if shared savings rates are increased.\n savings have varied with strength of incentives in other ways, too.  for example, savings have been particularly pronounced in post-acute care, a leading source of waste in medicare which most acos do not provide and thus almost universally have strong incentives to limit.  in addition, assuming the costs of reducing spending are lower when spending is higher (where there is more waste it is easier to cut), savings should be greater for acos with higher baseline spending for their region or in higher-spending regions. indeed, that has been observed as well.10\n recommendation 1: because benchmark-based calculations are not informative for assessing program savings, we urge cms to base assessments of program impact solely on studies that are well designed to estimate it. benchmarks need not be redesigned to be valid counterfactuals\u00e2\u0080\u0094their purpose is to set incentives\u00e2\u0080\u0094but they should not be used for program evaluation.\n current incentives weak for reasons other than lack of downside risk there is near-universal agreement that incentives have been weak in the mssp, but the discourse has focused almost exclusively on the lack of downside risk in mssp contracts as the cause of weak incentives.  the proposed rule intends to correct this perceived flaw by requiring currently participating high-revenue acos to assume significant downside risk immediately by entering the enhanced track, requiring new high-revenue participants to enter the enhanced track after 5 years, and requiring all new entrants and continuing low-revenue acos to assume some downside risk after 2 years of participation in the basic track.  however, there are other major reasons why incentives to lower spending have been weak in the mssp and thus other options for strengthening them.\n 8\n imperfect quality scores reduce the shared savings rate, it has been even lower, averaging\n44.2% in 2014 and 47.8% in 2017.  such shared-savings rates offer limited opportunities to \n profit relative to the status quo because acos incur substantial costs from being an aco and attempting to earn shared savings.14 these include the costs of aco governance and quality reporting, efforts to lower spending and improve performance on quality measures, and (if those efforts are successful) any offsetting losses in profits as described above. accordingly, the proposed reduction in the shared savings rate to 25-35% for acos in all levels of the basic track except level e is likely to eliminate opportunities for acos to save on net, reduce aco investments, and therefore reduce the savings to medicare generated by acos and attract fewer acos into the program.\n second, the rebasing of the historical component of aco benchmarks every 3 years to reflect an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most recent 3 years of spending greatly diminishes acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 incentives to ever save because spending reductions now are penalized with lower benchmarks later.15 to the extent that the costs of lowering spending are fixed (e.g., upfront investments with permanent effects on spending), rebasing reduces the time acos have to recoup those costs.  to the extent that the costs of lowering spending are variable (must be incurred each time spending is reduced), expending effort to reduce wasteful services in a given year might contribute to shared savings for that performance year (if the minimum savings rate is exceeded) but will definitely cause the benchmark in the next agreement period to be lower and below the expected spending level under a status quo in which the effort is not expended again.  thus, in a contract with symmetric upside and downside risk, variable cost interventions (even if effective) pose a present-day net cost to acos.15\n for example, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say it costs a physician group aco $1000 in care manager salary to prevent one $10,000 hospital admission through patient monitoring and timely engagement, diverting patients away from emergency departments and to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary care practices when possible.  for simplicity, assume 1-year agreement periods. the aco will receive $5,000 in shared savings for a net $4,000 savings from such effort in the first agreement period, but its benchmark in the subsequent period will be lowered by $10,000, posing a $5,000 future loss (assuming 50% shared losses) and thus a net $1000 present day cost from the care manager\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort if the aco plans to stay in the program for a second period.  the aco can expend the $1000 in care management again in the second period to avoid the penalty (it no longer produces a bonus from doing so because the benchmark is lowered), but as long as it participates in the program it must do so indefinitely, in every year of participation, to avoid the penalty (because spending will rise back to its previous level if the variable cost is not incurred).  thus, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incentives are either to never try to prevent admissions or to try to do so and then leave the program.16\n the key point is that acos have had little incentive to ever lower spending because of the link between the spending reductions they achieve and subsequent benchmarks. one could argue that it is astonishing that the mssp has produced any savings at all.  not surprisingly,\n 9\n dropout in the 2012 and 2013 entry cohorts of acos was most marked when their benchmarks were set to be rebased at the start of their second agreement periods in 2016. specifically, 44 of 191 acos (23%) left the program between 2015 and 2016 after annual exit rates averaging just 6.6% from 2013-2015 over the first agreement period.\n recommendation 2: set the shared-savings rate at a minimum of 50% for all acos in all performance years and tracks.\n recommendation 3: eliminate rebasing of benchmarks that links an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new benchmark to its spending changes in the prior period.  this link should be completely severed.  instead, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original baseline should be updated annually according to a growth rate that is unrelated to its prior performance, adjusting for changes in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participating providers.\n two concerns have been raised about the approach we are recommending, but we believe they have received too much weight in deliberations over mssp rules to date and are addressable.  first, without rebasing aco benchmarks down to their more recent levels of spending, some have commented that this will allow acos with initially high spending to eventually earn windfall profits.  we agree that some high-spending acos would be able to earn sizeable shared-savings bonuses eventually and believe that a principal goal of the mssp should be to avail such opportunities.  but shared savings are not equal to profits for the reasons we note above; they may be largely offset by the costs of lowering spending17 and program participation.  for many acos with initially high spending, particularly high- revenue acos that incur offsetting losses in ffs profits when restricting provision of care, the mssp may merely offer an opportunity to mitigate those losses as they lower spending to levels of efficiency offered by other providers in their area.  that may nevertheless be a goal of providers with high spending, particularly if they know with greater certainty the long-term direction of medicare payment policy.  but they will be unlikely to participate and pursue that goal if the costs are made too great by downside risk and regional blending.  as we discuss below, concerns about an uneven playing field between acos with higher vs. lower spending in the same market can be addressed by increasing the shared- savings rate for more efficient acos.  in addition, under both the current and proposed rules, benchmarks will be progressively reduced by the annual benchmark updates as the program matures and expands, because regional and national spending growth will progressively slow as acos increasingly lower medicare spending.  thus, the annual updates will still apply downward pressure on aco benchmarks, thereby limiting aco profits.  the key distinctions are that, with rebasing eliminated: 1) the downward pressure on benchmarks would be at a rate that appropriately lags behind the downward effect acos have on spending as opposed to at an equal rate (thereby encouraging participation); and 2) the downward pressure on a given aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark would not be caused by its own efforts to lower spending (thereby strengthening incentives to save).\n second, concerns have been raised about the ability to adequately adjust for changes in aco provider composition over longer periods of time.  an inability to do so could allow acos to select more efficient practices (taxpayer identification numbers [tins]) for\n 10\n inclusion to earn shared savings without lowering spending.  more generally, the clinicians and practices represented by a given tin may change substantially because of mergers and acquisitions, and tins may newly appear or cease to appear in claims.  these challenges can be addressed with relatively straightforward approaches, several of which we have implemented in our evaluations of the mssp.18,19  when an aco adds tins to their participant list, the baseline period for those tins could be established as the 3 years prior to the addition (i.e., different parts of the aco would have different baseline periods).  for tins that exhibit large changes from baseline to performance years in the number of clinicians billing under them or that newly appear in claims, npi-tin billing relationships can be used to identify additional tins in the original baseline period to assess baseline spending for a set of providers that is more consistent with an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participant list in a given performance year.  for tins where provider consistency between performance and baseline years is tenuous and cannot be corrected with such methods, rebasing could be allowed for the portion of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark accounted for by such tins.  moreover, to the extent that the mssp encourages acos to include more efficient providers in their contracts, that may help foster competition among providers to be efficient and attractive to acos.  thus, such behavior should not necessarily be viewed as wasteful gaming.\n problems with regional benchmark adjustments and evidence of cost- increasing participation decisions in the 2014 cohort the regional adjustment in the current benchmarking methodology, particularly when implemented in an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first agreement period as proposed, is highly problematic in a voluntary mssp, particularly if downside risk is imposed on participants.  it will surely lead to exit by acos with spending above their region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s average.  these acos with high baseline spending have produced greater savings than acos with lower spending18,20 and are critical to retain and attract if the mssp is to ever cause sufficient within-market convergence in spending to facilitate a transition to a longer-term payment system in which providers bear risk and population-based benchmarks are similar for different providers in the same market (accounting for patient factors).\n there is evidence already of acos with high spending for their region selectively exiting the program in response to the prospect of regional benchmark adjustments.  as noted in the proposed rule, the 25-35% blending of acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 historical benchmarks with regional average spending led to substantial swings in benchmarks in 2017 for acos that started in 2014.  this was to be expected from the documented wide variation acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk-adjusted spending relative to their service areas.21   as described in the table below, introduction of the regional adjustment in 2017 was associated with 21% dropout in the 2014 cohort and more than a quadrupling of the mean \u00e2\u0080\u009csavings rate\u00e2\u0080\u009d among remaining participants (from\n0.5% to 2.2%).  the \u00e2\u0080\u009csavings rate\u00e2\u0080\u009d indicates where an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending was relative to its \n benchmark, with positive values indicating that spending was below the benchmark.  to distinguish this quantity from estimates of actual aco savings estimated by rigorous evaluations, we refer to this quantity as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbenchmark savings rate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the increase in the\n 11\n benchmark savings rate in 2017 for the 2014 cohort (bolded in the table) was the most substantial increase observed in any entry cohort in any pair of years and thus unlikely due to improvement in aco performance alone.  the other year-to-year increases in benchmark savings rates were much more modest, including those associated with rebasing and extensive dropout in 2016 for the 2012-2013 cohorts.  of the remaining acos from the 2014 entry cohort, 81% had positive regional adjustments in 2017, meaning that their historical benchmarks were below average regional spending and thus that their participation was subsidized.  this pattern is highly suggestive of selective dropout of acos with spending above their regional average, causing the appearance of increased savings that would be more accurately characterized as subsidies to acos with lower spending.\n\n\n\n entry year 2015 performance 2016 performance 2017 performance n

claims data, we confirmed that acos in the 2014 cohort that exited the program in 2017 had substantially higher spending for their region than those who remained in the program.  specifically, we fit a model of total spending per beneficiary in 2014-15 as a function of county and year fixed effects and fixed effects for acos in the 2014 cohort. the latter set of fixed effects estimated the mean spending difference between each aco in the 2014 cohort and its service area.  this spending deviation was, on average, $787/beneficiary higher for acos dropping out than for those remaining in the mssp.\n 12\n we understand that the costs of lowering spending are likely greater for acos with lower spending (less \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-hanging fruit\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and that acos already providing more efficient care have voiced concerns that basing benchmarks solely on acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 historical spending creates unfairly greater opportunities for providers who have been historically less efficient. providers who are more efficient than others, however, are not necessarily efficient.  for example, in our empirical work on low-value care in medicare, we found that providers who provide the least low-value care still provide more low-value care than the difference between the most and least efficient providers.22,23  therefore, acos with low spending for their region should be able to reduce wasteful spending further, but likely require greater rewards to cover the higher costs of doing so.  therefore, to retain and attract acos with lower spending and to recognize their greater level of efficiency and the greater challenge they face in further reducing spending, we recommend replacing the regional adjustment with higher shared savings rates for acos with lower spending for their service area.  this could be implemented in a graded fashion, with shared savings rates rising continuously from a minimum of 50% for acos with the highest spending for their region to 80% for acos with the lowest spending for their region, using the most recent 2 years to assess acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 standing relative to their region.  relating the shared-savings rate to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 most recent level of spending will also strengthen incentives for acos to lower spending.\n it is important to recognize that higher shared savings rates do not mean lesser savings for medicare.  first, higher shared savings rates should attract more providers into the mssp. so even if medicare receives a lower proportion of the savings for a given aco, there should be more acos generating savings. second, higher shared savings rates should elicit stronger efforts by acos to lower spending.  to date, acos with spending below their regional average have not produced significant savings.  therefore, increasing the savings rate for an aco with low spending for their region can only increase savings to medicare from that aco, on average. third, because a higher shared savings rate does not apply to savings from spillover effects (e.g., lower medicare advantage payment rates), increasing the shared-savings rate will reduce the amount of savings to medicare from a given aco with a given performance level much less than the change in the percentage would indicate.\n finally, it is also important to bear in mind that most acos provide only some of the care spectrum (lower revenue acos).  these acos tend to be primary care or multispecialty physician groups.  thus, much of the inefficient care delivered to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population may not be provided by the aco.  accordingly, such inefficient care offers opportunities for efficient physician groups to enter those communities and reduce spending as acos.\n recommendation 4: eliminate regional adjustments that blend aco historical benchmarks with regional spending.  replace with shared savings rates that rise continuously with lower aco spending relative to its region, starting at 50% for acos with the highest spending for their region and rising to 80% for acos with the lowest spending for their region.\n\n 13\n downsides of downside risk not only can incentives in the mssp be strengthened without imposing downside risk for spending in excess of benchmarks, but downside risk may ultimately strengthen incentives very little and will likely cause more problems than it solves, acting to diminish instead of increase savings to medicare.\n as a preliminary point, it is important to recognize that track 1 is not riskless.  as described above, all acos incur significant administrative and reporting costs to participate in the mssp, and those that try to lower spending or improve quality incur additional costs.  these costs pose a potential downside even if the risk-sharing is one- sided.  acos lose money if they fail to earn sufficiently high shared-savings to offset the costs of participation and effort to achieve savings.  as evidence that track 1 is a downside risk track, the rate of dropout from the mssp has been substantial, and acos that have dropped out are disproportionately those that did not receive shared-savings bonuses. specifically by 2018, 40-45% of acos in the 2012-2013 entry cohort and 35% of the 2014 cohort had exited the mssp.  benchmark savings rates were substantially lower among acos dropping out than among those staying in the program.  in the 2012-2013 cohorts, for example, the mean benchmark savings rate among acos that have dropped out was\n0.37% before they dropped out, compared with 1.44% among those continuing in the \n program.  if track 1 were riskless, acos not receiving bonuses would stay in the program. given that dropout has been substantial and driven largely by the limited performance-based risk already present in track 1, we should expect that additional downside risk in the form of two-sided risk sharing will accelerate dropout and discourage participation.\n 14\n that provisions that would further discourage participation by acos that do not perform well against their benchmarks (downside risk and regional adjustment of benchmarks) would be detrimental to the program.\n since the enhanced track is essentially the pioneer model, the 50% dropout rate observed in the pioneer model should also serve as a cautionary tale about the extent of voluntary participation that should be expected in the enhanced track.  (only 16 of the 32 pioneer acos remained in two-sided models [pioneer or next generation] by 2016). limiting participation in the mssp by high-revenue organizations, however, may prove to be sound policy if a goal of the mssp is to foster competition by offering shared savings opportunities that appeal selectively to smaller organizations and physician groups.\n as another point of evidence that is important for considering downside risk requirements, recent assertions that the downside risk tracks (2, 3, and now 1+) have caused greater savings are misleading and we believe incorrect.  some analysts, including the medicare payment advisory commission,24 have observed that acos participating in tracks 2 and 3 have higher benchmark savings rates and have concluded that downside risk elicits greater savings.  however, only a small percentage of acos have participated in track 2 or 3 (8% in 2018), and most of them transitioned into these tracks after experience in track 1 (as of 2015, 99% of acos were in track 1).  thus, these acos were able to select into track 2 or 3 to take advantage of the higher shared-savings rates after ascertaining that their spending would continue to be below their benchmarks, whether because of preceding success in lowering spending or other factors that cause benchmarks to deviate from counterfactual spending.  indeed, of the 32 acos that transitioned from track 1 to track 2 or 3 by 2018, the mean benchmark savings rate was 3.6% over the 3 years prior to changing tracks, vs. just\n0.6% among other acos remaining in track 1.  for the subgroup of acos that entered track \n 2 or 3 in 2016 or 2017, the 1-2 years of downside risk exposure did not affect that pre- existing difference in benchmark savings rates, which remained similar in 2017 (3.5% for acos in tracks 2/3 vs. 1.3% for acos in track 1), suggesting that entry into a track with downside risk contributed no additional savings.  the mean benchmark savings rate in the 3 years prior to transitioning to track 1+ was similarly high (2.3%) among acos leaving track 1 for track 1+ in 2018.  the mean benchmark savings rate in 2017 among acos that entered track 2 or 3 directly, without a prior agreement period in track 1, was much lower\n(0.8%) than among acos selecting into downside risk tracks after experience in track 1.   \n\n in addition, we know from evaluations of the pioneer model25,26 that spending reductions in that 2-sided model were no greater than those achieved in 1-sided contracts in the mssp. similarly, the evidence shows that the two-sided next generation (next gen) model has performed no better than track 1 of the mssp when accounting for duration of participation in an aco program. specifically, the recent evaluation of year 1 of the next gen model by norc found gross annual savings of $210/beneficiary in 2016, but 15 of the\n 15\n 18 acos participating in next gen had significant prior experience in the pioneer model or mssp, including 2 of the 4 acos that drove the bulk of the savings.  these gross savings from next gen are no bigger than those achieved in the mssp when appropriately compared with mssp acos with multiple years of experience.  for example, in our recently published evaluation of the mssp, we found gross annual savings of $213/beneficiary in 2015 for acos entering in 2012 or 2013 (slightly greater than the next gen estimate).  thus, there is no evidence to date that downside risk has enhanced gross savings in medicare aco contracts, and thus no evidence that downside risk has elicited a stronger response from acos.\n without eliciting stronger efforts by acos to lower spending, downside risk does allow cms to recoup a portion of spending in excess of benchmarks.  for example, the 2016 net savings per beneficiary in next gen ($130/beneficiary in net savings to medicare) were greater than the 2015 net savings per beneficiary in the 2012-2013 entry cohorts of mssp acos ($62/beneficiary) despite the similar gross savings.  however, the net savings achieved by the 18 acos in next gen (most of which are large health systems) were smaller than the net savings generated by physician-group acos in the mssp ($180/beneficiary) and constituted much smaller aggregate net savings than produced by the more popular mssp ($62m from next gen\nvs. $190m from all 2012-2013 entrants in the mssp).  this underscores the importance of \n allowing physician groups (lower revenue organizations) to participate in one-sided contracts and suggests that downside risk could be used by cms to protect against losses from health systems, whose incentives in one-sided contracts are very weak. but we would note that any losses recouped by cms by requiring downside risk are likely to be at least partially, if not fully, offset by the increase in advanced apm bonus payments for providers accepting downside risk.  in addition, because the advanced apm bonus is structured as 5% of part b revenue, it acts to weaken incentives for acos to reduce provision of wasteful part b services (the size of the bonus is reduced when part b revenue is reduced).\n all else equal, we agree that introducing downside risk-sharing strengthens incentives for acos to lower spending.  but all else will not remain equal if downside risk is imposed, particularly because the mssp is voluntary and the proposed introduction of downside risk is coupled with regional blending of benchmarks.  since acos with spending above their regional average will disproportionately exit the program, most remaining acos will have spending below their regional average and thus benchmarks above their historical spending.  for those acos, downside risk adds little additional incentive to lower spending below the status quo because the incentive to lower spending when spending is below the benchmark stems from the upside risk sharing provisions. the cost of maintaining the status quo for those acos is the foregone profits from not earning more shared savings, not penalties from downside risk.  thus, because of the anticipated participation losses, imposing downside risk may not significantly strengthen incentives for remaining acos.\n 16\n losses, particularly when sustained repeatedly over multiple years.  because many acos will seek to mitigate their risk of losses, the extent to which downside risk incentives will reach the levels of organization currently exposed to one-sided incentives is unclear.  since health management firms take a cut of any shared savings, requiring downside risk will also weaken upside risk incentives for acos that partner with such firms.\n moreover, provider responses to mitigate downside risk will act to erode a key advantage of the aco model over the medicare advantage model \u00e2\u0080\u0093 lower administrative costs from direct contracting between medicare and providers.  as more acos pay premiums for reinsurance premiums and fees to management firms (which may take the form of a cut of shared savings), the administrative costs of the program will grow.\n finally, a stated motivation in the proposed rule for imposing downside risk is to discourage abuse of the program by provider organizations that participate to exploit waivers from stark and anti-kickback law and engage in anticompetitive behavior.  the proposed rule goes so far as to state, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfurther, the presence of an \u00e2\u0080\u0098upside-only\u00e2\u0080\u0099 track may be encouraging consolidation in the marketplace, reducing competition and choice for medicare ffs beneficiaries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  while this is certainly a valid concern, we are aware of no empirical evidence supporting this statement.  in fact, research to date has found little evidence of greater consolidation among aco participants as a result of the mssp.27 consolidation had been occurring before the mssp and has generally continued for other reasons.  while there may have been some defensive consolidation among non-aco providers27 (e.g. to rebuff payer attempts to engage them in aco risk contracts), that would not be addressed by changing risk-sharing provisions among mssp participants.  mssp participation has also not been associated with detectable changes in referrals, as measured by leakage.  specifically, mssp participation has not been associated with evidence of acos effectively steering outpatient specialty referrals internally to aco specialists.28  while this area remains one in need of further investigation, we do not believe it is appropriate to conclude that the mssp has contributed to consolidation or anticompetitive control over referrals.  given that the mssp model presents greater opportunities for physician groups (for the reasons described above) one could even argue that the mssp could contribute to greater competition in provider markets, as long as it continues to favor lower-revenue organizational structures in its incentives.\n moreover, use of downside risk to deter gaming or anticompetitive behavior implicitly assumes that the financial gains from abusing the program are smaller than the gains from genuinely engaging in efforts to lower spending.  however, the opposite is more like likely to be the case.  attempts to lower spending are fraught with uncertainty, challenges, and offsetting costs, and have not been strongly rewarded in the mssp because of rebasing and low shared savings rates, whereas engaging in anticompetitive behavior to enhance ffs profits is likely to be far more predictable and lucrative.  a health system could participate in the mssp to take advantage of waivers to maintain or increase referrals for inpatient and\n 17\n specialty care without affecting total medicare spending (i.e., only causing a shift in care that favors the health system). such behavior would increase provider revenue without resulting in penalties under downside risk. thus, requiring downside risk is likely to selectively discourage acos joining the program for the right reasons, while acos joining the program for the wrong reasons may not be dissuaded by downside risk as much because the gains from regulatory relief may outweigh any potential losses.  we would favor measures to identify abuses directly over blunt uses of downside risk requirements that risk having unintended consequences.\n in summary, there is no evidence that downside risk has elicited greater savings in medicare aco programs, and imposing downside risk in a voluntary program with regionally adjusted benchmarks is likely to induce cost-increasing participation losses and higher administrative costs, without achieving the goals of stronger incentives and selectively deterring abuse.\n recommendation 5: eliminate downside risk requirements for lower-revenue acos by retaining track 1, eliminating the basic track, and allowing voluntary participation in track\n1+.  replace the \u00e2\u0080\u009cclinician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d basis for determining loss limits in track 1+ with the proposed \n revenue-based determination (aco revenue for medicare patients/total medicare spending for assigned population).\n recommendation 6: continue to require high-revenue acos to assume downside risk commensurate with the enhanced track but set the threshold for defining high revenue at a higher level corresponding to an integrated health system. also require downside risk of very large physician groups with market power. rather than rely solely on participant lists, use additional data on full organizational structure to determine organization-wide revenue for core practices responsible for attribution.\n we make the last part of recommendation 6 because we are concerned that acos, particularly high-revenue acos, may game revenue determinations if the aco participant lists are used to determine aco revenue, as proposed in the proposed rule.  for example, a large health system could include only its provider organizations or primary care practices in order to be judged as a low-revenue aco without significantly altering its attributed population.  for example, a large health system may own several hospitals and multiple physician groups, each billing under distinct tins.  or a health system may consist of a hospital system with a closely aligned provider organization billing under its own tin.  in such cases, which are common, the physician groups or provider organizations account for all or nearly all of the attribution but the hospitals and other facilities account for much of the revenue.  thus, an organization could include only its physician groups in its aco contract and lower its downside risk without changing its assigned population or its de facto governance (because of the common ownership or mutual interests shared by the health system and the physician groups).\n 18\n discourage a key strategy taken by acos\u00e2\u0080\u0094steering volume to more efficient providers and formalizing preferences with inclusion in contracts. we note that many acos with hospitals in participant lists are actually independent physician groups, and we categorized them as such in our evaluations.  these acos should be regarded as low-revenue to encourage their participation, but the proposed use of aco participant lists could categorize them as high- revenue, incentivizing them to drop such partnerships.  this could thwart healthy competition if such acos are able to get specialists and hospitals to compete on quality and efficiency for inclusion in aco contracts.\n therefore, we recommend using additional data sources, such as irs filings and pecos data, to determine the full organizational structure of the core practices that account for the bulk of the assigned population, and to use all tins and ccns in the full organization to determine organizational revenue.  we understand that pecos data are used to validate tins and ccns in aco participant lists, but these data can be additionally used by cms to determine the full organization to which aco participants belong.  in other work funded by the ahrq, we (a team of investigators at hms and the nber) have used these data sources to group independently billing tins and ccns into organizations or systems.  thus, although what we are suggesting would require some additional effort, we believe it would be feasible and would grow easier over time as such enhancements are made.  we would be happy to discuss with cms our experience in coalescing tins and ccns into organizations using these data sources.\n finally, we want to emphasize that we are recommending that revenue determinations be based ideally on the full organizational structure of the core practices that determine attribution.  if an aco includes physician groups that are part of a large health system, that aco should be considered high-revenue whether or not the other parts of the health system are included as participants.  if an aco includes physician groups that are financially independent of hospitals, that aco should be considered low-revenue (unless it is very specialty-heavy or has substantial market share), whether or not preferred hospital partners are included in the contracts.  that way, consolidation in provider markets is discouraged with more downside-risk in aco contracts, and partnerships or preferred networks that can support competition and do not cause commercial mark-ups are not discouraged.  the proposed use of only aco participant lists for revenue determinations could constitute a lost opportunity for discouraging price-increasing consolidation.\n strategies for addressing inadequate risk adjustment we agree with the proposed changes to account for increases in aco population risk scores and to implement measures to limit rewards for increases in coding intensity.  we do not, however, understand the rationale for limiting benchmark decreases to reflect decreases in risk scores.  capping downward adjustments for changes in patient risk introduces strong incentives for acos to engage in favorable risk selection (i.e., cream-skimming).\n 19\n resources available for quality improvement.  in particular, the aco cahps data, which include several measures of self-reported health and functional limitations, can be used to determine the extent to which increases in hcc scores reflect changes in coding vs. changes in health status.  discrepancies between the two could be used to limit benchmark increases due to coding increases in a more refined, aco-specific manner.  such adjustments could be instituted after an initial grace period (e.g., 3 years) that would permit coding increases that are unrelated to health status changes since they might reflect efforts by under-coding acos to achieve accurate coding. differences in spending predicted by hcc scores vs. cahps variables could also be used to identify acos that are undercoding relative to others at baseline and that should therefore be eligible for such a grace period.\n some of the clinical and social characteristics included in the cahps survey could also be used to further risk adjust aco benchmarks, and this information has been found to explain a meaningful amount of variation in aco spending after controlling for hcc score.29  we would caution, however, against adjustments for time-varying health status variables, as adjusting for health status weakens incentives for acos to improve patient health.\n an advantage of using acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 historical spending as the basis for benchmarks is that historical spending accounts for all differences in patient population risk between acos, whether measurable or not.  blending benchmarks with regional average makes program success depend heavily on risk adjustment for observable patient factors.  in the context of inadequate risk adjustment, regionally adjusted benchmarks would cause unjustified financial transfers from acos serving sicker and poorer patients to those serving healthier and wealthier patients.  unfortunately, risk adjustment will always be inadequate because all differences between patient populations can never be fully accounted for, particularly with available data sources.  it is not a question of whether risk adjustment is inadequate but the extent of its inadequacy.\n accordingly, in the future, should benchmarks be converged toward a regional average (again, we strongly recommend against regional adjustments at this juncture), we would urge cms to implement additional measures to ensure that acos are not penalized for serving higher-risk patients, independent of their efficiency or quality of care.  for example, an additional adjustment could take the form of a per-beneficiary care management fee that is higher for higher-risk patients, as in the comprehensive primary care plus program. to keep such a measure budget neutral and further encourage participation in the mssp, a small discount could be applied to ffs rates paid to all providers and redistributed as care management fees to acos, with higher payments to acos serving higher-risk patients regardless of their performance.  alternatively, aco benchmarks could simply be adjusted upward or downward by an additional amount (i.e., beyond adjustments for patient factors included in the risk-adjustment methodology) depending on whether their populations are higher- or lower-risk, respectively, than the regional average.\n finally, we are concerned that the proposed structure of the beneficiary incentive program could exacerbate favorable risk selection in the mssp.  specifically, because an aco must\n 20\n bear the costs of the incentive payments and because an aco must furnish an incentive payment to an eligible beneficiary each time the beneficiary receives a qualifying service (in accordance with section 1899(m)(2)(d)(iv) of the bipartisan budget act), the costs to an aco of serving higher-risk patients will be greater than the costs of serving lower-risk patients (since higher-risk patients use more services).  for this reason, we believe it is important for beneficiary incentive programs to be optional (as proposed), expect few acos to establish one, and do not expect the opportunity to establish one will attract acos into downside risk tracks.  we recommend close monitoring of acos that do implement beneficiary incentive programs.\n in general, we are in favor of patients sharing in the savings generated by their aco, whether in the form of direct payments, lower premiums, or in-kind benefits.  in the future, once more convergence in spending has occurred and benchmarks reliably reward more efficient providers, such mechanisms for sharing savings with beneficiaries could help to make more efficient providers more attractive to beneficiaries and foster competition to achieve savings (to compete for patients), as long as the benefits to beneficiaries are greater when aco savings are greater.  currently, linking the size of beneficiary payments to aco savings would tend to make the least efficient providers more attractive to beneficiaries since those providers are generating the most savings and would offer greater benefits. therefore, we agree with not establishing that link for now but believe it is worth revisiting once more convergence in spending occurs.  at that point, mechanisms to share savings with beneficiaries also could be used to mitigate incentives for acos to select low-risk patients by stipulating that higher-risk patients receive more of the savings than lower-risk patients.  acos engaging in favorable risk selection to generate savings would then become more attractive to the patients they may be trying to avoid.  we understand that the bipartisan budget act currently prohibits unequal payments to different beneficiaries.  we are suggesting this potential policy direction for future consideration.\n recommendation 7: eliminate cap on downward benchmark adjustments that result from decreases in risk scores to mitigate what would otherwise be strong incentives to engage in favorable risk selection. use aco cahps data to help distinguish between changes in coding intensity and changes in population health status.  should benchmarks be converged to a regional average in the future (not in the near term per recommendation 4), implement additional payments or benchmark adjustments so that acos are not penalized for serving higher-risk patients.\n 21\n for regional trend assessment. but small sample sizes can be handled easily with hierarchical statistical modeling approaches. the second is that aco populations may differ markedly from non-aco populations and thus have distinct expected spending trends.  but research to date has found that aco and non-aco populations are largely similar, on average.  moreover, this concerned is best addressed with rigorous risk adjustment of benchmark updates for an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population risk, as risk adjustment will not diminish incentives to save.  the third is that removing an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population will strengthen incentives for acos to select patients with favorable risks.  we believe this, too, is most appropriately addressed with risk adjustment.  no matter the updating methodology, acos will have incentives to select patients that are lower-risk in ways that are not accounted for by the risk adjustment methodology.  as we discuss above, we believe the risk adjustment methodology can be improved and additional steps can be taken to minimize incentives for favorable risk selection.\n therefore, we recommend removing an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed population from update determinations.  we generally agree with the proposed blending of concurrent national and regional growth rates to update benchmarks, with greater weight given to national growth rates for acos in areas where the ffs population served by other providers is limited.  but rather than use an arbitrary weighting scheme, we recommend the use of standard statistical approaches to estimation that account for random error from finite sample sizes. such methods are used, for example, to estimate excess readmission rates for the hospital readmissions reduction program.  specifically, at the end of each performance year, cms analysts could use claims data from the performance year and baseline year 3 (by3) to fit a simple multilevel model of total medicare spending per beneficiary as a function of county- level random intercepts and (time) slopes, excluding beneficiaries attributed to the aco of interest (the model would be estimated separately to determine each aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s update).  with empirical bayes estimation, the model will produce estimates of county-level spending trends that are shrunken toward the national trend when a county\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sample is small (whether because the county is small or because a large proportion of its population is served by the aco) and closer to the unshrunken county trend when the population in the county not assigned to the aco is large. for each aco, a weighted average of the estimated (shrunken) county trends can then be taken (reflecting the geographic distribution of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed patients) to arrive at the benchmark update for that aco.\n this approach would preserve incentives for acos to lower spending by removing their assigned population from update determinations while incorporating regional trends to the extent they can be reliably estimated and flexibly giving more weight to the national trend for acos that serve higher proportions of their service area.  we believe it is important initially to incorporate regional trend information to the extent possible because it is important initially to align benchmarks with acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 counterfactual spending to engender trust that acos will be rewarded for improvement.  after acos have had a few years to lower spending, benchmarks may later diverge from counterfactual spending without reactionary participation losses, as long as the divergence does not depend on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past performance, as discussed above.  this method achieves the goal of incorporating regional trends to the extent it can be reliably supported by the data.\n 22\n by including the rest of the aco population in update determinations (all but those assigned to the aco of interest), this approach to benchmark updating will still apply downward pressure on aco benchmarks at a rate that follows, but is less than, the rate of slowing in spending caused by the program.  thus, rebasing is not necessary to exert this downward pressure.  including the rest of the aco population in update determination will also introduce an element of competition in markets with multiple acos, as acos will be rewarded more if they lower spending more than their competitors.  this dynamic may become undesirably prominent in large service areas dominated by multiple acos.  in such markets, the weight given to the national trend will be limited because the market is large (allowing stable trend estimation), so that the update for an aco will be based almost entirely on the performance of its neighboring aco competitors.  thus, if all acos lower spending significantly and equally, none would be rewarded for doing so.  such cases are not currently common.  a more common scenario is the single aco dominating a small market.  for those cases, our recommended methodology would rely on national trends for updates.  but cms could monitor for cases of high aco penetration in large markets with multiple acos and use national trends for those markets, too.\n more generally, should the mssp expand to the point that the national non-aco population becomes small, we would recommend choosing a desirable rate at which benchmarks should grow and apply that rate to all acos.  the methodology we describe above is best suited to an expansion phase of the program.\n recommendation 8: remove an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed population from benchmark update determinations to preserve incentives for acos to lower spending. use multilevel statistical modeling approaches to estimate aco-specific update factors that reflect regional and national trends, with greater weight placed on national trends for aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that serve higher proportions of patients in their service area.  after a phase of program expansion, switch to using a desirable preset rate of benchmark growth applied to all acos.\n thank you for your consideration of our comments.  if you should wish to discuss any of our analyses or recommendations further, you can reach us

its august 9 proposed rule on the medicare shared savings aco program.\n\n | currently lead a track 1+ mssp aco, called north central arizona accountable care, llc, which started in january 2015. we are located in central arizona and have approximately 14,500 medicare beneficiaries.\n\n as you are aware, on august 9, 2018, cms released a proposed rule that would set a new direction for the mssp, referred to as the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3pathways to success\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 program. the proposal would improve the existing mssp in a number of ways, including:\n\n e lengthens agreement periods from three years to five years, promoting program stability; e ramps up risk more gradually for \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3basic\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 track acos;\n e provides an additional six to 18 months in a shared savings only model for 82 current acos that would otherwise be required to move to risk on january 1, 2019, if renewing participation;\n e makes basic level e (track 1+ equivalent) permanent; \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e3\u00b3 includes implementation of aco-specific payment rule waivers and beneficiary incentives;\n e provides flexibility to acos by allowing them to choose assignment annually regardless of risk-based status;\n e replaces the certified electronic health record technology (cehrt) use measure with attestation; and\n e adding waivers to the program.\n\n | agree that these are all significant improvements to the aco program. we do, however, have some significant concerns with the proposed rule, as | will identify below.\n\n areas of concern\n e shortening the time that acos have to take on downside financial risk, which will deter new entrants and drive existing acos to leave the program. the proposed rule reduces the onramp to taking on downside financial risk for new acos from six to only two years. based on a naacos survey conducted earlier this year, this will likely result in more than 70 percent of early acos leaving the program. further, research, including the hhs inspector general\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s, shows that it typically takes more than two years for acos to make the clinical and operational changes to prepare successfully for financial risk.\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e3\u00b3 cutting shared savings from 50 to 25 percent, which will deter new entrants. the proposed rule cuts shared savings in half for shared savings-only acos, severely undermining the business case to join the pathways to success program and begin the transition to value-based payment for new acos. acos are investing millions of dollars of their own capital to improve care; cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed reduction of the shared savings rate will preclude acos from generating a return on investment. closing off the pipeline of new acos will significantly hamper the overall shift to value-based payment.\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e3\u00b3 changing the regional benchmarking may deter new entrants and drive existing acos to leave the program. regions that have lower benchmarks (and typically lower costs/spend) are unfairly offset by the regions whereby benchmarks and cost/spend is much, much higher. this makes it extremely difficult for aco in regions with lower benchmarking to compete when the standard or baseline is significantly higher. in other words, in regions where spend and benchmarks are low, there is less opportunity to reduce costs and increase savings for cms. what would be the incentive for acos to participate in ssp in low-cost, low-spend regions? (for example, how does an acos with an $8000 benchmark complete [for shared savings] with an aco with a $25,000 benchmark?) there is significant investment in aco start-up and operations, so there would be little, if anything, to offset the costs of starting and/or maintaining an aco.\n\n e lack of transparency in benchmarking may deter new entrants and drive existing acos to leave the program. while the proposed rule states that the benchmarking would be overhauled to depict a more accurate representation of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s costs (regional or national service areas) there is little transparency in the methodology. transparency of the current methodology would allow acos to perform enhanced analytics and better forecast future savings/costs.\n\n e existing benchmarking adjustments/readjustments may deter new entrants and drive existing acos to leave the program. the current benchmarking adjustments do not keep current with the changes in acuity and health status of patients. the annual update to historical benchmark does not take into consideration disease progression and/or unforeseen circumstances or changes in health status and/or acuity. an increase in adjustment frequency would assist acos in being more successful.\n\n e include and recognize of all chronic conditions within cms-hcc risk adjustment model so all costs of chronic conditions are factored into cost and utilization of services. for example, cms-hcc does not\n risk adjust for chronic ischemic heart disease (without angina pectoris); yet, chronic ischemic vascular disease of the brain (i.e. cerebrovascular disease) and extremities (i.e. peripheral vascular disease) are recognized and risk adjusted as chronic conditions. ischemic heart (or coronary artery) disease remains the leading cause of death in the united states, but is not accounted for in risk scoring without accompanying angina. individuals with heart disease (with or without angina) have to be chronically managed and need the resources to do so...\n\n given the significant negative impact presented by the areas of concern above, naacos strongly urges cms to modify the above two provisions to: 1) increase the permitted time in basic levels a and b to at least three years and for acos that meet certain quality and cost standards allow additional years; 2) rescind the proposed decrease in shared savings and retain the existing 50 percent shared savings rate for shared savings only and low risk acos; 3) do not make changes to the regional benchmarking; 4) increase transparency in benchmarking; 5) increase frequency of benchmarking\n t t/readjust t; and 6) include/recognize all chronic conditions in the cms-hcc risk\n adjustment model.\n thank you for your time and consideration to our comments.\n\n sincerely,\n ami giardina\n\n", "0015": "as you know, under the current medicare shared savings program (mssp) beneficiary assignment regulations, an np is an

effective behavioral health assessment tools, the vast majority of people with mental health conditions go unidentified in primary care settings. that lack of identification and treatment in most cases leads to higher total medical costs and non-adherent patients.\r\n\r\nadditionally, failure to diagnose and effectively manage/treat patients in many cases results in increased risk of suicidality and addiction.\r\n\r\nthe use of validated assessment tools and integrated care can make acos far more clinically effective and financially sound.\r\n\r\nbehavior health is central to the development, prevention, treatment, and management of the preventable manifestations of diseases and health conditions (heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, unintentional injuries, pneumonia and influenza, diabetes, suicide, kidney diseases, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, hiv/aids) on which the u.s. spends about $1.5 trillion, 75% of our annual healthcare costs. 1\r\n\r\nthe connection between behavior and physical health is clear. it includes both behavioral risk factors (like smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity), behavioral interventions like stress management, behavioral sleep management, behavioral pain management, and psychological interventions addressing quality of life. people with common physical health conditions (diabetes, cardiac, obesity, etc.) have higher rates of mental health issues, with unipolar depression being the 2nd largest contributor to disease burden in countries like the u.s. more than heart disease, alcohol use, and traffic accidents. primary care settings provide about half of all mental health care for common psychiatric disorders. unfortunately, medical providers often lack the time or training to help patients manage behavioral health problems in evidence-based ways beside offering prescriptions for medication.\r\n\r\nwhat is integrated behavioral health care?\r\n\r\nbroadly, integrated behavioral health care can be described as any situation in which behavioral health and medical providers work collaboratively. also termed; integrated health, co-coordinated care, seamless care, comprehensive care, or integrated primary care, this approach comes in a number of models, varying in level of integration and dependent upon the resources of the health care practice or system.\r\n\r\nwhen behavioral health practitioners, such as health psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, clinical social workers, or health coaches are integrated into the medical setting, whether in-person or virtually, they are able to assess the global health of the patient and work cooperatively with the medical provider; truly providing patient-centered and comprehensive health care. according to cj peek and the national integration academy councils lexicon for behavioral health and primary care (2013),\r\nintegrated primary care is the care that results from a practice team of primary care and behavioral health clinicians, working together with patients and families, using a systematic and cost-effective approach to provide patient-centered care for a defined population. this care may address mental health and substance abuse conditions, health behaviors (including their contribution to chronic medical illnesses), life stressors and crises, stress-related physical symptoms, and ineffective patterns of health care utilization.\r\nultimately, early assessment and treatment of behavioral health issues leads to better outcomes for both mental and physical health while decreasing total cost of care.\r\n\r\n1.agency for healthcare research and quality: https://integrationacademy.ahrq.gov\r\n\r\n9/24/18 submitted by stuart segal on behalf of tridiuum, inc

nasa during the apollo missions and paraphrased from an interview with jerry bostick fdo flight controller. it became a title to a book and a documentary.\r\n\r\ncms is now confronted with a similarly dire circumstance. the medicare trust fund is forecast to run out on 2026. the medicare budget expands by $135 million per day. a simply staggering amount. an interesting context is use this metric for context. it seems to link the time we have left with the impact of the program to date. i have converted many of the economic amounts used in the medicare debate to days of medicare budget growth.\r\n\r\nin this days of growth context, the entire savings of the shared savings program to date, under the best-case scenario as recently published by naacos delays the bankruptcy of the medicare trust fund by 2 months. assuming that the nprm does not cause acos to flee and the effort doubles the total savings as a result, the medicare trust fund is saved for another 4 months in the coming six years. a grand total of 6 months. note: this is one year more than the proposed 5 year contract cycle, hence failure is not an option.\r\n\r\nno, this is not a complaint of the ssp, quite the contrary, it is a plaintiff cry to do more, require more of the acos and give them the tools to get the job done - the tools to exercise their accountability. there are two at the top of the list that we have learned from medicare advantage that truly drive beneficiary satisfaction and care transformation.\r\n\r\n1.direct patient engagement in value reduced cost shares/expanded benefits when utilizing the highest performing providers.\r\n2.medical necessity determination allow for challenges of medical necessity, and appeals, will cause all providers in the geography to engage in process and care transformations. monolithic systems will not able to stonewall the innovative.\r\n\r\nmy experience with medicare advantage points to a median medical necessity denial rate at basically 10%, the high being 13% and the low being 6% for any legitimate effort. to put this into context. had the 2017 mssp contractors averaged 10% denial rate, the savings would have been $9.4 billion, or 70 days of medicare budget growth in addition to the savings otherwise achieved. multiplied by six years, the savings is 420 days or well over a full year of spending growth. from a program that currently is accountable for 15% of the beneficiaries. expand the program to 45% and now the ssp is realizing its potential to successfully and meaningfully contribute to transforming the medicare program to one of sustainability.\r\n\r\nwith the tools to engage the patients in value and the delivery system in accountability, the shared savings program could flourish. instead of shrinking, acos would grow the monolithic squatters may temporarily withdraw but couldnt not stay on the sidelines as those systems that embraced these tools would attract the population and the beneficiaries would vote with their feet.\r\n\r\nchange would not be as simple as i have outlined here and would be initially slower, but there are also many more savings to the trust fund that accrue from a much stronger program as the beneficiaries voted with their feet on both quality and cost, when delivery systems meet the demand for improvement with innovation vs. insulation.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n

efforts to redesign the mssp tracks and limit access to one-sided risk accountable care organizations (acos). the aan recommends that cms slow the pace of regulatory change to the aco program and reassess proposals that would limit neurologist participation in acos.\n\n the aan strongly opposes cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to redesign the mssp tracks and limit aco participation in one-sided risk models to just two years. the aan urges cms, at a minimum, to maintain the availability of one-sided risk models in the mssp to two three-year agreement periods. acos need enough time to optimize processes in the early stages of their development and should not be expected to prematurely take on downside risk before they are ready. this idea is supported by the data. a recent study published by avalere health indicated that the costliest acos are new acos and that acos tend to generate savings over time.' notably, acos generated a net savings after their fourth year in the mssp,\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 indicating that cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed two-year limit is an unrealistic\n\n\n ' seidman, josh, et al.

problematic for providers in rural areas and safety-net organizations, for whom patients are generally more vulnerable and harder to effectively manage.\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s program data provides further evidence supporting the value of one-sided risk acos. in 2017, after accounting for shared savings payments, one-sided risk acos saved the medicare program $291 million.* contrary to the premise underlying cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to limit one-sided risk models, this data shows that one-sided risk acos were the largest generators of savings from the mssp in 2017. given this data, the aan is troubled by the projected negative impact that cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal would have on aco availability. by cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own analysis, more than 100 acos are expected to drop out of the mssp in the next ten years if the proposed redesign is implemented. furthermore, the aan believes the proposal to limit gain-sharing to 25%, down from 50%, for acos participating in one-sided risk models will compound the detrimental impact of compelling acos to prematurely assuming downside risk. the combined effect of the proposed limitations on gain-sharing and on one-sided risk models disincentivizes new market entry and could allow established acos to grow to dominate their regions, creating new market oligopolies.\n\n moreover, the aan is troubled by cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s deliberate effort to decrease the availability of acos, as acos are one of the few alternative payment models (apms) that are currently available for neurologist participation. neurologists should have the opportunity to participate in the american medical system as it evolves toward value-based care through advanced apms and mips apms. neurologists need more opportunities to participate in alternative payment models, but the current proposal will result in fewer opportunities for neurologists to participate in the transition to value-based care. the aan finds cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal especially concerning given the secretary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s general rejection of the apms recommended by the physician-focused payment model technical advisory committee (ptac).\n\n given the demonstrated value of one-sided risk acos and the limited availability of apms to neurologists, the aan strongly believe that cms should permit alternative payment model (apm) entities to take on less financial risk to qualify as an advanced apm. we encourage cms to study the potential for certain aco models with one-sided risk to qualify as advanced apms.\n inclusion of these models as advanced apms would make aco participation more attractive to physicians and is preferable to advancing proposals that would limit aco participation.\n\n additionally, the aan urges cms to slow the pace of change to the mssp regulations. acos have become remarkably complex in a short period of time. early adopters of the mssp have expressed dissatisfaction with cms repeatedly changing the program requirements and structure.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 the rate of change has been especially problematic for rural and small health systems, who continue to have difficulty with the regulatory burden associated with continuous changes to the mssp. the aan recommends that cms provide acos with regulatory relief by postponing efforts to substantially change the currently available aco tracks.\n\n although the aan is concerned with the pace of change to the mssp and the proposed redesign, the aan believes that there are several beneficial ideas contained in the proposed rule. the aan applauds cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to recognize the value that neurologists and other specialists provide\n\n\n 32017 shared savings program (ssp) accountable care organizations (aco)

step towards recognizing that for a subset of patients, neurologists are primary care providers. the aan also supports the adjustments to the benchmarking methodology that can lead to more accurate determinations of savings and losses. this proposal will help to encourage high performing acos to remain in the program and not be forced out due to inaccurate and unfair benchmarks.\n the aan also appreciates cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to allow for additional flexibility in aco beneficiary attribution as it will allow acos to better plan and design care management

harder to effectively manage.\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s program data provides further evidence supporting the value of one-sided risk acos. in 2017, after accounting for shared savings payments, one-sided risk acos saved the medicare program $291 million.* contrary to the premise underlying cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to limit one-sided risk models, this data shows that one-sided risk acos were the largest generators of savings from the mssp in 2017. given this data, the aan is troubled by the projected negative impact that cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal would have on aco availability. by cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own analysis, more than 100 acos are expected to drop out of the mssp in the next ten years if the proposed redesign is implemented. furthermore, the aan believes the proposal to limit gain-sharing to 25%, down from 50%, for acos participating in one-sided risk models will compound the detrimental impact of compelling acos to prematurely assuming downside risk. the combined effect of the proposed limitations on gain-sharing and on one-sided risk models disincentivizes new market entry and could allow established acos to grow to dominate their regions, creating new market oligopolies.\n\n moreover, the aan is troubled by cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s deliberate effort to decrease the availability of acos, as acos are one of the few alternative payment models (apms) that are currently available for neurologist participation. neurologists should have the opportunity to participate in the american medical system as it evolves toward value-based care through advanced apms and mips apms. neurologists need more opportunities to participate in alternative payment models, but the current proposal will result in fewer opportunities for neurologists to participate in the transition to value-based care. the aan finds cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal especially concerning given the secretary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s general rejection of the apms recommended by the physician-focused payment model technical advisory committee (ptac).\n\n given the demonstrated value of one-sided risk acos and the limited availability of apms to neurologists, the aan strongly believe that cms should permit alternative payment model (apm) entities to take on less financial risk to qualify as an advanced apm. we encourage cms to study the potential for certain aco models with one-sided risk to qualify as advanced apms.\n inclusion of these models as advanced apms would make aco participation more attractive to physicians and is preferable to advancing proposals that would limit aco participation.\n\n additionally, the aan urges cms to slow the pace of change to the mssp regulations. acos have become remarkably complex in a short period of time. early adopters of the mssp have expressed dissatisfaction with cms repeatedly changing the program requirements and structure.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 the rate of change has been especially problematic for rural and small health systems, who continue to have difficulty with the regulatory burden associated with continuous changes to the mssp. the aan recommends that cms provide acos with regulatory relief by postponing efforts to substantially change the currently available aco tracks.\n\n although the aan is concerned with the pace of change to the mssp and the proposed redesign, the aan believes that there are several beneficial ideas contained in the proposed rule. the aan applauds cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to recognize the value that neurologists and other specialists

a practitioner as their primary care provider, regardless of specialty, is an important step towards recognizing that for a subset of patients, neurologists are primary care providers. the aan also supports the adjustments to the benchmarking methodology that can lead to more accurate determinations of savings and losses. this proposal will help to encourage high performing acos to remain in the program and not be forced out due to inaccurate and unfair benchmarks.\n the aan also appreciates cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to allow for additional flexibility in aco

participated in an aco. unfortunately, this legislation has excluded nurse practitioners who own a private practice from participating as an aco. the language currently only includes physicians. this language is outdated and is out of alignment with the current national trend in rural healthcare. there are now 22 states in the u.s., district of columbia and guam that have granted full practice authority to nurse practitioners. this has increased access to a primary care provider for americans living in rural areas. nurse practitioners now account for 1 in 4 medical care providers in u.s. rural practices. that is a 43.2 % increase from 2008-2016 (jaspen, 20016). there are 248,000 nurse practitioners in the united states and 77.8% of them are providing primary care. furthermore, 84.9% of nps are accepting medicare patients (np fact, 2018). currently, those patients who see a nurse practitioner in a privately owned practice or clinic cannot be included in the aco numbers. nurse practitioners have also been part of federal and state initiatives to help combat the opioid epidemic and care for patients with addiction. nurse practitioners are permitted to treat addiction patients and prescribe medication assisted therapy (mat) as part of the efforts to end the opioid crisis. this also aligns with the goal of this policy to combat opioid addiction. i am proposing that the law should be changed to include language that private np led practices and np led clinics can be counted as an aco. medicare patients who assign a nurse practitioner as their primary care

initiatives, ehealth, quality, rural health, telehealth\n share\n the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) has launched the agency\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first rural health strategy to help improve access to high quality, affordable healthcare in rural communities. the strategy is intended to provide a proactive and strategic focus on healthcare issues across rural america to ensure the nearly one in five individuals who live in these areas have access to care that meets their needs.\n\n cms is organizing and focusing its efforts to apply a rural lens to the vision and work of the agency. the cms rural health strategy supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 goal of putting patients first. through its implementation and continued stakeholder engagement, this initiative will enhance the positive impacts cms policies have on beneficiaries who live in rural, underserved areas. this administration understands that one of the keys to ensuring that those who call rural america home are able to achieve their highest level of health is to advance policies and programs that address their unique healthcare needs.\n\n background\n approximately 60 million people live in rural areas across the united states \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 including millions of medicare and medicaid beneficiaries. cms recognizes the many obstacles that rural americans face when accessing healthcare services, including a fragmented healthcare delivery system, stretched and diminishing rural health workforce, unaffordability of insurance, and lack of access to specialty services and providers. cms developed this strategy to focus on areas where the\n https://www.cms.gov/| /fact-sheets/ rural-health-strategy 116\n 10/4/2018 cms rural health strategy | cms agency can better serve individuals in rural areas and work to avoid unintended consequences of policy and program implementation for these communities.\n\n summary\n the new strategy announced today builds on several overarching cms priorities launched by the trump administration, including reducing regulatory burdens and empowering patients and providers to make more informed decisions about their healthcare. in addition, the cms rural health strategy underscores cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 commitment to combat our nation\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s opioid epidemic given its disproportionate impact on rural communities.\n\n the cms rural health council -- an agency-wide panel of experts formed in 2016 -- developed the cms rural health strategy with input from 14 listening sessions with rural health care providers, consumers, and other stakeholders. the council gathered real world evidence on the challenges and local solutions associated with providing high quality healthcare in rural communities to inform the development of a strategic plan to improve healthcare in rural america.\n\n representing an agency-wide mindset, the strategy aligns with goals of is the approaches the health resources and services administration\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s (hrsa) federal office of rural health policy (forhp), which was created in 1987 to advise the secretary of the u.s. department of health and human services on healthcare issues impacting rural communities, including:\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd access to quality healthcare and health professionals;\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e3\u00b3 viability of rural hospitals; and\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd effect of the department\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed rules and regulations, including policies under medicare and medicaid, on access to and financing of healthcare in rural areas.\n\n the cms rural health strategy identifies five specific objectives intended to achieve the agency\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s vision for equitable rural health:\n\n\n1. apply a rural lens to cms programs and policies\n\n cms recognizes the need to look at policymaking, program design, and strategic planning through a specific lens to promote health equity among all populations that it serves. the first objective focuses on areas where the agency can better meet the needs of rural populations and avoid unintended consequences of policy and program implementation for these communities. to accomplish this, cms will:\n\n i\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u00a9\u00e2\u00bc.\n\n https://www.cms.gov/ t-sheets/ rural-health-strategy 216\n 10/4/2018 cms rural health strategy | cms \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd apply a newly-developed checklist to relevant policies, procedures, and initiatives that impact rural communities; and \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd identify and accelerate evidence-based practices to improve access to services and providers in rural communities.\n\n\n2. improve access to care through provider engagement and support\n the second strategic objective is to improve access to care through provider engagement and support. this objective focuses on:\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd maximizing scope of practice;\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd providing technical assistance to health care providers to ensure that they can fully participate in cms programs; and\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00bd identifying new ways to overcome patient barriers to access, such as a lack of transportation.\n\n\n3. advance telehealth and telemedicine\n\n the third objective focuses on the advancement of telehealth and telemedicine. telehealth has been proven to be a successful tool to improve access to care and help meet the needs of rural areas that lack sufficient health care services. to help promote the use of telehealth, cms will seek to reduce barriers stakeholders identified such as reimbursement, cross-state licensure issues, and the administrative and financial burden to implement telemedicine.\n\n\n4. empower patients in rural communities to make decisions about\n their health care\n cms will leverage existing rural communication networks to empower patients with the information and tools to engage in their health care and will explore ways to support enhanced access through the use of health information technology (health it). cms will work to ensure information is reaching rural beneficiaries by:\n\n collaborating with rural communication networks to develop and disseminate easy-to-understand materials;\n supporting the adoption of health it and the development of infrastructure to enhance patient access to health information; and\n fostering engagement of rural beneficiaries in their health care.\n\n 5, leverage partnerships to achieve the goals of the cms rural health strategy\n a key objective of the strategy is to leverage partnerships with stakeholders nationally, as well as at the regional, state, and local levels.\n to accomplish this, cms will:\n\n https://www.cms.gov/ t-sheets/ rural-health-strategy 3/6\n 10/4/2018 cms rural health strategy | cms\n explore opportunities with the office of the national coordinator for health information technology and other federal partners to promote interoperability of health information and increase the use of electronic health records among individuals and their healthcare providers and care teams.\n\n work with federal and state partners to understand and evaluate the impacts of cms programs on rural communities, and develop recommendations.\n\n meet with health plan representatives to discuss challenges and strategies to increase participation in rural areas.\n work with the centers for disease control and prevention to increase\n the focus on maternal health, behavioral health, substance abuse, and the integration of behavioral health and primary care.\n\n work with state medicaid agencies and other state partners to advance rural health strategies for medicaid eligible individuals, including people with disabilities, dual-eligible beneficiaries, and people with substance use disorders.\n\n cms will continue to collaborate with agency partners across the u.s.\n department of health and human services (hhs), including health resources and services administration\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s (hrsa) federal office of rural health policy, to implement this strategy.\n\n for more information on the cms rural health strategy, please visit:\n

402-826-3746\nserpa-aco, llc\noctober 4, 2018\nwe are pleased to comment on the proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success and how it can negatively affect the 20,000+ medicare patients we care for.\nbackground\nserpa-aco is a track 1 aco that began in 2013 and entered our final year in 2018. initially, we were a group of 9 independent private practice primary care clinics which has expanded to 16 clinics (still independent private primary care practices). our geographic footprint is over 25,000 square miles which means we average less than 1 patient per square mile. we have 8 critical access hospitals (and 4 communities with a sole non critical access hospital community hospital.) each practice has an electronic medical record (emr) but we have 8 different systems in our clinics. we have had savings in one out of the last 3 years but not enough to meet the threshold. in addition, with cms hcc scoring methodology we have been unable to reach shared savings even while actually controlling costs for our patients.\nour dilema\ncms has created the aco silo which continues to change into a better value based system to care for patients. however, it has created a new silo called \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomprehensive primary care plus\u00e2\u0080\u009d which cannot work with the acos in the same geographic footprint. with the inability to share program elements, these each become silos. in addition, cms has maintained the critical access hospital silos across our geographic area. as important as they may be to rural health care, they have no \u00e2\u0080\u009cskin in the game\u00e2\u0080\u009d when it comes to saving money for medicare. they bill and are reimbursed for allowable expenses whether their census is 1 or 21. the more expense they can justify, the more they are paid by the medicare trust fund. without the ability to have control of the critical access hospital costs, the aco clinics have no way to effectively bend the cost curve in their communities without depriving medicare beneficiaries and other patients of needed medical care. in addition, our sole community hospitals have no real incentive or competition that will force them to look at their costs as a part of the total cost of caring for our patients.\neffects of the medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success proposed rule\nregional benchmarking: while in theory this makes sense, many of our rural clinics end up being their own region. that means they are competing against themselves and they quickly arrive at limit of what they can control. patients still get sick, still have needed care and under the mssp model, have sometimes incurred added costs early in the program through needed preventative services that have not yet shown the effect of decreasing costs (i.e. costs related to increased frequency of mammography, will not show evidence of decreased costs related to treatment of breast cancer for several years.)  so, there will not be evidence of savings for several years after a preventative program(s) implementation.\ncontract terms: serpa-aco readily accepts the desire of cms to enter into longer contract terms to \u00e2\u0080\u009cencourage stability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  however, cms seems to regularly change the rules, re-write the rules or \u00e2\u0080\u009cclarify\u00e2\u0080\u009d the rules. this means that there is no stability to the contract and aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cannot plan any actions based on a reasonable assumption that the contract will remain stable. this only decreases the trust in cms to do what they said they were going to do.\n\npush toward risk taking: serpa-aco understands the need for both upside and downside risk sharing but must be able to control costs and have cost transparency for the tests, procedures, supplies and drugs they order. with the current critical access hospital structure, we cannot have any control of the costs. our clinicians regularly use such guidelines as \u00e2\u0080\u009cchoosing wisely\u00e2\u0080\u009d to provide guidance for what they do but patients still do require minimum tests to help establish a diagnosis and determine a treatment plan. when there is little transparency and limited options without extended travel, it is impossible to realistically accept downside risk. upside risk will only change with the allowance of time to see the economic results of preventative services and with regional benchmarking the ability to stay ahead of our cost basis is severely limited.\nhcc scoring and risk adjustment payments: under the current fee-for-service payment system using e/m coding, there was no incentive for clinicians to use more than a diagnosis which would justify the service provided. with the change to hcc scoring and providing value based services, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cother\u00e2\u0080\u009d diagnoses which the clinician considered but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always put into the assessment of a patient and their condition suddenly became important. our clinicians have worked hard to accurately reflect the patient and their justifiable conditions in the coding they provided. this, of course, raises the hcc score. the end result is that cms rules placed a cap on the amount the hcc score could increase in a given year.  the clinics that are beginning to understand the value-based care model are severely punished by the cms cap on the annual increase in the hcc score.  the assumption that this was done to \u00e2\u0080\u009cgame the system\u00e2\u0080\u009d does not even begin to take into consideration that physicians were able to show the true picture of the patients they were seeing and the necessary considerations to form a diagnosis and treatment plan.  with the proposal to allow only a 3 percent change based on hcc coding and quality measure over 5 years, this eliminates the need to continue to improve hcc coding to reflect the actual condition of the patient.\nassignment methodologies: serpa-aco agrees with the opportunity for patients to choose and establish a medical home with their clinician. however, in much of our rural area, the patient does not have options. in addition, the current medicare fee-for-service system and the burden of government regulation impacts the ability of the patient to even find a clinician who will see them under medicare. we appreciate knowing who claims to be the patient of a specific clinician and it gives us opportunity to begin to monitor their care and the costs incurred but the current cms reporting by being at least 90 days after the service is provided does not allow us to effectively make changes or take steps to help control costs to the trust fund.\npayment rule waivers: serpa-aco is pleased that cms intends to change the 3 day snf rule which has been a drain to the trust fund for a number of years. for many of our communities, however, there may be only swing beds at a critical access hospital or a single skilled nursing facility community provider. while it may lower the costs related to a critical access hospital hospitalization, there is no incentive for an increase in transparency by the critical access hospital swing bed nor a reason that the skilled nursing facility community provider has an interest in decreasing their length of stay. these factors in rural communities where competitive contracting is not available, make it unlikely to see any significant savings.\ntelehealth may have advantages for specialty care, particularly those specialties where \u00e2\u0080\u009chands on\u00e2\u0080\u009d care is neither required nor expected. however, in our rural service area, internet is often not available or not reliable in terms of connectivity or bandwidth to make it practical to use. many of our patients who are older and have more health issues do not have the capability or the motivation to use electronic means of communication. this limits its practical use in our patient population.\nbeneficiary incentive programs also have significant limitations where the long distances to care make it more difficult to connect the patient to the care they need. a hundred mile one way trip (200 miles total) trip will not be adequately reimbursed by a $20 gift card for fuel. the added documentation requirements, and direct to patient provisions, make it not likely to be of benefit to a rural aco.\noverall impression of the proposed rule: serpa-aco is in favor of anything that pushes forward the concepts of value based care and benefits the patient without adding to the costs to the trust fund. however, we feel that many of the proposed rule changes will make it more difficult for our rural based clinicians to participate in the program as proposed. with the addition of the cpc+ silo and the continuation of the critical access hospital silo, there is a lower incentive to make the aco mssp program work. the added documentation, the lowered allowances for change in risk adjustment, and the forced downside risk requirements without the ability to exert any control in the external costs, all make participation in any type of mssp less of a viable option for a rural aco.\nsincerely,\njoleen huneke\t\t\t\tdale michels, md\njoleen huneke\t\t\t\t\tdale michels, md\nceo\t\t\t\t\t\tcmo\n\n\n", "0141": "as you know,

voice my support for some of the proposed rules as outlined under file code cms-1701-p, the centers for medicare medicaid services (cms) proposed rule: medicare program: medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success. specifically i support the proposals that would increase access and assist with care coordination through payments for telehealth services. this benefit would specifically help those who are home bound, or lack transportation, to have access to primary care services that would otherwise be unavailable. i am also in support of the aspects of the rule that promote ehr communication between providers and suppliers, as well as improved opioid use communication between providers, which may help curb opioid abuse and addiction.\ni would however like to express my disappointment that advanced practice nurses are still largely being left out of the discussion. the proposed rule document speaks mainly to physicians, and only vaguely seems to refer to other \u00e2\u0080\u009cproviders\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a few instances. in contrast, there are many specific references to physicians noted. along the same lines, but arguably more important remains the fact that non-physician providers are still reimbursed at a lower rate than physicians by medicare, medicaid, and most third party payers. this is despite the growing evidence that nurse practitioners provide care that costs less and that \u00e2\u0080\u009cresults suggest that increasing access to np primary care will not increase costs for the medicare program and may be cost saving\u00e2\u0080\u009d (perloff, desroches, buerhaus, 2015). it should also be noted that with the increased complexity of medicare and medicaid reimbursement, as evidenced by this rather wordy and lengthy document, there is a growing trend toward a newer model of primary care delivery known as direct primary care (dpc). according to rubin (2018), \u00e2\u0080\u009cby not taking insurance and limiting their panels to only several hundred patients, dpc physicians say they have more time to practice primary care medicine the way it should be practiced, not the way the payers dictate\u00e2\u0080\u009d. the dpc model is becoming especially popular among non-physician primary care providers as well. this is likely because while many states have expanded practice authority for nurse practitioners, medicare and medicaid continue with discriminatory reimbursement practices against them. it is simply not sustainable to open a nurse practitioner practice when billing medicare and medicaid.\ntherefore, i would like to recommend that future proposals be more inclusive of non-physician providers. also, i would argue that proposals be made to increase reimbursement to nurse practitioners to equal that of physicians, as a viable and effective measure to increase access to primary care to those with medicare and medicaid. i appreciate the opportunity to voice my thoughts on this matter and hope you will take some of this information into consideration for future proposals. thank you.\nreferences\nperloff, j., desroches, c. m., buerhaus, p.

cms-1701-p as they relate to beneficiary engagement. specifically, i want to encourage the continued inclusion of the proposal to incentivize beneficiaries to achieve and maintain good health. health behavior change theory generally predicts that up to 20% of at-risk individuals are prepared to initiate beneficial behavior change at any given time (1). health behavior change is difficult, often overwhelming, and typically an up-and-down journey over the course of a lifetime. that being said, the majority of us healthcare dollars are spent on treating chronic conditions and diseases like diabetes, arthritis, and heart disease, which make up 7 of the 10 leading causes of death in our country (2). morbidity, mortality, and costs related to chronic disease are too high compared to peer countries, especially given that many of these conditions are preventable (3). behaviors related to diet and physical activity drive the majority of this crisis (4)(5). thus enabling behavior change on a large-scale is a necessity that we cannot afford to overlook.\r\n\r\naccountable care organizations like those in the mssp are in a unique position to create opportunities for beneficiaries to become aware of and be actively connected to evidence-based behavior change programming. by placing increased accountability on providers and their respective systems to keep beneficiaries healthy before disease or crisis occurs, acos can help move the intervention point of patient care upstream. at-risk individuals are more likely to pursue behavior change when encouraged by their clinician (6)(7), but as many health educators and community-based providers of behavior change programming can attest, the most difficult barrier can be getting a person to commit to the behavior change process after leaving the healthcare providers office. incentivizing behavior change as a series of steps to achieve and maintain good health would help motivate the individual to take action on a challenging process, and give the provider working within the aco a stronger platform on which to advocate that the patient take advantage of behavior change program opportunities outside of the clinical environment, at places implementing evidence-based approaches like the ymca.\r\n\r\none major example is the national diabetes prevention program (dpp). more than one in three us adults (and nearly one in two adults age 65+) have prediabetes and would be eligible for participation in the dpp (8). community-based organizations like the ymca have gone to great lengths to meet the requirements of becoming certified medicare suppliers of the dpp to try and make non-clinical health services accessible to people in the places they live and spend time. while the clinical need for the program is statistically guaranteed to be present in every community, ymcas nationwide face difficulty in getting the volume of dpp participants necessary to fill classes. awareness of personal risk and of opportunities to mitigate risk, and reaching a sufficient readiness-to-change level, are two of the main challenges. giving acos the option to incentivize behavior change such as enrollment in behavior-change programming like dpp would support an infrastructure in which providers are systematically encouraged to partner with community-based services and connect patients to supportive programming outside the clinic, as well as provide another layer of motivation (through incentives) for an at-risk individual to choose to initiate the behavior change process.\r\n\r\n(1)

rule.\r\n\r\nas a way of background, i represent a physician-led aco, finishing up its first agreement period as a track 1 mssp. during the first three years, we have learned much. one of the things we know is that limiting the number of years in a non-risk bearing aco will be detrimental to existing acos and will discourage potential new entrants from joining the program.\r\n\r\nas a small, rural-based, physician-led aco, these three years have been an enormous learning process. due to delayed data, it is very difficult for an aco to make targeted change until nearly half-way through its first year. extending the length of time an aco is eligible to be non-risk bearing does not mean the aco is not working to make changes. our aco, for example, has implemented initiatives to reduce expenditures and our physicians are actively engaged. however, we continue to see in our quarterly reports rising part a expenditures. while we have a physician-owned specialty hospital in our aco, we do not have a community-based hospital and therefore have very little ability to affect costs in the hospital. in addition, because of our rural setting, we also struggle with the cost of critical access hospitals as these hospitals are used on a regular basis and contribute greatly to our expenses.\r\n\r\nthe other area of increasing expenditure is part b drugs. we believe a large contributing factor to this growth is the health systems participation in the 340b program. since our aco began, this line item has increased 82%. again, we have no way to control this cost.\r\n\r\nthese examples are given as a way to show our support for the consideration of low revenue vs. high revenue acos. we believe that small acos in rural areas face challenges that large health systems do not. data shows that physician-led acos are more successful in saving money. we believe we are implementing change that will have an impact, but struggle to show the impact due to costs that are largely out of our control.\r\n\r\nwe also support the reduction in quality reporting measures, as it reduces administrative burden.\r\n\r\nbecause of the time it takes to get the aco operational, we also support the cms proposal to extend the agreement periods to five years; however, we oppose the move from six years in the non-risk track to two years. we also oppose the agencys proposal to cut the shared savings rate from 50% to 25%.\r\n\r\nas our participants are new to the risk adjustment concept, we also urge cms to modify the proposed application of a +/- 3 percent risk adjustment cap across an extended period by increasing that rate to +/- 5 percent.\r\n\r\nbecause of the significant changes proposed to the program, and the lateness of the proposal, we also suggest that the start-date for implementation of pathways to success be moved from july 1, 2019 to january 1, 2020.\r\n\r\nthank you again for your work on behalf of patients and providers to advance value-based payment. we

21244-1850\r\n\r\nre: comments on pathways to success mssp proposed rule\r\ndear administrator verma,\r\naugusta care partners is an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a administrative leader for augusta care partners, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not adequately reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into

proposed rule for 2019 to cms include:\r\n1.our rural aco is a high-quality performer and is saving cms money.\r\n2.the rocky mtn aco is based in rural practices and rural facilities that lack capital reserves and cannot take on risk.\r\n3.the proposed 25% shared savings opportunity is not worth the effort.\r\n4.we should be considered \"low revenue\". our aco is rural and therefore should be considered low revenue.\r\n\r\nnew study released this week confirms mssp acos are generating significant savings for cms.\r\nthe medicare shared savings program (mssp) acos are improving quality and saving medicare significantly more than cms originally calculated. the national association of accountable care organizations (naacos) commissioned dobson davanzo & associates to conduct an independent evaluation of mssp aco cost savings. they found that acos in the mssp generated savings of $1.84b from 2013-2015, nearly double the $954m in savings estimated by cms. after accounting for shared savings bonuses, acos actually saved medicare $541.7m. discussed in todays health affairs blog, the study used a gold standard regression analysis to evaluate the program versus the cms benchmarking methodology used for financial targets and calculating bonuses or penalties.\r\n\r\n2017 mssp aco results\r\nnewly released 2017 mssp results further demonstrated continued savings for cms. using the benchmarking methodology, cms saved $1.1b in 2017 alone, netting just shy of $314m after accounting for shared savings payments earned by acos.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n

success mssp proposed rule\r\ndear administrator verma,\r\naugusta care partners is an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient

important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as an administrative leader supporting our augusta care partners providers, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\n\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\n\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\n\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\n\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\n\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact office workflow and efficiency for our providers. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents our patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to office operations.\r\n\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit the patients served by our aco and allow our aco

communitys accountable care organization, community health provider alliance (chpa), we would like to take this opportunity to express the interest federally qualified health centers (referred to here as fqhcs, or health centers) have in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\n\r\nour aco is a non-profit community-based organization comprised solely of fqhcs in colorado. our health centers are non-profit, community-directed providers that serve as the primary medical home for 790,000 patients in our state, including more than 1 in 7 coloradoans.\r\n\r\nwe welcome the opportunity to respond to cms pathways to success nprm. while we believe the proposed rule includes important steps toward increased success, there are several areas where we raise caution and seek clarification. in summary, our comments will focus on the following areas:\r\nhealth centers are important partners in accountable care arrangements, producing cost savings for the system and enhanced quality of care for beneficiaries and look forward to continuing this work together.\r\ncms should invest in a more gradual pathway to increased levels of financial risk for low-revenue provider-led accountable care organizations (acos), with consideration made to those acos comprised solely of fqhcs.\r\nmany fqhcs, because they provide care to some of the most underserved communities in the country, require additional investment to prepare for two-sided risk arrangements.\r\nincreased flexibility in the ability to provide telehealth services will support health centers participating in the pathways to success program.\r\na more appropriate benchmarking process will support participating health centers in delivering the best care for the vulnerable populations they serve.\r\ncms should be mindful of inadvertently causing cherry-picking of patients by allowing acos to provide beneficiary incentives.\r\n\r\nwe are in opposition to a few key aspects of the recent proposed pathways to success rule, in particular the agency's proposal to cut acos shared savings rates below 50 percent, reduce the time in a shared savings-only model from six to two years, and application of a +/- 3 percent risk adjustment cap across an extended agreement period.\r\n\r\nour opposition to and rationale for these proposed changes are outlined in the attached document.\r\n\r\nthese proposed changes will harm patients and providers by limiting improvements in savings and quality acos provide, while slowing progress made in transitioning to value-base payments. our aco has made a significant investment in funding the operations to support the mssp, and a reduction in potential savings will greatly impact our ability to reinvest in our care models/teams and will significantly limit our ability to generate enough capital to meet the repayment mechanism requirements. as a non-profit, low revenue aco, our aco may be forced out of the mssp because we will lack the capital required for the repayment mechanism. our initial intention was to build up that capital over the course of 6 years under the current system, but that timeline is drastically reduced with the proposed changes.\r\n\r\non the other hand, we support a number of proposals in the rule and encourage cms to finalize its proposals to: 1) move to five-year agreement periods; 2) reduce burdens related to quality reporting; 3) expand the use of waivers for telehealth and skilled nursing facility stays; and 4) provide flexibility with choosing assignment methodology regardless of risk model.\r\n\r\nthank you again for your work on behalf of patients and providers to advance value-based payment. we appreciate your interest in sustaining the success of medicare acos and creating an environment where providers are encouraged to enter into value-based payment arrangements and help patients receive high-quality, coordinate care.\r\n\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nkerry cogan,

is a not-for-profit community-based organization comprised solely of fqhcs in colorado.  our health centers are non-profit, community-directed providers that serve as the primary medical home for 790,000 patients in our state, including more than 1 in 7 coloradoans.\nwe welcome the opportunity to respond to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pathways to success nprm.  while we believe the proposed rule includes important steps toward increased success, there are several areas where we raise caution and seek clarification.  in summary, our comments will focus on the following areas:\nhealth centers are important partners in accountable care arrangements, producing cost savings for the system and enhanced quality of care for beneficiaries and look forward to continuing this work together.\ncms should invest in a more gradual pathway to increased levels of financial risk for low-revenue provider-led accountable care organizations (acos), with consideration made to those acos comprised solely of fqhcs.\nmany fqhcs, because they provide care to some of the most underserved communities in the country, require additional investment to prepare for two-sided risk arrangements.\nincreased flexibility in the ability to provide telehealth services will support health centers participating in the pathways to success program.\na more appropriate benchmarking process will support participating health centers in delivering the best care for the vulnerable populations they serve.\ncms should be mindful of inadvertently causing \u00e2\u0080\u009ccherry-picking\u00e2\u0080\u009d of patients by allowing acos to provide beneficiary incentives.\nwe are in opposition to a few key aspects of the recent proposed pathways to success rule, in particular the agency's proposal to cut acos shared savings rates below 50 percent, reduce the time in a shared savings-only model from six to two years, and application of a +/- 3 percent risk adjustment cap across an extended agreement period.\nthese proposed changes will harm patients and providers by limiting improvements in savings and quality acos provide, while slowing progress made in transitioning to value-base payments. our aco has made a significant investment in funding the operations to support the mssp, and a reduction in potential savings will greatly impact our ability to reinvest in our care models/teams and will significantly limit our ability to generate enough capital to meet the repayment mechanism requirements.  as a non-profit, low revenue aco, our aco may be forced out of the mssp because we will lack the capital required for the repayment mechanism. our initial intention was to build up that capital over the course of 6 years under the current system, but that timeline is drastically reduced with the proposed changes.\nwe appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recognition of the additional time many provider-led acos may need to transition to higher levels of two-sided risk by allowing provider-led acos to cycle through the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasic\u00e2\u0080\u009d track for two agreement periods.  however, this still only allows provider-led acos two years without taking on financial risk. due to the pace of data sharing and the imperative to transform care models, we recommend cms allow provider-led acos an even more gradual pathway to two-sided risk. specifically, we suggest cms allow provider-led acos a minimum of three years in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasic\u00e2\u0080\u009d track in an upside-only arrangement.\nwhile we support incorporating regional expenditures in the benchmark established for an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first agreement, we are concerned that the two proposed policies to limit the magnitude of the adjustment undermines the policy goals. as cms has recognized, the incorporation of regional expenditures provides an aco with a benchmark that is more reflective of ffs spending in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s region than a benchmark based solely on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own historical expenditures. this approach creates stronger financial incentives for acos that have been successful in reducing expenditures to remain in the program, thus improving program sustainability. it also allows cms to better capture the cost experience in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s region, the health status and socio-economic dynamics of the regional population, and location-specific medicare payments when compared to using national ffs expenditures.\nwe disagree that higher weights for the regional adjustment results in potential windfall gains to lower-cost acos. those gains are not windfalls but compensate lower-cost acos for the work invested in practices to reduce the overall costs of care for medicare beneficiaries. in fact, a lower-cost aco composed of fqhcs may have higher expenditures for primary care due to the prospective payment system (pps) methodology as compared to regional expenditures for primary care services that are generally reimbursed under the medicare fee schedule.  the risk adjustment benchmarking cap uniquely will harm our non-profit fqhc-based aco. in the past, our coding processes were fairly rudimentary which is evidenced by our unusually low risk adjustment scores and unusually low benchmarks given the patient population we serve.  our network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understanding of risk adjustment is relatively new, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve implemented coding improvement efforts to more accurately reflect the acuity of our patients and to better capture hcc codes annually.  the proposed limit of +/-3% would mitigate our efforts to improve in these crucial areas which impact our ability to be successful in the mssp.\non the other hand, we support a number of proposals in the rule and encourage cms to finalize its proposals to: 1) move to five-year agreement periods; 2) reduce burdens related to quality reporting; 3) expand the use of waivers for telehealth and skilled nursing facility stays; and 4) provide flexibility with choosing assignment methodology regardless of risk model.\nthe proposed provisions related to allowing acos to provide and be reimbursed for telehealth services, will help health centers continue to meet the unique needs of their communities in the most cost-efficient ways. however, while the preamble to the proposed rule outlines the process for which a provider can be reimbursed for his or her telehealth work, it is not clear how this new provision will impact health centers.  health centers are currently limited to serving as originating sites only and are not able to provide or be reimbursed as a distant site in medicare.  the preamble and proposed rule make reference to \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysicians and providers\u00e2\u0080\u009d using the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tin, however it is not clear if this provision will allow health centers to fully participate in the telehealth provisions.   we encourage cms to clarify the language in the proposed rule in order to clearly allow health centers to provide this valuable service through their work in an aco.\nfqhcs are unique in that they are both required by federal law and committed to serving everyone that seeks care and must serve communities most in need of care. they turn no patient away, regardless of income, insurance status, risk, or complexity. this open-door policy is a defining feature of the health center mission of providing quality, affordable access to care to all who need it. additionally, beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 freedom of choice is an important way for practices and payers, including medicare, to gauge practice effectiveness and the demand for access to health care services in specific communities. should cms decide to allow acos to incentivize beneficiaries, it should implement safeguards to ensure that higher-revenue acos do not inadvertently attract healthier patients, potentially skewing quality metrics and leaving sicker patients with fewer options.\nthank you again for your work on behalf of patients and providers to advance value-based payment. we appreciate your interest in sustaining the success of medicare acos and creating an environment where providers are encouraged to enter into value-based payment arrangements and help patients receive high-quality, coordinate care.\nsincerely,\nkerry cogan, ceo\ncommunity health provider alliance\n600 grant street, suite 800\ndenver, co 80203\n\n\n", "0183": "the honorable seema verma\r\nadministrator\r\ncenters for

participating in the aco who use cehrt to document and communicate clinical care to their patients or other health care providers meets or exceeds a specified threshold. for acos that are participating in a track (or payment model within a track) that meets the financial risk standard to be an advanced apm, we further propose to align this requirement with the cehrt use requirement for advanced apms under the quality payment program. in conjunction with this proposal, we propose to discontinue the use of the double-weighted quality measure assessing the percentage of eligible clinicians that successfully meet the promoting interoperability performance category base score (use of cehrt, aco\u00e2\u0080\u009311) in order to reduce burden and align with the requirements of

(80 fr 62601) under 45 cfr part 170 24 focuses on the 2015 edition of health it certification criteria that support patient care, patient participation in care delivery, and electronic exchange of interoperable health information. the 2015 edition final rule, which was issued on october 16, 2015, is expected to improve interoperability by adopting new and updated vocabulary and content

comments specific to sections of the proposed rule.\nbeneficiary incentives (page 309, section c, 2nd paragraph).\nin this section, cms proposes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe mirror the language in the proposed regulation text noting that \u00e2\u0080\u009ca qualifying service is a primary care service\u00e2\u0080\u009d a defined in 425.20, with respect to which coinsurance applies under part b.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nmost acos agree that the best practice for beneficiary engagement in wellness is to encourage them to utilize the medicare annual wellness visit (awv). this allows for a face to face with their primary doctor where the doctor and patient can discuss beneficiary concerns, provide or refer for preventative services, check on at-risk conditions such as diabetes, and establish a care plan. many acos that promote this visit notice an improvement in mssp quality measures.  however, cms does not apply a co-insurance to the awv, which, according to this definition, would disallow this important visit to be the focus of an incentive plan.  please consider a revised definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cqualifying service\u00e2\u0080\u009d so that incenting the awv can be an option.\nprogram measures and quality data \u00e2\u0080\u0093 part d (p 434-443\nwe understand the logic of aligning programs and initiatives, but at this time, bringing in quality measures for opioids does not seem like the right decision. the cms focus right now is to get acos to take on more risk, so let them focus on the key drivers that impact their population in their community, instead of side-tracking with this potentially large initiative that will no doubt take resources for which most acos do not currently have funding. each aco is unique in their participant mix, their resources, their aligned population, and their region. what works for one does not always work for another. bringing in quality measures that are this specific will detract acos from focusing on what does work for them.\nas an alternative, cms could provide acos with learning webinars for provider and aco education, and various tools and data for acos to incorporate into their current structure for care management and patient engagement. to augment this effort, please consider allowing access to part 2 data so acos can create appropriate and relevant clinical models to address the opioid situation.\naco-11 and promoting interoperability (page 443-454).\nin general, we have no concerns about the difference between 50% or 75% requirement between the different tracks.  it is reasonable to expect the higher tracks to have a higher cehrt adoption rate. however, we would ask that you delay this change because of inaccurate results from quality payment program. acos receive a supplemental aco11 file with their annual settlement packet. in the packet we received in august 2018 for the 2017 performance year, our aco11 file was incomplete, in that it did not contain all of our participating providers; in fact, it was missing about half.  due to the incomplete data, we were not able to measure where we truly are in terms of percentages for what is now called promoting interoperability.\nit would be great for a track 3 (enhanced) aco to tell a participant that they no longer need to sign into qpp and attest to promoting interoperability, specifically because the other quality reporting is done at the aco level and pi is the only category that requires a participant-initiated submission. however, without detail on how an aco would confirm this requirement for the purposes of an attestation, we are concerned that moving to an aco certification process may inadvertently place the aco in a non-compliant situation. is the standard for confirming a participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s status simple enough for an aco to confirm? many acos have participants that are on different ehrs. our aco would be confident in attesting to the ehr used by our employed clinicians, but we would have to do a separate analysis for each of our independent practices. the cehrt definition at 42 cfr 414.1305 seems to be more than an aco could confidently assess on their own. for example, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that we have the expertise to say that any given participant has a sufficient security plan [42 cfr 414.1305 (1)(ii)(a) (7)(c)]. we would ask that you better clarify the operational expectations for this attestation so that acos can confirm they are able to confidently attest.\nregarding the retiring of aco11 in favor of an attestation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if a new entity wants to join mssp and is willing to start in basic track e or enhanced, during application, the entity will have to survey every participant to ensure they meet for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attesting to cehrt.  this will add to the time investment of an application, especially for an entity with a high number of independent participants.  it might be reasonable to allow track e and enhanced to come in at 50% for the first performance year and then go to 75% in the second; it would be the equivalent of the pay for reporting in the quality measures in performance year 1.\n\n\n", "0191": "to medicare,\r\n\r\nas the medical director of a primary care physician led aco we are excited to have the opportunity to move into an enhanced aco track from our

administrator verma: thank you for this opportunity to provide comments on the medicare shared savings program (mssp). as an electronic health records developer based in verona, wisconsin, we at epic have significant experience supporting accountable care organizations (acos) using our software as they participate in mssp, as well as in other cms quality reporting programs. our experience informs our feedback here on the following specific proposals by cms:\nii.a.4.c proposals for permitting annual election of beneficiary assignment methodology \n for acos to use reports and dashboards in their ehr to get an overall picture of their beneficiary populations and to identify and act on health trends, they need to be able to accurately match patients between the roster and the ehr. acos need a minimum amount of demographic information to definitively determine that a patient on the roster is the same person as a patient in the ehr. the demographic information most commonly received on shared savings program roster files is name, date of birth, and sex. these three data points are not sufficient to confidently match or create a new patient record within the ehr. cms should also include the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full address (street, city, state, and zip code) and phone number in a consistently formatted file to allow acos to effectively and quickly match patients on the roster to patients in the ehr.\nii.c.3.a beneficiary notifications \n\n public comments on proposed pathways to success 2\n sharing would support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stated goal of ensuring patient access to program information, while minimizing the regulatory burden for individual providers.\nii.e.5 program data and quality measures \n we are committed to supporting organizations as they seek to combat the opioid crisis. we note that cms proposes two opioid quality measures that use a threshold of 120 morphine milligram equivalent (mme) per day. cms should work with nqf, the measure developer, to change the threshold to 90 mme per day to align with the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain1.\n we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made these suggestions to help further the support that ehrs can provide to acos as they participate in mssp and pursue cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed pathway to success.\n thank you for your

cost effectiveness, it must be fully inclusive of nps and their patients.\r\n\r\ntherefore, i support cms' proposal to update the voluntary alignment option for beneficiary assignment in the shared

working  with  the  most  vulnerable  people,  our  patients.    thus,  any transformation should be completed with care, dignity, and respect.  as physicians, we are creative problem solvers.  we are more than willing to take on the task of health care delivery reform.  we need such modifications to include our patients and community.  therefore, we wholeheartedly ask cms to consider the long game.  accountable care organizations have tremendous potential for true, ground up, transformation that can support the future.  we respectfully ask cms to provide us with the tools and time needed to help create success.\n mutually, we hereby recommend and or support the following:\n calculation of loss sharing limit for basic tracks - level e participation level (track 1+) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 acos should be allowed to participate at this level of risk, long  term  (multiple  contracts).    as  acos improve efficacy of health care delivery, they  will  reduce  overall  costs.    thus,  their  benchmarks  will  decline,  creating  very  small margins.  with smaller margins, it will be more challenging to achieve shared savings.  we think  it  is  important  for  acos  to  stay  in  the  mssp  program.    acos  bring  value  in  care coordination, improvement and maintained quality  metrics,  along  with  cost  containment. not every aco will be able to move to medicare advantage, nor will every aco be able to accept capitation type payments. therefore, level e participation has probability of meeting the long-term goals of the mssp program.\n\n\n 2\n permitting annual election of beneficiary assignment methodology - we  agree  with  the  proposal  to  choose  between  prospective  assignment  or  preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation for all aco tracks with an annual election process.\n monitoring financial performance lower growth in medicare part a & b expenditures (part of the triple aim) - monitoring aco financial performance - in the proposal, cms is recommending proceeding with early termination for any aco that has a negative performance outside the corridor for 2 performance years.  this is unreasonable. acos should have an opportunity to establish a corrective action plan.  additionally, due to the timing of receipt of final reconciliation, an aco will not have sufficient time to make and implement adjustments.  it is important for an aco  to  have  the  final  reconciliation  information  to  make  decisions,  because  final benchmarks can increase or decrease (which is not always predicable).  for example: the aco receives its year 1 final performance reports in august of year 2 and finds out their losses  are  outside  the  corridor.    the  aco  may  have  insufficient  time  to  affect  year  2 performance.  it will be able to initiate a corrective action plan for the remainder of year 2 and for the full year 3.  if it has losses outside the corridor in year 2, the aco will receive this final information in august of year 3.  the full accounting of the results of the corrective action plan will be assessed in august of year 4.  also, quarterly data should not be used for the determination of financial performance due to the natural seasonal variations in health care  spending  and  utilization.    due  to  the  natural  time  frame  to  implement  and  assess corrective actions, we recommend non-renewal of the next contract cycle rather than early termination.\n aco repayment mechanism for acos in two-sided model - termination - voluntary early termination - if the aco voluntarily terminates from the mssp program, the  aco  should  be  held  responsible  for  a  prorated  repayment  based  on  the  date  of termination.\n - involuntary termination (terminated by cms) - if cms terminates an aco, the aco should not be held responsible for any losses.  the aco was willing to continue to participate and meet obligations, but cms chose to terminate. therefore, it should be cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responsibility to address the loss.\n participation tracks election of msr/mlr by acos - we  agree  with  the  proposal  to  offer  acos  in  a  two-sided  model  the  option  to  choose msr/mlr.\n - we suggest the basic track one-sided model have the msr modified to a fixed 2% msr for 5,000+ beneficiaries and utilize a variable msr for below 5,000 beneficiaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3\n basic level e track vs. enhanced track - we understand from your proposed rule that certain basic track acos may have a lower repayment mechanism amount to reflect the potentially lower levels of loss liability.  we also understand the glide path for taking risk concluding at a level of risk that meets the standard  to  qualify  as  advanced  alternative  payment  model  (apm)  under  macra. however, when comparing basic level e and the enhanced tracks, the levels of exposure to losses and repayment mechanisms are considerably unbalanced.  for example, an aco with an  estimated  historical  benchmark  of  12k  per  capita, which participates in the enhanced track with 10,000 beneficiaries would potentially receive 50% more of shared savings, but would  be  exposing  itself  to  losses  37.5  times  more,  with  a  much  greater  repayment mechanism.  to try to earn $24 million, this aco risks losing $18 million.  while in level e, the exposure is 4%.  the aco in level e would risk $480,000 to earn $12 million, with a much  lower  repayment  mechanism. the  table  below further  illustrates  a  straightforward analysis  regarding  the  impact  of  downsize  risk.  cms  should decrease the  downside  risk overall for the enhanced track if the desired outcome of the proposed rule is for acos to take risk. lower downside risk would certainly be more attractive to those not only wanting to  join  the  aco  movement  of  improving  healthcare  and  reducing  costs,  but  also  moving forward from the basic track to the enhanced model.  this is especially true for physician- owned entities.  basic level e track is designed appropriately, but the enhanced track is simply unbearable.  the proposed rule will decrease the likelihood of participation from low revenue acos.  since most of us in the rio grande valley are participating in the current track 3 model, we are accustomed with bearing risk.  unfortunately, due to the proposed rules, we are forced to rethink strategically and operationally, both of which cause financial burden.  fundamentally, we are having to reconsider participation in the enhanced track altogether due to the downside risk and extensive operational costs to be successful.  we urge cms to provide a softer downside risk that facilitates proper investment and enough cushion in the benchmark that allows for additional revenue to be created.\n basic track - level e  enhanced track beneficiaries  max savings max shared savings max loss payment repayment mechanism  beneficiaries  max savings max shared savings max loss payment repayment mechanism 10,000  24 mil  12 mil  *480k  120k  10,000  32 mil  24 mil  18 mil  1.2 mil 20,000  48 mil  24 mil  960k  240k  20,000  64 mil  48 mil  36 mil  2.4 mil 30,000  72 mil  36 mil  1.44 mil  360k  30,000  96 mil  72 mil  54 mil  3.6 mil * 4% revenue of an estimated historical benchmark of 12k\n\n aco repayment mechanism tail requirements - we recommend modifying the repayment mechanism tail to 12 months from the end of the last performance year.  12 months will meet the run-out time for final reconciliation and payment of any associated losses.\n\n\n 4\n this is not an issue of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaming\u00e2\u0080\u009d the system.  it is a prudent practice to have stop loss/re- insurance to address unexpected risk.  furthermore, it would support acos to participate in the  enhanced  track  because  the  downside  risk  would  not  be  unendurable.  acos  need additional methods to repay losses.\n - cms should allow acos taking risk to obtain and maintain insurance coverage to address losses.\n participation agreement periods - due to the significant revisions contained in the proposed rule, we agree with cms to cancel the 2018 application cycle.  however, we strongly urge cms to commence the pathway to success program as of january 1, 2020.  acos with agreements set to expire as of december 31,  2018, should be offered the opportunity to extend that agreement by renewing for a fourth  performance  full  year,  which  should  last  twelve  months  from  january  1,  2019 through december 31, 2019.  under the proposed rule, having two separate performance years, january 1 through june 30 under current mssp and then july 1 through december 31 under the new pathways to success, would be extremely burdening not only for cms but for acos  as  well.    managing  and  implementing  necessary  modifications  to  operational processes  for  two  different  sets  of  populations  to  meet  program  and  organization expectations in one year would be considerably taxing and overall challenging.  moreover, receiving separate reconciliation reports for the two performance periods only adds to the complexity of the program, including the deciphering of appropriate financial distributions, if applicable.\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements - snf  3  day  waiver  -  we  agree  with  the  proposal  to  expand  eligibility  for  the  snf  3-day waiver  rule  to  include  acos  participating  in  a  two-sided  model  under  preliminary prospective  assignment  with  retrospective  reconciliation.    additionally,  while  we understand that the quality of snf selection must be maintained, we suggest a re-evaluation of the indicators that qualify snfs to be included in the application acceptance criteria. in many areas of the country, including rural areas, snfs which successfully maintain a rating of 3 or more stars, as currently required, are limited.  this makes it difficult to utilize the waiver to its fullest potential. perhaps focusing on a particular category under the cms 5- star quality rating system as reported on the nursing home compare website instead of an overall  rating  or  including  other  ratings  and  qualifications  may  help  with  the  successful utilization of the waiver.\n - telehealth  -  we  agree  that  eligible  physicians  and  practitioners  in  acos  under performance-based  risk  and  prospective  assignment  can  receive  payment  for  telehealth services  furnished  to  prospectively  assigned  beneficiaries.    we  recommend  cms  include acos  participating  in  a  two-sided  model  under  preliminary  prospective  assignment with retrospective reconciliation as eligible for the telehealth waiver.  thus, aco eligibility will be the same for both the snf and telehealth waivers.  it will create consistency and be more streamlined for cms to manage.\n\n\n 5\n - funding from outside entities - we urge cms to reconsider their prohibition on accepting funds from outside sources to fund the beneficiary incentive program.  we fully appreciate the concerns raised about undue influence and its potential.  we think it is possible to set up appropriate boundaries and accounting mechanisms for any outside funds that they could be used judiciously.  if cms allows outside funds to be used, we expect the aco to have a public disclosure of the funding source(s).\n - additional waivers / beneficiary enhancements - having reliable transportation has been quite  challenging  for  our  population.    if  patients  cannot  visit  with  their  primary  care physicians due to lack of transportation, they aren't able to benefit from proper health care, care  coordination,  health  management,  etc.    we  request  that  cms  include  the  $20 beneficiary  enhancement  payment  for  transportation  costs,  not  only  for  a  qualifying primary care service.  for example, if a patient does not have the transportation needed to visit an aco clinic, can the aco clinic pay for a taxi or other to ensure the patient receives health  care?    assisting  patients  with  transportation  will  also  reduce  unnecessary hospitalizations in the long run.\n beneficiary opt-in based on assignment methodology medicare advantage plan \u00e2\u0080\u0093 leakage of beneficiaries - voluntary  alignment  -  this  is  a  good  idea.    however,  we  have  experienced  operational issues  and  our  patients  have  found  the  process  difficult.  is  there  way  to  simplify  the process?\n - opt-in enrollment process - although an opt-in enrollment is a valuable idea and utilized by health plans, many acos do not have the infrastructure or the staff necessary to effectively operate such a process.  we agree with medicare, as indicated in the proposed rule, there is no  connection  between  opt-in  enrollment  and  actual  utilization  of  primary  care  services. we agree this is not the answer to the beneficiary alignment issues of the program.\n benchmark cms-hcc risk scores - newly  and  continuously  assigned  beneficiary  distinction  -  we  agree with removing  this distinction.\n - 3% symmetrical cap - allowing for changes in the cms-hcc risk scores for the beneficiary population  is  a  significant  improvement.  it  will  partially  address  the  issue  of  the  aging population in the aco over the contract cycle.  with moving to a 5-year contract cycle, we recommend  consideration  of  an  asymmetrical  cap,  such  as  3%  downward  and  a  10% upward cap to be phased in over the 5-year contract cycle.  this will account for the aging of the population and natural progression of disease over the 5-year contract.  example: year 1 (3% down / 3% up); year 2 (3% down / 4% up); year 3 (3% down / 6% up); year 4 (3% down / 8% up); year 5 (3% down / 10% up).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6\n we appreciate the opportunity to submit these comments and sincerely hope they provide you with useful feedback as you finalize pathways to success.\n sincerely,\n\n\n rio grande valley acos:\n sheila m. magoon, md buena vida y salud, llc 2202 s. 77 sunshine strip, suite h harlingen tx 78550 (956) 412-3235\n jose f.

program into the two-sided model. for too long healthcare provided has been based on numbers and not quality of care. a facility seeing a high number of patients means nothing if a law or poor quality of care is given, thus leading to poor patient outcome. with this two sided model not only will participants be rewarded for good care provided they will also have to pay for loss. this alone i believe will entice participants to \"up their game\" and be on top of staff and hold themselves more accountable for care provided. the number one goal is improve patient care as well as increase savings for providers. by requesting or demanding higher accountability will yield more positive results. improving population health management is important alongside positive patient outcomes. i believe that somewhere along the way the healthcare industry lost sight of the main goal which was to help patients. over the years facilities have just been focused on getting patient in and moving them out. with this new ruling it helps bring back the original goal of positive patient outcomes. this new form of accountability helps bring all the pieces together and helps each party take part in the care of patients will providing lower out of pocket expenses. i fully believe that once health care providers start to see results from this new process they will be more inclined to adhere to the new contracts and then other facilities will follow.     \r\n     ", "0199": "see attached file(s)the honorable seema verma\nadministrator\ncenters for medicare & medicaid services\nu.s. department of

practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos.  these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community.  as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success.\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finite resources.\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total population, instead of differentiating between \u00e2\u0080\u009cnewly assigned\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinuously assigned\u00e2\u0080\u009d beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality,  the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my office\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations.\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our

alliance (chpa), we would like to take this opportunity to express the interest federally qualified health centers (referred to here as fqhcs, or \u00e2\u0080\u009chealth centers\u00e2\u0080\u009d) have in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\nour aco is a not-for-profit community-based organization comprised solely of fqhcs in colorado.  our health centers are non-profit, community-directed providers that serve as the primary medical home for 790,000 patients in our state, including more than 1 in 7 coloradoans.\nwe welcome the opportunity to respond to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pathways to success nprm.  while we believe the proposed rule includes important steps toward increased success, there are several areas where we raise caution and seek clarification.  in summary, our comments will focus on the following areas:\nhealth centers are important partners in accountable care arrangements, producing cost savings for the system and enhanced quality of care for beneficiaries and look forward to continuing this work together.\ncms should invest in a more gradual pathway to increased levels of financial risk for low-revenue provider-led accountable care organizations (acos), with consideration made to those acos comprised solely of fqhcs.\nmany fqhcs, because they provide care to some of the most underserved communities in the country, require additional investment to prepare for two-sided risk arrangements.\nincreased flexibility in the ability to provide telehealth services will support health centers participating in the pathways to success program.\na more appropriate benchmarking process will support participating health centers in delivering the best care for the vulnerable populations they serve.\ncms should be mindful of inadvertently causing \u00e2\u0080\u009ccherry-picking\u00e2\u0080\u009d of patients by allowing acos to provide beneficiary incentives.\nwe are in opposition to a few key aspects of the recent proposed pathways to success rule, in particular the agency's proposal to cut acos shared savings rates below 50 percent, reduce the time in a shared savings-only model from six to two years, and application of a +/- 3 percent risk adjustment cap across an extended agreement period.\nthese proposed changes will harm patients and providers by limiting improvements in savings and quality acos provide, while slowing progress made in transitioning to value-base payments. our aco has made a significant investment in funding the operations to support the mssp, and a reduction in potential savings will greatly impact our ability to reinvest in our care models/teams and will significantly limit our ability to generate enough capital to meet the repayment mechanism requirements.  as a non-profit, low revenue aco, our aco may be forced out of the mssp because we will lack the capital required for the repayment mechanism. our initial intention was to build up that capital over the course of 6 years under the current system, but that timeline is drastically reduced with the proposed changes.\nwe appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recognition of the additional time many provider-led acos may need to transition to higher levels of two-sided risk by allowing provider-led acos to cycle through the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasic\u00e2\u0080\u009d track for two agreement periods.  however, this still only allows provider-led acos two years without taking on financial risk. due to the pace of data sharing and the imperative to transform care models, we recommend cms allow provider-led acos an even more gradual pathway to two-sided risk. specifically, we suggest cms allow provider-led acos a minimum of three years in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasic\u00e2\u0080\u009d track in an upside-only arrangement.\nwhile we support incorporating regional expenditures in the benchmark established for an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first agreement, we are concerned that the two proposed policies to limit the magnitude of the adjustment undermines the policy goals. as cms has recognized, the incorporation of regional expenditures provides an aco with a benchmark that is more reflective of ffs spending in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s region than a benchmark based solely on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own historical expenditures. this approach creates stronger financial incentives for acos that have been successful in reducing expenditures to remain in the program, thus improving program sustainability. it also allows cms to better capture the cost experience in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s region, the health status and socio-economic dynamics of the regional population, and location-specific medicare payments when compared to using national ffs expenditures.\nwe disagree that higher weights for the regional adjustment results in potential windfall gains to lower-cost acos. those gains are not windfalls but compensate lower-cost acos for the work invested in practices to reduce the overall costs of care for medicare beneficiaries. in fact, a lower-cost aco composed of fqhcs may have higher expenditures for primary care due to the prospective payment system (pps) methodology as compared to regional expenditures for primary care services that are generally reimbursed under the medicare fee schedule.  the risk adjustment benchmarking cap uniquely will harm our non-profit fqhc-based aco. in the past, our coding processes were fairly rudimentary which is evidenced by our unusually low risk adjustment scores and unusually low benchmarks given the patient population we serve.  our network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understanding of risk adjustment is relatively new, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve implemented coding improvement efforts to more accurately reflect the acuity of our patients and to better capture hcc codes annually.  the proposed limit of +/-3% would mitigate our efforts to improve in these crucial areas which impact our ability to be successful in the mssp.\non the other hand, we support a number of proposals in the rule and encourage cms to finalize its proposals to: 1) move to five-year agreement periods; 2) reduce burdens related to quality reporting; 3) expand the use of waivers for telehealth and skilled nursing facility stays; and 4) provide flexibility with choosing assignment methodology regardless of risk model.\nthe proposed provisions related to allowing acos to provide and be reimbursed for telehealth services, will help health centers continue to meet the unique needs of their communities in the most cost-efficient ways. however, while the preamble to the proposed rule outlines the process for which a provider can be reimbursed for his or her telehealth work, it is not clear how this new provision will impact health centers.  health centers are currently limited to serving as originating sites only and are not able to provide or be reimbursed as a distant site in medicare.  the preamble and proposed rule make reference to \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysicians and providers\u00e2\u0080\u009d using the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tin, however it is not clear if this provision will allow health centers to fully participate in the telehealth provisions.   we encourage cms to clarify the language in the proposed rule in order to clearly allow health centers to provide this valuable service through their work in an aco.\nfqhcs are unique in that they are both required by federal law and committed to serving everyone that seeks care and must serve communities most in need of care. they turn no patient away, regardless of income, insurance status, risk, or complexity. this open-door policy is a defining feature of the health center mission of providing quality, affordable access to care to all who need it. additionally, beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 freedom of choice is an important way for practices and payers, including medicare, to gauge practice effectiveness and the demand for access to health care services in specific communities. should cms decide to allow acos to incentivize beneficiaries, it should implement safeguards to ensure that higher-revenue acos do not inadvertently attract healthier patients, potentially skewing quality metrics and leaving sicker patients with fewer options.\nthank you again for your work on behalf of patients and providers to advance value-based payment. we appreciate your interest in sustaining the success of medicare acos and creating an environment where providers are encouraged to enter into value-based payment arrangements and help patients receive high-quality, coordinate care.\nsincerely,\nkevin l. maddox\nchief financial officer\nsunrise community health\n2930 11th avenue\nevans, co  80620\n\n", "0201":

\u00e2\u0080\u009cnewly assigned\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinuously assigned\u00e2\u0080\u009d beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality,  the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my office\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations.\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our community.\nsincerely,\n{provider name}\n{practice name}\naugusta

administrator\n centers for medicare and medicaid services hubert h. humphrey building\n 200 independence avenue, sw, room 445-g washington, dc 20201\n re: comments on cms-1701-p; shared savings program proposed rule\n dear administrator verma:\n\n caravan health appreciates the opportunity to comment on the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) proposed rule on the shared savings program. our comments related to specific aspects of the proposed rule are below.\n\n > cms should ensure the ongoing availability of a no-risk aco option for rural providers\n while caravan is generally supportive of cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed basic and enhanced option acos, we encourage cms to maintain a no-risk option for rural providers that wish to participate in an aco.\n caravan health firmly believes that it is imperative for acos remain open to smaller and rural providers, however such providers should not be required to take on downside risk. experience shows us that these providers can and will succeed but operating in a rural market remains a delicate endeavor. nearly fifty percent of rural hospitals annually lose money on operations. in such an environment, it is implausible to expect rural providers to enter into a program that requires them to potentially pay back federal health care dollars.\n\n caravan health\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s small and rural aco clients have achieved excellent clinical quality scores above national averages even as they beat their spending benchmarks, however, the natural year-to-year variation in performance and risk of paying back shared losses even in a single year is too much uncertainty for providers that live on the margins. the required move to downside risk is appropriate for urban health care systems that have the scale and resources to absorb a bad year.\n but for their rural counterparts, potential downside risk makes participation in an aco untenable, and it is cms and patients in rural areas that will ultimately pay the price.\n\n as such, caravan health urges cms to consider a no-risk option in the shared savings program, available only to rural providers and those operating in medically underserved areas. with the addition of a rural aco, no-risk option to the shared savings program, caravan health supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s recently proposed changes. we agree that for most providers, a steady progression from no- risk to moderate downside risk over a five-year period is appropriate. we also agree with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s allowance for physician group-based acos to remain in the basic option for an additional term,\n\n\n while the typically better-resourced, hospital-based entities move more quickly to the enhanced option.\n\n > cms should maintain flexibility for aco participants to implement waiver programs as locally appropriate\n caravan health is intrigued by cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed beneficiary incentive program and believes it is a promising tool for aco participants. as cms provides future guidance on this and other shared savings waiver programs, we urge cms to maintain flexibility for acos to implement them ona participant level, as appropriate for their area and patient population.\n\n while we agree it is helpful for the aco to apply for waiver programs as a collective to ensure the aco board is involved in the required decision-making, participants within an aco often operate in different environments that are not served well by a one-size-fits-all approach. this will be especially true in the case of the beneficiary incentive program where aco participants may want to assign different incentive amounts based upon their region.\n\n to be effective, caravan health believes there must be flexibility for acos to adopt waiver programs that may be implemented, within specified guidelines, on an individual basis by the aco participants. in the absence of such flexibility, independent providers in convened acos will be ata disadvantage relative to large consolidated systems, and cms will inadvertently contribute to the pressure for health care providers to consolidate.\n\n > cms should eliminate patient cost-sharing for primary care and care management services provided within an aco\n as mentioned above, caravan health sees significant promise in the proposed beneficiary incentive program. we encourage cms to explore additional tools like the beneficiary incentive program; tools to encourage patients to seek and receive preventative and care management services that lower costs and reduce unnecessary utilization. in particular, we urge cms to consider options that would eliminate patient cost-sharing for primary care and care management services.\n\n in our work with shared savings program acos, we coach the value of annual wellness visits and chronic care management to successfully improving the quality and lowering the cost of care. we\n have seen that these strategies work and yield savings to cms. however, the administrative hassle of collecting co-payments for chronic care management leads many providers to simply not offer\n the service. for providers that continue to offer the service, they face the uphill battle of collecting the required co-payment without damaging the patient-provider relationship.\n\n caravan health encourages cms to propose a policy whereby any service included as part of the shared savings program attribution is paid in full by cms. such a policy would go a long way towards engaging patients as well as improving overall health outcomes. acos and other alternative payment models have created the right incentives for providers to emphasize primary care and wellness over sick care. we believe cms must now align the incentives for medicare beneficiaries by removing cost-sharing from those services that have been demonstrated to lower the total cost of care.\n\n\nwww.caravanhealth.com\n\n\n\n > current beneficiary notification requirements are more than sufficient\n caravan health is strongly opposed to the new beneficiary notification requirement proposed by\ncms. not only is this new requirement extremely burdensome, but this exact type of notification\n has already been tried by cms and rightly rejected.\n\n when cms first began its aco experiment with pioneer acos in 2012, those acos were required to mail a beneficiary notification strikingly similar to the requirement now proposed for the shared savings program acos. cms quickly replaced the mailing requirement with the current poster and notice to patients (see 42 cfr \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 425.312) after the letter was deemed confusing to beneficiaries and extremely burdensome and costly for acos to implement.\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal is particularly confounding in light of the already robust process in place. cms currently requires aco participants to post the aco poster in all of their facilities and make the notice to patients available in all primary care settings. these notices are required to be on a cms template, to which cms makes minor changes every year. the hassle of keeping up with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s new templates and replacing posters present in every aco facility is already quite burdensome and costly to participants. cms provides no evidence that the posters and notices are not working and proposes to add a third, even more burdensome requirement, without modification of the existing two.\n\n it is precisely these types of unnecessary hoops that prevent organizations from wanting to engage in acos. additionally, cms offers zero evidence that medicare beneficiaries are not already adequately notified. experience has proven that notifications tend to confuse patients more than anything, creating stigma and actually reducing the provider\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s ability to effectively manage the care of their patients. cms repeatedly emphasizes that that providers, not patients, participate in the aco, and thus caravan health is unconvinced that beneficiaries require any additional notification regarding the confusing world of alternative payment models in which their provider is involved.\n\n if cms feels strongly that beneficiaries should know when they are attributed to an aco, then as the holder of claims data that is a function cms should undertake. the proposed cost-shifting to providers is senseless given their participation in the aco so they can reduce wasteful spending, not contribute to it.\n\n > caravan supports proposed changes to the benchmark methodology\n caravan health supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s correction to the benchmark methodology. we are pleased that cms is finally acknowledging that many providers improve the accuracy of their risk coding as a result of aco participation, resulting in accurate patient risk scores that may either increase or decrease during benchmark re-basing. our only suggestion is that cms should align the threshold for the maximum impact of the regional adjustment and hcc risk score, setting both at +/- five percent.\n\n > cms should maintain aco-11 through performance year 2019 before moving to cehrt attestation\n while caravan health is ultimately supportive of the change from aco-11 to annual cehrt attestation, given the timing of this rule, we believe cms should delay the transition until the start of performance year 2020.\n\n\nwww.caravanhealth.com\n\n\n\n we understand cms crafted this policy with its july 1, 2019 start acos in mind, however, a large number of providers currently in track 1 acos will be subject to the policy change beginning six months earlier, on january 1, 2019. the late release of the shared savings program proposed rule means participants with a twelve-month 2019 performance year will have only weeks before the new policy. this is not enough time for those acos to make basic preparations, including surveys to determine their current cehrt versions and percent meeting the required cehrt standard.\n without this information acos are forced to enter the year with the possibility of non-compliance with a key cms requirement.\n\n caravan health urges cms to delay the transition to cehrt attestation until the start of performance year 2020 so as not to inadvertently penalize track 1 acos that have not had time to conduct this analysis. alternatively, we ask that cms specify that the attestation requirement is effective only for aco performance years beginning july 1, 2019 or thereafter.\n\n thank you again for the opportunity to provide comment. if you have any questions or wish to discuss any of our comments further, we would be happy to assist.\n\n sincerely,\n jp\n leeann hastings policy & compliance officer caravan

administrator verma:\n\n i welcome the opportunity to comment on the centers for medicare and medicaid services\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 (cms)\n \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-- pathways to success\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 notice of proposed rulemaking. this letter comments on several different aspects of the proposed rule, primarily proposals to reconfigure participation options in the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and proposals to change the benchmark methodology.\n\n my main recommendations on each of these portions of the proposed rule are as follows:\n\n e curtailing one-sided participation options: the requirement that all acos quickly accept two-sided risk could improve the performance of acos that continue to participate in the mssp, but would also reduce mssp participation. cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal does not strike an obviously unreasonable balance between these competing considerations, but there is real uncertainty about the correct policy path. thus, if cms finalizes this proposal, cms should carefully monitor mssp participation and change course if participation falls precipitously.\n regardless, cms should correct its claim that participation in mssp via one-sided models has increased medicare spending to date, which contradicts the best evidence.\n\n e shifting to five-year agreement periods: shifting to five-year agreement periods would strengthen acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending by breaking the link between acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 performance in the first two years of each agreement period and their future benchmarks.\n cms should finalize this proposal. to align with this change, cms should begin using five-year spending averages rather than three-year spending averages when establishing\n acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 benchmarks. while this modification would worsen incentives during the first two years of each agreement period, it would improve them during the final three years of an agreement period. on average over the entirety of a five-year agreement period, this modification to cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal would likely improve incentives modestly.\n\n changing the method of measuring acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 total revenue: cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to measure acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 total part a and b revenue based solely acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 participant lists, rather than also counting revenue received by providers with an ownership or operational interest in one or more aco participants, could allow acos that are affiliated with a hospital to access participation options that are intended for physician-only acos. thus, if cms is going to vary the rules that apply to acos based on their total part a and b revenue, it should count revenue received by the broader set of providers.\n\n modifying the risk adjustment methodology: cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to rely solely on changes in cms-hcc risk scores for the purposes of risk adjustment during an agreement period has the potential to simplify and improve risk adjustment in mssp. however, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to limit benchmark adjustments to 3 percent in either direction is flawed. at a minimum, cms should eliminate the limit on downward benchmark adjustments in order to deter risk selection by acos. cms should also eliminate the limit on upward adjustments, which undermines risk adjustment\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s ability to protect acos from idiosyncratic deterioration in patient mix, and instead implement other policies that limit acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 ability to benefit from aggressive coding of patient diagnoses.\n\n capping and shrinking the regional adjustment to aco benchmarks: cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to reduce the size of the regional adjustment would likely increase participation in the mssp by acos with high spending relative to their regions, but would weaken participating acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending by strengthening the link between acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 current performance and their future benchmarks. the analysis cms uses to justify this proposal ignores the downsides of this policy change, so cms should conduct additional analysis that takes account of these negative effects and reconsider its proposal based on the outcome of that analysis. cms should also consider alternative changes to the benchmarking methodology that could encourage participation by historically high spending acos without undermining acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending.\n\n implementing a national-regional blend for calculating trend factors: rather than adopting benchmark trend factors based on blend of national and regional spending growth rates, cms should continue to use purely regional trend factors, but exclude an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries when computing the trend factors that apply to that aco. when an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s service area does not include enough enrollees not aligned with the aco to compute reliable trend factors, cms should include data from adjacent or otherwise similar counties. cms should also exclude an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries when computing the regional spending average used in computing the regional adjustment.\n\n using regional factors during an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period: cms should finalize its proposal to use regional trend factors when establishing and updating an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s\n benchmark during its first agreement period. cms should also finalize its proposal to apply\n 2\n a regional adjustment when establishing an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark for a first agreement period, but it should conduct additional analysis to determine the size of that adjustment.\n\n the remainder of this letter discusses my comments on each of these portions of the rule in greater detail. please note that the views expressed in this letter are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of officers, trustees, or other staff members of the brookings institution.\n\n curtailing one-sided mssp participation options (section it.a.3 of the nprm)\n\n the proposed rule would reconfigure providers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 options for participating in the mssp, replacing the existing mssp tracks 1, 2, and 3, as well as the center for medicare and medicaid innovation (cmmi) track 1+ model, with basic and enhanced tracks within the mssp. most consequentially, these changes would sharply curtail acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 ability to participate in the mssp under models that require only one-sided risk. currently, acos can participate under one-sided risk for up to six years via the track 1 model. under the proposed rule, acos could participate under one-sided risk for at most two years via the proposed basic track. after that two-year period, an aco would have to participate in a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3level\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 of the basic track that includes downside risk similar to that under the current track 1+ model, or in the enhanced track, which is essentially the same as the current track 3.\n\n requiring acos to bear two-sided risk has both advantages and disadvantages, and there is real uncertainty about how to weigh these competing considerations. there are two main benefits to consider. first, requiring two-sided risk strengthens acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending. under one-sided risk, reducing spending only generates financial rewards for the aco if the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s spending comes in at a level that makes the aco eligible for shared savings. but because spending outcomes have a significant random component even effective acos will sometimes be ineligible for shared savings. under two-sided risk, reducing spending can pay off for the aco even if the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s spending exceeds its benchmark by reducing the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s shared loss payments. second, acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 shared loss payments directly benefit the federal budget. both of these benefits are plausibly significant, although the importance of the first is hard to quantify with existing evidence.\n\n on the other hand, requiring acos to bear downside risk will cause some acos that would have participated in the mssp under one-sided risk to leave the program. acos that currently have spending above the average in their region would be particularly likely to depart because aco benchmarks are based in part on regional average spending; for these acos, the expected cost of making shared loss payments would tend to exceed the expected benefit of receiving shared savings payments. other acos might lack the capital required to make a significant shared loss payment and thus decline to participate, even if they thought they were much more likely to receive a shared savings payment than to be required to make a shared loss payment.\n\n at various points in the proposed rule, cms suggests that losing acos that currently participate in mssp via track 1 would not be cause for concern. in particular, cms cites an analysis that compares track 1 acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 actual spending to their benchmarks to argue that track 1 acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096\n participation in mssp actually increased federal spending on net in 2016. if that were the case, then losing these providers from the mssp might indeed be a benign outcome.!\n however, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 analysis is misleading. as other analysts have emphasized, acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 benchmarks are set based on policy considerations and do not measure what acos would have spent in the absence of the mssp, so they cannot be used to gauge the causal effect of the mssp on medicare spending.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 consistent with this, research that compares acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 spending to true counterfactuals found that the mssp reduced federal spending in 2015, despite the fact that the vast majority of mssp acos in 2015 were participating through track 1.* that research found that aco performance was either stable or improving over time, so it is plausible that a similar analysis for 2016 would find similar or better results. simply comparing acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 actual spending to their benchmarks also does not capture \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3spillover\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 effects acos may have on beneficiaries that are not assigned to the aco; notably, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 own regulatory impact analysis concludes that these spillover effects have been substantial, and, on this basis, concludes that the mssp generated large net savings for the medicare program in 2016. thus, the best evidence implies that losing a significant number of acos that currently participate in the mssp via track 1 would have real costs\n it is uncertain how much eliminating track 1 would reduce participation in the mssp. track 1 currently accounts for more than three-quarters of aligned beneficiaries associated with acos participating in the mssp or track 1+. it is doubtful that all of these acos would leave the program if required to take on two-sided risk. some would ultimately have transitioned to two- sided risk on their own as they gained experience with mssp and gained greater familiarity with the bonus payments available under the quality payment program. additionally, if two-sided risk became a required feature of mssp participation, new structures to help providers bear that risk would likely emerge. for example, acos commonly participate in the mssp in collaboration with a third-party service provider; these service providers may be able to bear a portion of this risk on acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 behalf if necessary. nevertheless, as cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 regulatory impact analysis recognizes, requiring two-sided risk will likely cause some meaningful reduction in mssp participation.\n\n given the paucity of evidence on how acos would behave under different policy regimes, it is hard to definitively weigh the benefits of improved incentives for mssp participants against the costs in the form of reduced

in mssp and change course if necessary. cms should correct its claim that participation in mssp via one-sided models has increased medicare spending to date.\n\n shifting to five-year agreement periods (section ii.a.2 of the nprm)\n\n the proposed rule would lengthen aco agreement periods to five years, up from three years under current regulations. this proposal would likely strengthen acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending.\n as discussed in detail later in this comment letter, the benchmark rebasing that occurs at the start of each new agreement period can undermine acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending because rebased benchmarks are based in part on acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 own recent spending. as a result, acos that reduce spending today are \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3penalized\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 with lower benchmarks in the future.\n\n shifting to five-year agreement periods eliminates this problem for the first two years of each agreement period because rebasing calculations only use the most recent three years of spending data. for this reason, the proposal would be an improvement over the status quo. however, if the shift to five-year agreement periods is finalized, cms should consider changing rebasing calculations to use five-year spending averages rather than the three-year spending averages currently used. this would reintroduce the incentive problem described above during the first two years of an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s agreement period, but ameliorate the problem during the final three years of an agreement period. on average over the entirety of a five-year agreement period, this modification to cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal would likely improve incentives modestly.\n\n summary of recommendations: cms should finalize its proposal to lengthen aco agreement periods to five years. to align with this change, cms should begin using five-year spending averages rather than three-year spending averages in rebasing calculations.\n\n changing the method of measuring an acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 total revenue (section ii.a.3 and section ii.a.5 of the nprm)\n\n cms proposes to vary its treatment of acos based on their total revenue under medicare parts a and b. acos whose total part a and b revenue is less than 25 percent of total spending by their assigned beneficiaries would be allowed to participate in the basic track for a longer period.\n additionally, shared losses paid by acos participating in the basic track would be limited to no more than 8 percent of total part a and b revenue. cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 objective in configuring the program in this way is to provide more lenient terms to acos that do not include a hospital.\n\n cms proposes to define an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s total part a and b revenue as the total part a and b revenue received by the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participants. this definition departs significantly from the definition used in the track 1+ model, under which cms also counted part a and b revenue received by providers with an ownership or operational interest in one or more aco participants.\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach has a serious shortcoming. failing to count revenue earned by entities with an ownership relationship to aco participants would allow many acos that are affiliated with a hospital to access participation options that are intended for physician-only acos.\n consider, for example, an aco that consists of a hospital and a set of hospital-owned physician practices. under cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach, the aco could list the physician practices as aco\n 5\n participants, but not list the hospital. this would greatly reduce the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s measured part a and b revenue, allowing it to participate in the mssp while bearing much less financial risk.\n\n citing experience under track 1+, cms argues that counting revenue earned by entities with an ownership or operational interest in aco participants would not appreciably change an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s measured part a and b revenue in most cases. but the track 1+ evidence cannot speak to the key policy question. precisely because track 1+ counts revenue earned by providers with an ownership or operational interest in an aco participant, there was no incentive to strategically exclude these providers from an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participant list. experience under track 1+ is therefore uninformative regarding the potential importance of this type of strategic behavior.\n\n summary of recommendations: if cms is going to vary the rules that apply to acos based on their total part a and b revenue, it should count revenue received by entities that have ownership and operational interests in aco participants, not just revenue received by providers on an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participant list.\n\n modifying the risk adjustment methodology used during an agreement period (section ii.d.2 of the nprm)\n\n cms currently uses a relatively complex method to adjust an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark for changes in the risk profile of its beneficiaries since the start of an agreement period. for newly aligned beneficiaries, cms uses cms-hcc risk scores to adjust for changes in risk mix. for beneficiaries continuously aligned with an aco since the start of an agreement period, cms adjusts their contribution to the benchmark for demographic changes and makes a downward adjustment if these beneficiaries\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 risk scores decline, but makes no corresponding adjustment if risk scores rise.\n the proposed rule would eliminate the distinction between continuously and newly aligned beneficiaries and instead adjust an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark based on the full change in the average cms-hcc risk score of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s beneficiaries, except that the total adjustment to the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark would be limited to a maximum of 3 percent in either direction.\n\n the revised methodology has two virtues; it is simpler than the old methodology, and it better protects acos against deteriorations in their patient mix. however, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to cap risk- score-based adjustments at 3 percent in either direction is problematic. most importantly, the limit on downward adjustments will encourage acos to avoid sicker enrollees and seek out healthier enrollees since, once an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s risk score has declined by at least 3 percent, risk adjustment will no longer offset the benefits of risk selection to the aco. at a minimum, therefore, cms should eliminate the cap on downward adjustments in acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 risk scores.\n\n on the other end of the spectrum, capping upward adjustments limits risk adjustment\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s ability to compensate acos for random changes in their patient mix. this reduces the predictability of acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 financial performance and thereby makes mssp participation less attractive. cms is correct to worry that allowing unlimited upward adjustments could allow acos to profitably increase coding intensity. however, strong incentives to increase coding intensity already exist since cms already fully incorporates an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s risk score when setting an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark at the start of an agreement period. moreover, there are better ways of addressing coding concerns.\n in particular, cms could implement a coding intensity adjustment like the one used in medicare\n advantage, create audit mechanisms to detect inappropriate coding, and introduce harsher penalties for acos found to have engaged in inappropriate coding.\n\n summary of recommendations: cms should finalize its proposals to update benchmarks based on changes in cms-hcc risk scores. however, cms should not finalize the proposed cap on risk- score-based adjustments. at a minimum, cms should eliminate the cap on downward adjustments in order to deter risk selection by acos. cms should also eliminate the cap on upward adjustments and implement other policies aimed at limiting acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 ability to benefit from aggressive coding.\n\n capping and shrinking the regional adjustment to aco benchmarks (section ii.d.3.c of the nprm)\n\n to establish an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark for its second and subsequent agreement periods, cms undertakes a two-step process: (1) cms computes average spending by the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s beneficiaries during the three years immediately preceding the agreement period; and (2) it adds a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3regional adjustment\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 equal to percentage of the difference between regional average spending and the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own historical spending. the percentage used in computing the regional adjustment depends on how long the aco has been participating in the program and how the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s spending compares to average spending in its region. under this approach, each aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark is effectively a weighted average of spending by the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s assigned beneficiaries and average spending in the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s region during the years before each agreement period.\n\n cms proposes to reduce the size of the regional adjustment in two ways. first and likely most importantly, cms proposes to limit the total size of the regional adjustment to 5 percent of national average fee-for-service spending. second, cms proposes to make the underlying regional adjustment a smaller percentage of the difference between regional average spending and the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own historical spending in the long run, reducing the relevant percentage from 70 percent to 50 percent. (cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal would have more complicated effects in the short and medium run.\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to apply a regional adjustment for acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 first agreement period, discussed in greater detail below, would increase the weight placed on regional spending in some cases.)\n\n evaluating these proposed changes is challenging because determining the appropriate size of the regional adjustment requires trading off various competing considerations. on the positive side, a larger regional adjustment strengthens participating acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to make care more efficient.\n this is because the regional adjustment weakens the link between an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s future benchmarks and its own past spending, which reduces the extent to which lowering spending today reduces the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s future benchmarks. additionally, the regional adjustment increases the expected reward to attracting an additional beneficiary for low-spending acos and reduces it for high-spending acos, which may encourage more efficient providers to expand their market share, while discouraging less efficient providers from doing so.\n\n on the other hand, it is also important to consider how the regional adjustment affects incentives for mssp participation by different types of acos, as well as the attendant implications for medicare spending. a modest regional adjustment can actually improve participation incentives because it accounts for the tendency of acos that were low-spending in prior periods to experience somewhat faster growth in subsequent years (and vice versa), a phenomenon known as\n \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3mean reversion.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5* due to mean reversion, basing benchmarks solely on an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own recent spending will tend to give historically high-spending acos benchmarks that are higher than needed to get them to participate in the program, providing them with an unnecessary windfall at, while giving historically low-spending acos benchmarks that may be too low to get them to participate, forfeiting the opportunity to improve the efficiency of those providers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 care.\n\n however, a regional adjustment that goes beyond what is needed to account for mean revision\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 which the existing adjustment almost certainly does\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6creates the opposite problem. a large regional adjustment makes mssp participation less attractive for historically high-spending acos, potentially forfeiting the opportunity to improve the performance of those relatively inefficient providers. at the same time, a regional adjustment beyond what is needed to account for mean reversion will provide windfall benefits to historically low-spending acos.\u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u0096\u0091\n it is possible that cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach strikes a better balance among these competing considerations than the current approach. however, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 analysis provides little reason to be confident that this is the case. cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 qualitative discussion of the proposed changes essentially ignores the concern that reducing the size of the regional adjustment could weaken participating aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s incentive to reduce spending or discourage expansion by low-spending acos. similarly, the regulatory impact analysis, which is the main evidence cms provides in favor of making this change, appears to assume that reducing the size of the regional adjustment would have no effect on performance by participating acos. this assumption is implausible and is likely to lead cms to understate the appropriate size of the regional adjustment. cms should remedy these flaws in its analysis and, if merited, modify its proposals accordingly.\n\n it is feasible to modify cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 analysis to account for how the regional adjustment affects acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 marginal incentives to reduce spending. specifically, cms could estimate how the present value of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s expected shared savings (or shared losses) change when the aco reduces spending by a dollar\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6incorporating both the contemporaneous increase in shared savings (or reduction in shared losses) and the reduction in future shared savings (or increase in shared losses) due to lower benchmarks\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6and examine how this marginal return varies across benchmarking methodologies.\n these marginal returns could be estimated under varying assumptions about how much acos discount future cash flows. cms could then adjust the amount acos are expected to reduce spending under different policy scenarios based on the differences in this marginal return across benchmarking methodologies. a reasonable baseline assumption is that the amount acos will reduce spending is roughly proportional to the expected marginal return to reducing spending, but cms should examine alternative assumptions as well.\n\n economic theory and the available evidence provide less guidance on how to account for the possibility that the regional adjustment might promote expansion by more efficient acos.\n however, this is not a justification for simply assuming that these effects do not exist. in light of\n\n\n 4 this phenomenon reflects that fact that high spending in any particular period typically reflects a combination of persistent factors, like inefficient care patterns and patient population differences, and transient \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3bad luck,\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 like an idiosyncratic expensive case.\n\n 5 selective participation is mitigated to some degree by the bonus for participation in advanced alternative payment models under the quality payment program, but that bonus would have to be much larger to eliminate these concerns entirely.\n\n the substantial uncertainty, cms could conduct analyses under a range of assumptions about how changes in an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s expected shared savings affect its market share.\n\n stepping beyond the current proposal, cms should consider alternative modifications to the benchmarking methodology that could ameliorate the main downsides of the existing regional adjustment (specifically, reduced participation by high-spending acos) without undermining acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 incentives to reduce spending. namely, cms could construct all or part of an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark by trending forward the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark from its first agreement period using some growth rate unrelated to the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own performance; michael mcwilliams, michael chernew, and bruce landon propose this approach in their comment letter on this proposed rule.\u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u0096\u0091 like the regional adjustment, this approach would break the link between an acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 current performance and its future benchmarks, thereby ensuring acos have strong incentives to reduce spending.\n however, it would offer higher benchmarks to historically high spending acos than the existing regional adjustment methodology, thereby encouraging those acos to participate in the mssp, while limiting windfalls to historically low spending acos.\n\n an ideal approach would likely combine the existing benchmarking approach with the approach proposed by mcwilliams, chernew, and landon. specifically, a portion of an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark would be set by trending forward the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark from is first agreement period, and a portion would be set based on average spending in the acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 region. the weight placed on regional average spending would be based on: (1) the amount the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s spending is expected to have reverted toward the mean since the benchmark period associated with the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period; (2) the extent to which historically high-spending acos are expected to be more successful in reducing spending than low-spending acos; and (3) an additional amount to encourage historically low-spending acos to expand to serve additional patients. because the expected amount of mean reversion is likely to rise over time, the appropriate weight on the regional average component would likely rise over time as well. if desired, some weight could also be placed on a traditional rebased benchmark in the long run. the appropriate weight on the traditional rebased benchmark would depend on the appropriate balance between ensuring strong incentives at the margin and ensuring broad participation by acos at different spending levels.\n\n cms considered approaches similar to those proposed by mcwilliams, chernew, and landon in the rulemaking establishing the current benchmarking methodology, but rejected them.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 cms expressed concern about locking in historical spending differences for the indefinite future, as well as concerns regarding how to adjust for changes in aco composition over time. the latter concern can be addressed by rebalancing the weight between the trended component of the benchmark and the regional average component of the benchmark over time, as suggested above. additionally, the comment letter by mcwilliams, chernew, and landon describes methods for addressing changes in aco composition that should be sufficient to largely address these concerns.\n\n summary of recommendations: cms should redo its analysis of these proposed changes to account for main downsides of curtailing the regional adjustment, notably weakening incentives for acos to reduce spending and discouraging efficient acos from expanding. based on the\n\n\n 6 the comment by mcwilliams, chernew, and landon is available at https://hmrlab.hcp.med.harvard.edu/files/hmrtest2/files/comment_on_mssp_proposed_rule_cms-1701-p_- _mewilliams_chernew_landon_01.pdf.\n\n 781 cfr 38011\n results from that improved analysis, cms should reconsider whether its proposed changes appropriately balance the competing objectives of the regional adjustment. cms should also consider alternative changes to the benchmarking methodology that could encourage participation by historically high-spending acos without undermining incentives to reduce spending.\n\n implementing a national-regional blend for calculating trend factors (section ii.d.3.d of the nprm)\n\n cms generally uses regional spending growth rates to derive the trend factors used in two parts of the benchmarking calculations: combining data from the three years of the benchmark period and trending the benchmark forward to each performance period.* regional trend factors have important advantages relative to the national trend factors cms has used in the past since they account for region-specific changes in practice patterns, socioeconomic factors, and other variables that may influence an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s spending performance. this reduces the amount of \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3noise\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 in acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 measured performance, which may make mssp participation more attractive. it also makes mssp participation more attractive to acos in regions where spending growth is expected to exceed national spending growth, while curtailing windfalls to acos in regions where spending growth is expected to be slower than national spending growth.\n\n however, as cms notes in the proposed rule, in instances where an aco accounts for a large fraction of all medicare beneficiaries in its region, an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own performance can have an excessive influence on the regional trend factors. this fact can, in turn, substantially weaken an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s incentive to reduce spending because an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s success in reducing spending translates into a lower regional trend factor and, thus, a lower benchmark, thereby keeping the aco from getting full credit for the savings it achieved. for example, for an aco that accounted for 40 percent of the beneficiaries in its region, reducing spending by a dollar will reduce the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark by around 40 cents, so the aco will only receive credit for 60 cents of savings. cms proposes to address this problem by using trend factors based on a blend of national and regional growth rates, with the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s weighted average penetration in its service area determining the weight placed on the national growth rates.\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach would likely be an improvement over current practice, but cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach nevertheless has two key flaws. first, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach only partially solves the problem at hand. consider once again an aco that accounts for 40 percent of the beneficiaries in its region. under cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal, national growth rates will receive a weight of only 40 percent in computing the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s trend factor, so the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own performance will still determine around 24 percent (=0.6 x 0.4) of the blended trend factor. as a result, if the aco reduces spending by a dollar, its benchmark will fall by around 24 cents, and it will receive credit for only around 76 cents of savings. thus, while cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed approach is an improvement relative to using the existing regional trend factors, much of the incentive problem remains.\n second, placing significant weight on national growth rates would result in a trend factor that does a worse job capturing the local spending trends facing an aco. indeed, as noted above, the original reason for adopting regional trend factors was to better capture these local trends.\n\n\n\n 8 the exception is an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period, when cms currently uses national trend factors. however, as discussed below, cms is proposing to switch to regional trend factors in this rule.\n\n 10\n in light of these shortcomings, a better approach would be to exclude each aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries when computing regional trend factors. this approach would entirely eliminate the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s influence on its own trend factor. this approach would also completely (or almost completely) preserve the benefits of using regional trend factors in benchmarking calculations.\n\n the proposed rule cites three reasons for rejecting this alternative approach, but each of cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 concerns is either readily addressed or misplaced. first, cms argues that the number of enrollees in an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s service area that are not affiliated with the aco may sometimes be too small to estimate a reliable trend factor; however, this problem can be easily addressed by incorporating information from adjacent or similar counties when population sizes are too small. second, cms argues that beneficiaries not affiliated with the aco may differ from those who are affiliated with the aco; however, this problem affects virtually any conceivable trend methodology, including cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed national-regional blend, so it does not provide a basis for rejecting this methodology in particular. third, cms argues that acos may try to attract healthier enrollees and drive away sicker enrollees in order to manipulate the trend factor; however, these types of risk selection incentives are inherent in the aco program and, as in other settings, the best policy response is to operate an effective risk adjustment program.\n\n as a final note, while cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal focuses on how an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s performance affects the trend factors used during an agreement period, an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own performance also affects the regional spending average used to compute the regional adjustment to its benchmark for future agreement periods. including the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries in the regional average used to compute the regional adjustment undermines one of the main objectives of the regional adjustment, which is to (partially) break the link between the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s current performance and its future benchmarks. for this reason, cms should also exclude an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries from the regional spending average used to compute the regional adjustment at the start of an agreement period.\n\n summary of recommendations: rather than adopting trend factors based on a national-regional blend, cms should continue to use purely regional trend factors, but exclude an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries when computing those trend factors. in cases where an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s service area does not include enough enrollees not aligned with the aco to compute reliable trend factors, cms should include data from adjacent or otherwise similar counties. cms should also exclude an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries when computing the regional spending average used to compute the regional adjustment to an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark at the start of an agreement period.\n\n using regional factors during an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period (section ii.d.3.b of the nprm)\n\n as described above, after an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period, cms uses regional trend factors to combine data from the benchmark years and to update the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark during an agreement period, and cms implements a regional adjustment when establishing an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark. in contrast, cms currently uses national trend factors and does not make a regional adjustment in benchmark calculations for an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period. in this proposed rule, cms proposes to begin using regional trend factors and making a regional adjustment in benchmark calculations for an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period.\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to adopt regional trend factors during an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement periods is a good\none. the advantages of using regional trend factors discussed above apply just as strongly to first\n agreement periods as to subsequent agreement periods. using the same trend factors across all agreement periods will also simplify the benchmarking methodology, as cms notes.\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to implement a regional adjustment during an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period also has merit, but cms should do additional analysis to determine the appropriate size of the adjustment. the rationale for implementing a regional adjustment is markedly different in an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period than in later agreement periods. in particular, as discussed above, the most important rationale for a regional adjustment in later agreement periods is to reduce the link between an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s current performance and its future benchmarks, thereby strengthening the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s incentive to reduce spending. that rationale is not relevant to an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period (unless the behavior of non-aco providers is shaped by the possibility that they might choose to join an aco in the future, which is likely not a significant issue in practice).\n\n rather, the most important rationale for a regional adjustment in an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement period is to account for mean reversion, the tendency of high-spending acos to experience below- average spending growth and low-spending acos to experience above-average spending growth in subsequent years. the appropriate weight to place on the regional adjustment in an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s initial agreement period thus should reflect the amount of mean reversion actually experienced by acos, plus possibly a modest additional amount to reflect the potential benefits of encouraging relatively low-spending acos to expand their market shares. cms should do an analysis to estimate the amount of mean reversion in acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 spending and set the weight placed on the regional adjustment in a first agreement period accordingly.\n\n summary of recommendations: cms should finalize its proposal to use regional trend factors when establishing and updating an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark during its first agreement period. cms should also finalize its proposal to apply a regional adjustment when establishing an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark for a first agreement period, but it should conduct additional analysis to determine the appropriate size of that regional adjustment.\n\n thank you for the opportunity to comment on cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed rule.

administrator verma:\n the  american  psychiatric  association,  the  national medical  society  representing  more than 37,800 psychiatric physicians, appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  proposed  rule, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedicare  program;  medicare  shared  savings  program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  specifically, the apa would like to provide cms with information regarding telepsychiatry research and clinical practice in  response  to  the  elements of  the  proposed  rule  regarding  the  expansion  of reimbursement for telehealth services within medicare acos.\n overall, the apa is supportive of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand telehealth reimbursement by waiving certain geographic and originating site restrictions, allowing patients to be seen in their homes by psychiatrists practicing at a distance, regardless of whether they reside in a health professional shortage area (hpsa).  these two restrictions have historically been barriers to access to quality psychiatric care for medicare beneficiaries, resulting in the limited  use  of  much-needed  mental  health  services.    telepsychiatry  has  seen  a significant  uptick  in  use  among  clinicians  over  the  past  decade  and  an  ever-growing evidence base suggests that treatment via telepsychiatry demonstrates similar outcomes to  in-person  care  and,  in  some  cases,  better  outcomes\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially  with  certain populations, cultural groups, or clinical diagnoses.1,2\n telepsychiatry can also help to mitigate the stigma around seeking treatment for mental health conditions (in rural and urban locations alike) and can also be used to address the geographic  and  numeric  maldistribution  of  psychiatrists  across  the  united  states. eliminating the originating site and geographic requirements not only benefits patients with limited access to a psychiatrist in rural communities, but also for those who reside in  urban  areas  whose  physical or  psychiatric  diagnoses make  it  difficult  to  leave  their homes to visit the doctor.\n\n\n\n while the cost associated with expanding telehealth reimbursement in medicare has been a concern of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for some time, the apa would like to highlight that the cost of untreated mental illnesses, including substance abuse, should also be factored into the bigger picture of providing better access to mental healthcare to beneficiaries.  the current disease burden of mental illnesses and substance use disorders in the united states is very high, with 44.7 million adults experiencing a mental illness at any given time,\n20.1 million with a substance use disorder, and 3.4 million with comorbid mental illness/substance use \n disorder diagnoses.  the economic impact of these illnesses left untreated is also very high, with about\n$38.5 billion in emergency room care,3 $132.6 - $351 billion in those who have medical comorbidities with \n mental  illness,4 and  $193.2  billion  in  lost  productivity.5  improving  access  to  mental  health  services through telepsychiatry, which is proven to be as effective as in-person care, has the potential to alleviate the cost of untreated mental illness. the apa appreciates the opportunity to provide these comments to cms.  for more information about apa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work around telepsychiatry, please visit http://www.psychiatry.org/teletoolkit.  if you should have any questions or

current medicare shared savings program (mssp) beneficiary assignment regulations, an np is an authorized aco professional, but their patients cannot be assigned to the aco unless they receive one primary care service from a primary care physician participating with the aco each year. this has inhibited np practices from joining or establishing shared savings aco's and limited the scope of the shared savings program (mssp). if the mssp is to continue to develop and improve patient access, quality and cost effectiveness, it must be fully inclusive of nps and their patients.\r\n\r\ntherefore, i support cms' proposal to update the voluntary alignment option for beneficiary assignment in the shared savings program (mssp). this proposal would allow a patient to choose an np as their primary shared savings aco clinician and be assigned to an mssp aco without requiring a primary care service from a primary care physician. this proposal will increase the participation of nps and their

dear administrator verma: mayo clinic respectfully provides comments to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) on its proposed rule cms-1701-p medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pathways to success. mayo clinic is a not-for-profit physician led and physician driven health care system dedicated to medical care, research and education. with over 8,000 eligible clinicians (ec), 20 hospitals and 60,000 employees, mayo clinic demonstrates a 150 year commitment to excellence which has spawned a rich history of health care innovation. each year, more than one million people from all 50 states and 140 countries come to mayo clinic to receive the highest quality care at sites in minnesota, arizona and florida. in addition, mayo clinic health system, a family of clinics, hospitals and health care facilities, serves communities in iowa, minnesota and wisconsin. we respectfully submit the following comments to this proposed rule. over the past several years, we have undertaken an effort to begin to transition the mayo clinic from fee-for-service to pay-for-performance, and ultimately alternative payment model participation. this journey has involved careful planning and decision-making, charting a course toward greater levels of risk over time. the organization has successfully participated in the merit-based incentive payment system (mips) within the quality payment program as a result of careful planning and implementation of that program and we recently began participation in the bundled payments for care initiative advanced (bpci-a) program. we recognize that fee-for-service is time-limited which necessitates a move to alternative payment models across all payer types, including traditional medicare. with that ultimate goal in mind, we are carefully evaluating and considering our participation in the medicare shared savings program (mssp) accountable care organization (aco) program. based on our review of this program, we ask that you prioritize three important changes to the proposed rule:\ni. adjust the beneficiary attribution methodology to ensure that the appropriate patients are assigned \n to the aco.\nii. increase the shared savings percentages for mssp participants in the basic track across all 5 years. \n\niii. implement a fair risk adjustment methodology that accurately accounts for changes in the \n organizations such as mayo clinic are comfortable assuming risk if attributed populations represent those patients for whom they are truly accountable and if patient hcc scores are accurately tabulated and calculated for risk scoring by cms based on information both internal and external to the aco. we believe that with some modification, the mssp program, as proposed, could provide an important on-ramp and glide path for organizations like ours to move into downside risk arrangements over time. our detailed comments are provided below.\ni. \u0000 beneficiary attribution methodology \n mayo clinic supports aco choice in medicare beneficiary attribution methods to include both prospective and retrospective methods. however, we suggest that cms align its processes on beneficiary attribution to those in other programs making certain that organizations have a seamless approach to aco participation. for instance, the 2019 medicare physician fee schedule proposed rule includes language that will enable physicians and advance practice providers (nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and physician assistants) to soon receive credit for the evaluation and management services provided to patients under the same multispecialty organization. mayo clinic requests that cms adopt mssp-aco attribution processes similar to those proposed through the calendar year 2019 medicare physician fee schedule (mpfs) proposed rule allowing distinction on primary care advance practice provider (app) vs. specialty app. in prior years cms would deny multiple claims by advanced practice providers (apps), under the same organizational national provider identifier (npi) and tax identification number (tin), even if that practitioner was working in a different specialty. this created situations where claims were not tabulated by carriers for services provided in integrated settings. under the proposed rule for mpfs, these providers will now have claims processed by the carriers and carriers will recognize the primary care and specialty practice of the app. carriers have already begun to provide direction to providers and institutions on how to soon identify the specialty of the app since the medicare provider enrollment process has never accounted for the true app specialty practice unlike physicians. the benefit will be a reduction in claims-based attribution skewing occurring for integrated organizations. patients will be linked to their primary care app providing the plurality of evaluation and management services vs. the specialist. primary care providers are more than willing to accept responsibility for their attributed patients as long as the provider is truly the one responsible for overarching coordination of care and referral to specialists. mayo clinic also recommends that cms allow acos to submit individual provider npis for attribution purposes as opposed to utilizing all providers under the aco tin. not every aco provider under the tin is a primary care provider for patients or a provider seeing a population-based panel. we also encourage cms to explore other options for medicare beneficiary attribution assessment similar to those adopted by state agencies that often use an approach that includes exclusion, attribution, and tie-breaking steps to support a valid beneficiary population. the process includes an analysis of external claims, internal claims, and e/m claims by primary care and specialty providers within an organization. exclusion criteria are also used for those beneficiaries who do not have an historical relationship with the organization and where a utilization pattern of services cannot be clearly established for the patient. mayo clinic also noted that the proposed designated primary care-related services (evaluation and management services) for beneficiary attribution purposes does not include the initial preventive physical examination (ippe) or annual wellness visit (awv) to the list of applicable services. mayo clinic highly encourages cms to add these two services to the list as these services are most often provided by the primary healthcare provider for the medicare beneficiary and they are significant to accurate attribution.\n11. \u0000 shared sayings \n uncommon to take longer than 2 participation years to implement meaningful changes in its healthcare delivery model and provider and patient populations. requiring acos to transition to higher risk sharing models beginning with basic track level c could have unintended consequences negating the original intent of cms quality payment programs. mayo clinic encourages cms to increase shared savings in its basic track levels a and b to 50 percent, at a minimum, for inexperienced new entrants given significant infrastructure investments a new aco has to make in the early years; levels c and d to 55 percent; and level e to 60 percent with a goal of 75 percent shared savings by enhanced track achievement.\niii. \u0000 risk adjustment methodology \n\n", "0208": "see attached file(s) seema verma administrator centers for medicare & medicaid services

medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations- pathways to success [cms-1701-p]\n dear administrator verma,\n this letter serves to provide comments on the centers for medicare & medicaid services proposed rule that would redesign the medicare shared savings program, encouraging organizations to transition to two-sided risk models. the rio grande valley health alliance, llc (rgvha) has embraced the migration to risk and currently participates in track 3 with our current contract set to expire december 31, 2018.\n overall, we support the redesign of the medicare shared savings program and congratulate you and cms for setting the path towards achieving a more measurable move to value, demonstrating savings to the medicare program, and promoting a competitive and accountable marketplace.\n while we recognize the need for transformation and change, we urge you to consider the potentially negative effects this proposed rule will have on our organization and others.  as an early adopter of the aco model, our small primary care led aco, has saved over 43 million and maintained an average quality score of 97%.  the physicians in our organization strive for accountability in cost and quality and foster an organization of transparency.\n our success has been a journey of learning and adapting; it has taken time, effort, and buy-in to foster the culture of accountable medicine.  we believe any transformation should be completed with care, dignity, and respect for both current acos and prospective acos.\n it is of the upmost importance to note, had some of the proposals existed in 2013, we most certainly would not have had the resources or capability to grow towards the risk bearing, successful organization we are today.  based on our six-year experience as a medicare shared savings program aco, we respectfully recommend/support the following:\n ins, this option allows greater ability to manage the population truly receiving care by our primary care physicians and will ensure our panel remains above the 5,000 thresholds.\n monitoring financial performance in the proposal, cms is recommending proceeding with early termination for any aco that has a negative performance outside the corridor for 2 performance years.  this is unreasonable. acos should have an opportunity to establish a corrective action plan.  additionally, due to the timing of receipt of final reconciliation, an aco will not have enough time to make and implement adjustments.  it is important for an aco to have the final reconciliation information to make decisions, because final benchmarks can increase or decrease (which is not always predicable).  for example: the aco receives its year 1 final performance reports in august of year 2 and finds out their losses are outside the corridor.  the aco may have insufficient time to affect year 2 performance.  it will be able to initiate a corrective action plan for the remainder of year 2 and for the full year 3.  if it has losses outside the corridor in year 2, the aco will receive this final information in august of year 3.  the full accounting of the results of the corrective action plan will be assessed in august of year 4.  also, quarterly data should not be used for the determination of financial performance due to the natural seasonal variations in health care spending and utilization.  due to the natural time frame to implement and assess corrective actions, we recommend non-renewal of the next contract cycle rather than early termination.\n aco repayment mechanism for acos in two-sided model termination voluntary early termination - if the aco voluntarily terminates from the mssp program, the aco should be held responsible for a prorated repayment based on the date of termination.\n involuntary termination (terminated by cms) -if cms terminates an aco, the aco should not be held responsible for any losses.  the aco was willing to continue to participate and meet obligations, but cms chose to terminate. therefore, it should be cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responsibility to address the loss.\n participation tracks election of msr/mlr by acos we agree with the proposal to offer acos in a two-sided model the option to choose msr/mlr.\n we suggest the basic track one-sided model have the msr modified to a fixed 2% msr for 5,000+ beneficiaries and utilize a variable msr for below 5,000 beneficiaries.\n basic level e track vs. enhanced track rgvha supports the decision to redesign the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation options by offering two eligible tracks. however, we are opposed to the unbalanced level of risk required when comparing basic level e and enhanced track. basic level e track is designed appropriately, but the enhanced track is simply unbearable.\n certainly be more attractive to those not only wanting to join the aco movement of improving healthcare and reducing costs, but also moving forward from the basic track to the enhanced model.\n this is especially true for physician-owned entities.  physician led acos have historically shown the greatest success in the program, but the current loss potential would be crippling to an organization such as ours.\n we have participated in the track 3 model and are accustomed with bearing risk. we share yours and cms opinion that all acos should eventually assume risk.  unfortunately, due to the proposed rules, we are forced to rethink strategically and operationally, both of which cause financial burden.  we urge cms to provide a softer downside risk that facilitates proper investment and enough cushion in the benchmark that allows for additional revenue to be created.\n please see table below with hypothetical examples of the disparity in risk between basic track level e and enhanced track\n basic track - level e enhanced track beneficiaries max savings max shared savings max loss payment repayment mechanism beneficiaries max savings max shared savings max loss payment repayment mechanism 10,000 24 mil 12 mil *480k 120k 10,000 32 mil 24 mil 18 mil 1.2 mil 20,000 48 mil 24 mil 960k 240k 20,000 64 mil 48 mil 36 mil 2.4

modifying the repayment mechanism tail to 12 months from the end of the last performance year.  12 months will meet the run-out time for final reconciliation and payment of any associated losses.\n re-insurance this is an established health care industry standard to address downside risk.  re-insurance should be an acceptable option for paying back losses associated with taking risk.  it is common practice for health insurance plans and should be an acceptable method for acos.\n this is not an issue of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaming\u00e2\u0080\u009d the system.  it is a prudent practice to have stop loss/re- insurance to address unexpected risk.  furthermore, it would support acos to participate in the enhanced track because the downside risk would not be unendurable.  acos need additional methods to repay losses.\n cms should allow acos taking risk to obtain and maintain insurance coverage to address losses.\n participation agreement periods due to the significant revisions contained in the proposed rule, we agree with cms to cancel the 2018 application cycle.  however, we strongly urge cms to commence the pathway to success program as of january 1, 2020.  acos with agreements set to expire as of december 31, 2018, should be offered the opportunity to extend that agreement by renewing for a fourth performance full year, which should last twelve months from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019. under the proposed rule, having two separate performance years, january 1 through june 30 under current mssp and then july 1 through december 31 under the new pathways to success, would be extremely burdening not only for cms but for acos as well.  managing and implementing necessary modifications to operational processes for two different sets of populations to meet program and organization expectations in one year would be considerably taxing and overall challenging.  moreover, receiving separate reconciliation reports for the two performance periods only adds to the complexity of the program, including the deciphering of appropriate financial distributions, if applicable.\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements snf 3 day waiver we agree with the proposal to expand eligibility for the snf 3-day waiver rule to include acos participating in a two-sided model under preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation.  additionally, while we understand that the quality of snf selection must be maintained, we suggest a re-evaluation of the indicators that qualify snfs to be included in the application acceptance criteria. in many areas of the country, including rural areas, snfs which successfully maintain a rating of 3 or more stars, as currently required, are limited.  this makes it difficult to utilize the waiver to its fullest potential. perhaps focusing on a certain category(s) under the cms 5-star quality rating system as reported on the nursing home compare website instead of an overall rating or including other ratings and qualifications may help with the successful utilization of the waiver.\n telehealth we agree that eligible physicians and practitioners in acos under performance-based risk and prospective assignment can receive payment for telehealth services furnished to prospectively assigned beneficiaries.  we recommend cms include acos participating in a two-sided model under preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation as eligible for the telehealth waiver.  thus, aco eligibility will be the same for both the snf and telehealth waivers.  it will create consistency and be more streamlined for cms to manage.\n beneficiary incentives we agree with cms. it will be beneficial to provide a mechanism for acos to offer beneficiary incentive programs.\n and its potential.  we think it is possible to set up appropriate boundaries and accounting mechanisms for any outside funds that they could be used judiciously.  if cms allows outside funds to be used, we expect the aco to have a public disclosure of the funding source(s).\n additional waivers / beneficiary enhancements we strongly encourage cms allow additional resources to better manage our high cost/complex patients. we suggest allowing acos to have a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgatekeeper\u00e2\u0080\u009d option with preauthorization needed for patients to see specialists or other primary care physicians outside the aco network. without the ability for the aco to create a network of preferred physicians and facilities it is unreasonable for cms to require the aco to be responsible for losses out of its control.\n beneficiary opt-in based on assignment methodology medicare advantage plan rgvha operates in a highly competitive medicare advantage plan region.  we have upwards of 15% leakage during each performance year.  we ask cms to level the playing field and allow mssp acos the appropriate flexibility and resources to retain beneficiaries to provide better care and demonstrate better outcomes.\n voluntary alignment we support the process of voluntarily alignment however, some of our offices have found the process burdensome.  rgvha proposes allowing for opt-in by telephone, mailing, and at the point of care in the physician office in addition to the current electronic method.\n opt-in enrollment process although an opt-in enrollment is a valuable idea and utilized by health plans, many acos do not have the infrastructure or the staff necessary to effectively operate such a process.  we urge medicare to provide acos with the same resources and funding allowed of managed care organizations to successfully run a marketing/patient opt-in program.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d hybrid approach rgvha partially supports a hybrid approach that would supplement an \u00e2\u0080\u009copt in\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach with a modified claims-based assignment approach that focuses on the most complex patients, such as high-risk patients or those receiving care for chronic conditions. this approach would only be successful with a closed/narrow network. assigning complex, high risk patients would only be supported if the aco provider is indeed the pcp and the pcp is actively involved in the patients care.  a gatekeeper model should be enforced in conjunction to this proposal to ensure the primary care physician is at the center of the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care\n benchmark cms-hcc risk scores newly and continuously assigned beneficiary distinction - we agree with removing this distinction.\n contract cycle.  with moving to a 5-year contract cycle, we recommend consideration of an asymmetrical cap, such as 3% downward and a 10% upward cap to be phased in over the 5-year contract cycle.  this will account for the aging of the population and natural progression of disease over the 5-year contract.  example: year 1 (3% down / 3% up); year 2 (3% down / 4% up); year 3 (3% down / 6% up); year 4 (3% down / 8% up); year 5 (3% down / 10% up).\n 5% regional adjustment cap rgvha opposes capping the regional adjustment amount using a flat dollar amount equal to 5 percent of national medicare ffs per capita expenditures. while we understand the rational to attempt to mitigate the effects of excessive positive or negative regional adjustments used to establish and reset the benchmark, we believe long term it will benefit the region in leveling cost as more organizations transition to value-based care. it will also provide an incentive for organizations above the regional expenditures to decrease costs and conversely, low cost organizations in the region to join the effort toward value-based care.  rgvha proposes the regional adjustment cap of 10 percent of the national medicare ffs per capita expenditures.\n thank you again for your work on behalf of patients and providers to advance value-based payment. we appreciate your interest in sustaining the success of medicare acos and creating an environment where providers are encouraged to enter into value-based payment arrangements and help patients receive high-quality, coordinate care.\n we are grateful for the opportunity to submit these

to improve health care quality for medicare beneficiaries in a way that sustainably increases savings for medicare trust funds.\n\n bpc health policy leaders have released dozens of recommendations in

of bpc\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s founders or board of directors.\n\n cms has proposed to redesign the mssp so as to encourage participation in successful pathways, while removing components of the program which serve to hinder the transition to value-based care. pathways to success proposes to advance risk-sharing and while working to maintain the incentive to participate in the model. several of the major provisions touch on issues core to the work of the bpc health project. the bpc health project developed a white paper in january 2015 specifically aimed at improving acos!. many of our positions regarding this value-based model continue to be relevant.\n\n the current flexibilities afforded acos have led to a majority of one-sided risk arrangements. however, the cms review of aco performance over the past several years has shown that acos bearing two- sided risk, and those that were low-volume (generally, physician-led), were most successful in generating cost savings while improving quality. in fact, acos bearing only upside risk incurred costs greater than the benchmark. based on the success of the track 1+ model designed by the innovation center and reluctance of current track 1 acos to accept the high level of risk in track 2 and 3, cms has proposed a redesign of the pathways. the current aco pathways would be retired and replaced with a basic \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3glide\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 path and an enhanced pathway, each with a minimum agreement period of 5 years.\n the pathway of an aco will be determined by the level of experience in the model and its time in an upside-only arrangement will be minimized. the basic path would begin as upside-only risk for a maximum of two years, followed by a yearly, progressive increase in downside-risk responsibility. the highest basic level and the enhanced track, based on the current track 3, would qualify as advanced apms under the quality payment program. speeding up the path to full risk will decrease unnecessary spending, while quality measures continue to ensure efficiency and sufficient provision of care. bpc strongly supports the move to shared risk as a means to significant savings and meaningful quality improvements.\n\n along with this proposal to increase risk, cms introduced a decrease in potential shared savings. shared savings in the upside-risk year(s), would be twenty-five percent, half of the current track 1 model. the current fifty percent shared savings would be applied for acos at the maximum basic risk level. the decrease in shared savings may discourage some program participants. the new potential returns, when weigh against upfront investments, may be of concern to participants. this is a particularly salient issue for experienced acos that would be placed in the enhanced track. however, the protection of the medicare trust through cost-saving measures must be balanced with program attrition. bpc encourages the administration to seek ways to minimize attrition, while remaining committed to full risk.\n\n\n\n 1 bipartisan policy center, \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3transitioning to organized systems of

bipartisanpolicy.org\n beneficiary engagement was also addressed in the rule. quality measures continue to be process-based, creating difficulties in applying free-market principles. by allowing the patient to \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3opt-in\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 to a particular aco, choose an assigned provider, and receive incentives from the aco, consumer-driven activities will supplement the current measures of quality and value. bpc supports the active engagement of beneficiaries.\n\n the administration has continued to solicit stakeholder input on the regulatory burdens affecting all stakeholders within the health care system. through patients over paperwork, we have seen an active push to lessen administrative work and remove hurdles to medicare participation. while this burden reduction may increase participation in value-based programs, the anti-kickback and stark statutes are important legislative roadblocks that restrict to full care coordination. these protections to prevent inappropriate fee-for-service utilization are ill-suited for value-based care models. bpc encourages the expansion of anti-kickback safe-harbors and stark exceptions.\n\n concerns of monetary risk that may deter participation can be suppressed by incentives for program participation. nevertheless, the transition from volume to value requires a level of financial accountability. synergizing the disparate forces for improved quality and cost containment continues to require disruptive models and innovative solutions. bpc will continue to support these actions through legislative and regulatory efforts to increase fiscally sustainable access to quality care.\n\n sincerely,\n g. william hoagland katherine hayes, j.d.\n senior vice president director,

improving the mssp program\nappreciate proposals such as positive adjustments to risk adjustment, incorporating regional expenditures into benchmark, expansion of waivers\ncritical that cms address three major concerns areas in the rule\nincreasing the shared savings rate\nslowing the transition to risk by allowing 3-4 years in upside only level for new acos\neliminating the distinction of high and low revenue acos\ncms should provide more flexibility to acos as they take on additional downside risk\ncms should incorporate approaches from next gen into mssp higher risk tracks: choice of enrolling tin or npi, infrastructure payment, prepayment of shared savings, primary care capitation\nredesigning participation options to facilitate performance-based risk\nproposals for modified participation options under 5-year agreement periods\nsupport 5-year agreement period; adds stability to program and allow aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to see impact of their efforts\ncreating a basic track with glide path to performance-based risk\nphase-in of performance risk in basic track\nthis progression to two-sided risk is far too aggressive and will deter participation.\nnumerous studies show that acos require about 3-4 years to become successful\nimplementing care processes that ensure success under a risk-based reimbursement model requires a significant investment of time, money, and administrative effort.\u00e2\u00a0 while we understand the need to transition to a risk-based method of reimbursement, accelerating this timeframe disrupts ongoing long-term strategies aimed at sustainably creating these care processes.\nthis is especially true for acos approaching the end of their first agreement period.\nmany of these acos will be forced to assume risk a year and a half earlier than expected.\nthis year and a half, while critical for health systems, may not significantly impact the federal government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term strategy of reducing healthcare spending.\nupdates to rules like the physician fee schedule are only now beginning to create a sustainable economic model for services like telehealth that can improve the quality of care while reducing cost.\u00e2\u00a0 the transition to risk should be supported by new billing codes that can sustainably allow for the implementation of these services.\nfor acos in their first agreement period in track 1, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only had the benefit of understanding our performance in this program for two years, and only recently received final financial reconciliation report for the 2nd performance year.\nacos in their first agreement period did not have the benefit of understanding what regional adjustment to our benchmark would mean for us\nfinally, 2017 was the first performance year in the quality payment program.\u00e2\u00a0 there are many areas of overlap between the qpp and the aco. we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a final qpp score for 2017 (secondary to the target review process). \u00e2\u00a0this creates challenges in arriving at a decision regarding whether to continue in the aco program or pursue the mips route\nrecommendation: allow 3-4 years of no downside risk\ncms could set parameters for successful acos to continue in a one-sided model for additional years (i.e. a fourth or fifth year for acos achieving savings, not necessarily shared savings, and high quality)\nshared savings\nlowering the shared-savings rate for acos with no downside risk from 50% to 25% makes the program significantly less attractive\nthis provides little incentive for new acos to join the program, it does not provide a sound business plan for organizations to enter a model that quickly transitions to risk\nthe low shared savings rate also does not take into account the investment needed on the part of both high and low-revenue acos. the investment required to put in place and sustain the elements necessary for a successful acos has been $11.6 to $26.1 million higher than previous estimates by cms, according to an analysis by the aha. these costs, coupled with the cost of having a repayment mechanism in place to cover losses, creates a high hurdle for organizations who are transitioning to accountable care.\nthe proposed shared savings rate is a significant decrease for existing acos, which will be unable to reinvest savings back into population management and care coordination. shared savings payments are critical as part of the transformation toward value-based care and are necessary to incentivize providers to make the infrastructure investments needed to transform care delivery and processes. without them, acos will struggle to provide care and services needed to appropriately manage the health of the population and move more rapidly to risk, undermining the overall goal of the program.\nreducing shared savings also produces problems with provider participation and buy-in in acos, as some organizations already find this difficult at current shared savings level.\nrecommendation: cms should maintain the current 50% shared savings rate for acos with no downside risk\nincreasing shared-savings rate as acos take on additional risk\nsupport that the shared savings rate increases as acos take on more risk in the basic glidepath\ncalculation of loss sharing limit\nsupport using lower of revenue-based or historical benchmark based\nin track e the level of risk should be exactly the nominal risk standard under qpp\nspecifically, the benchmark-based level of risk should be 3% rather than 4%\ncms provides no rationale for setting the benchmark-based loss limit at the nominal risk standard plus one percentage point\ntrack e set to meet the of an aapm,\nincreasing the benchmark-based loss limit creates an unlevel playing field for acos that include hospital participants\nacos with hospital participants will always use the historical-based benchmark since part a/b revenue will far exceed the historic benchmark\ncms should not unnecessarily subject acos with a hospital participant to additional risk.\ntrack e is designed to meet the qpp aapm requirements, the benchmark should align rather than being higher for acos with hospital participants\nstructuring the loss sharing limits so that acos with hospital participants have to take on more risk discourages acos from recruiting hospital participants\nthis is counter to the goal of acos to encourage various providers to work together to improve care\nthis approach discourages both health-system-led and physician-led acos from recruiting hospital participants\ntransition from level e to enhanced\nlevel e to enhanced is a significant increase in level of risk\ncms should create levels within the enhanced track to transition from level e to enhanced\npermitting annual participation elections\nelection of different levels of risk within basic glidepath\nrecommendation: if an aco selects a higher level of risk than it would have been automatically assigned, it should not be required to automatically advance the following year (i.e. an aco is not required to advance beyond the track they would have been assigned if they did not choose to advance to a higher track)\nacos may wish to move to a higher risk track and gain more experience there before moving to a track with even higher risk.\ncms could set parameters for successful acos to continue in a particular track prior to automatic advancing (i.e. achieving savings, not necessarily shared savings, and high quality)\nannual election of beneficiary assignment methodology- support\nparticipation options: medicare ffs revenue and prior participation\nlow-revenue vs. high-revenue acos\ndo not support any distinction between low-revenue and high-revenue acos\nunder the plan cms would require high-revenues to advance to the enhanced track after one year in basic-level e; conversely, low-revenue acos would be allowed a second agreement period in basic-level e\ncms argues that many low-revenue acos aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t well capitalized and unable to absorb losses\nregardless of structure, significant investments are needed in population health platforms and care process changes for acos to bear risk.\ncms is unable to identify if an aco is well capitalized through sources outside of medicare revenue (i.e. insurer or investor backed acos); cms is unable to truly identify whether an aco is well capitalized and should not create distinctions based on assumptions about capital\nsetting up a system that disadvantages hospital-led acos limits the types of innovations needed to build a high performing healthcare system for the range of communities across the nation.\nthe best way to drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate to innovate and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare.\nthis policy will simply lead to acos restructuring tins to avoid including hospital participants even if the hospital is actively involved in redesigning care processes to lower cost and improve quality of the aco population.\ncms approach for comparing revenue to expenditures disadvantages acos that treat more complex patients that have higher expenditures\nthe goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively.  including a hospital is an effective way to balance the need for access to specialty care while increasing the focus on primary care.  this should be about raising the bar for everyone and not disadvantaging one provider group over another\nrecommendations: cms should allow all acos to remain in track e or whatever track meets the nominal risk requirements under qpp\nif cms increases the qpp aapm nominal risk threshold, cms should create a glidepath in mssp for acos to transition to the new standard of risk\ncms seeks comments on greater potential reward for low-revenue acos\nas stated earlier cms should not create arbitrary distinctions for acos based on their medicare\nparticipation options based on prior participation\nrenewing/reentering- support definitions and 50% threshold\nexperienced- support definition; increase threshold from 40% to 50% to align with new/re-entering\nencourage cms to monitor these impact of this policy and consider creating an appeals process\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that two separate acos discontinue operation in a region then a new entity, completely unaffiliated with either prior entity, forms in the region and recruits participants involved in the prior organization\nthe intent of the policy is to avoid gaming of the options for the glidepath not to discourage new entities\ncms should also consider a second criteria, setting a threshold for a percentage of participants that all previously were in the same entity. for example, first identify if 50% of participants would qualify aco to be reentering or experienced; then if less than 30% of participants were a part of the same legal entity the aco could appeal the label of reentering or experienced\nmonitoring for financial performance\noppose cms policy to terminate acos if negative outside corridor for two agreement periods\ncms does not need to terminate acos if all are forced to move to two-sided risk\nif cms extends the time acos can remain in downside risk, this policy should be amended to terminate acos if they are negative outside corridor for three agreement periods\nrepayment for early termination\ndo not support proposal to set termination date to avoid repayment of losses at june 30\ndate to terminate without repaying losses should be 30 days after receipt of second quarter data; prior to this acos have insufficient information to make termination

one year or six-months\nif an aco significantly changes its participant list between the six-month extension and start of the new model the acos aligned beneficiaries could be significantly

program available when aco program results are released. this information will be useful to other acos as they consider implementation of the program\nempowering beneficiary choice: beneficiary notifications\nwe understand cms intent to provide beneficiaries with more information\nrequiring additional notification at the first primary care visit of the performance year introduces additional burden for clinicians participating in an aco\nimplementing this requirement would require the clinicians performing primary care visits to reformat their ehr systems to include reminder prompts and documentation of sharing this beneficiary information\nprior efforts to require acos to directly notify beneficiaries resulted in beneficiary confusion, many acos had to dedicate staff to answering questions after release of beneficiary notifications\ncms should first provide information to beneficiaries about the aco they are aligned with and the option to identify a primary doctor; then the aco could follow-up with targeted aco information. this sequencing will help reduce confusion for beneficiaries\nwhen acos disseminate information they should have the ability to provide information in the manner of beneficiary choice; for example if an beneficiary could opt to receive notifications via email\nempowering beneficiary choice:  opt-in assignment methodology\ncms should maintain the existing methodology and avoid replacing it with the hybrid methodology\ncms should test methods for beneficiaries directly opt-in to participating in an aco\nbenchmarking methodology

that risk scores should increase or decrease during the course of the agreement period; this recognizes that the beneficiary population underlying health changes with time\nthe cap of +/- 3% is too

that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest

\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3accountable care organizations \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 pathways to success\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 proposed rule. sutter health is deeply committed to the value based care model as the best path to deliver on our not for profit mission to improve the well-being of the communities we serve. we applaud the bold moves proposed in the pathways to success proposal. we appreciate the chance to comment on some features of the proposal that may have the unintended consequence of disincentivizing providers in efficient markets from further investments in risk-based arrangements, and have the potential to make medicare unsustainable for providers in these markets, leading to reduced access for beneficiaries. to address these challenges, we recommend:\n\n\n1. encouraging new acos through an extended one-sided risk period\n\n\n2. changes to benchmark methodology to better reflect the economic realities of\n providers in historically efficient markets\n\n3. adjustments to benchmark methodology to more accurately reflect quality based\n performance by removing the impact of current year cost adjustments\n\n4. encourage providers to care for complex patients by changing the risk adjustment\n methodology\n\n5. more equitable treatment of high volume acos to encourage their adoption of risk\n sharing models\n\n6. aglide path between the basic and enhanced tracks to allow providers adequate\n time to develop capabilities to manage the increased risk\n sutter health is an integrated, not-for-profit health care delivery system that spans across 22 counties in northern california, with 24 hospitals, more than 50,000 employees and over 5,000 aligned physicians. we serve over 3.4 million patients \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 nearly 1 percent of the u. s.\n population, in one of the most diverse and innovative regions of the world. america\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s physician groups (apg) awarded each of sutter health\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s five medical foundations elite status (five stars) in its 2017 national standards of excellence survey. the standards of excellence survey evaluates quality, care coordination and patient experience.\n\n sutter health supports enhancing value to patients and health care purchasers through focused incentives to improve quality, service, care coordination and efficiency. as an integrated system, we are particularly committed to advancing value in the provision of\n page 1 of 4 | sutterhealth.org\n health care services to our medicare beneficiaries. over 600,000 medicare beneficiaries\n(1.2% of all u.s. medicare beneficiaries) see sutter for their care. we are committed to\n providing value to cms, our providers and patients, and we support value-based programs, like accountable care organizations (acos).\n\n northern california as a whole performs well in the medicare program across multiple dimensions. northern california is one of the best value-based geographies in the nation as measured by quality of care, access to preventative services, innovation in care delivery (end of life alternatives, avoidance of unnecessary ed use and hospital readmissions, patient centered medical homes, etc.) or lowering the total per capita spend per beneficiary.\n ironically, our low per capita spend creates an incentive for most physicians and physician groups to choose mips over apm pathways due the benchmark methodology. sutter health participated in mips in 2017 and successfully received 100% of the mips composite score.\n unfortunately, this only translated to a 1.88% positive payment adjustment, versus the +4% opportunity proposed in the macra legislation. for the 2018 macra performance year, sutter health continues to invest in the quality services we provide to our patients and is participating in mips again.\n\n in the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3accountable care organizations \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 pathways to success\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 proposed rule there are structural issues which disproportionately impact efficient regions like northern california and large integrated systems like sutter health. we recognize cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 effort to streamline existing alternative payment model (apm) options into a simpler two-track approach and changing the benchmark methodology to include a blended regional/national trend factor.\n sutter health is concerned that while this change is a step in the right direction, both the basic and enhanced tracks are not designed to support high revenue, already efficient organizations and regions. in order to encourage organizations in already efficient regions to participate in an aco, we recommend the following changes:\n\n e extend the amount of time new acos can participate with no downside risk. in medicare shared savings program track 1, new acos had up to 6 years of no downside risk with the opportunity of receiving up to 50% shared savings. while we understand the intent to encourage providers to enter into risk arrangements, we are concerned the drastic decrease from 6 to 2 years of no downside risk with lower shared savings opportunity will result in providers exiting the program prematurely, or not participating at all. entering into a shared savings program requires substantial resources to build an infrastructure, analyze the population and apply appropriate population health management initiatives. with substantial risk and minimal shared savings opportunity, organizations will be discouraged from making the investments required to start an apm. the net result is contrary to cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 goals. in order to encourage adequate participation in the program, we recommend that cms extend the number of years new acos have no downside risk to at least 5 years, and increase the shared savings to the previous rate of 50%.\n\n e benchmark methodology should be modified to encourage organizations and providers in already efficient areas to participate in acos by utilizing national trends only. the current proposed rule holds organizations with historically low spending growth to a higher standard than those who are in high spending growth areas. it assumes that regions with slower growth will be able to maintain these low trends, when in actuality this slow growth may not be sustainable. this has deterred organizations, like sutter health, in low growth areas from participating in acos. in order to reward low spend and low growth organizations for the progress they have already made in reducing spending, cms should incentivize these organizations to\n page 2 of 4 | sutterhealth.org\n participate in acos by applying a more dramatic increase in their trend than what is currently proposed. we propose that organizations who are 1) in regions with growth trends below the national average, and 2) have historical spending at or below 85% of the national average receive a 3% increase to their trend factor. similarly, we think a scale should be used so that organizations in low growth areas with historical spending at or below 90% or 95% of the national average receive a 2% or 1% increase to their trend factor, respectively. this change to the benchmark would encourage organizations, like sutter health and those in northern california, to transition to a risk based apm instead of continued mips participation.\n\n benchmark should be normalized to reflect current year cost adjustments. as the rule is written now, the benchmark is not normalized based on various changing cost factors. due to rising wage indexes and changes in both physician and hospital reimbursement, sutter health recommends that the benchmark be normalized annually. specifically, the ipps hospital wage index and other wage index values, medicare physician fee schedule changes, market basket updates, mips adjustments, geographic practice cost indices (gpcls), and hospital reclassifications where significant increases in the wage index values occur, should be accounted for when normalizing previous years\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 data to create an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s annual benchmark.\n\n risk adjustment cap should be increased. as providers transition to accountable care organizations, providers will start to engage patients who previously had only episodic treatment and who have not enjoyed comprehensive care management. as these patients receive better, more coordinated care, their risk profile will also increase. the current proposed rule caps risk adjustment at 3%. sutter health recommends, in order to encourage providers to continue to care for complex patients, that the risk adjustment cap be increased to 6%.\n\n high revenue acos should not be penalized for their volume. in the proposed rule, high revenue acos are forced into risk faster than low revenue acos. high revenue acos should not be penalized for the size of their patient population and volume and scope of services. by not allowing high revenue acos to participate in the basic track for two contract periods, cms runs the risk of high revenue acos dropping out of the program early rather than transitioning to the enhanced track.\n sutter health, like many other integrated systems, partners closely with independent and community providers in our region, often including them in our networks for value based contracts. because of this partnership we are able to ensure coordinated patient care throughout all of our 22 counties. if high revenue acos are not allowed to participate in the basic track more than once this not only discourages large organizations like our own from participating, but also discourages independent physicians from participating in an aco with us. this negatively impacts our ability to provide coordinated patient care. in order to remedy this sutter health recommends that regardless of size, organizations have the option to apply for the basic track for two contract periods.\n\n glide path should be utilized for the enhanced track. the proposed rule transitions organizations from risk equal to 4% of their benchmark in the basic track to 15% in the enhanced track. organizations entering the enhanced track should be provided options much like their counterparts in the basic track where risk\n page 3 of 4 | sutterhealth.org\n increases to 4% over 3 years. sutter health recommends that rather than jumping from 4% to 15% between the two tracks, cms incrementally increase the risk 2% each year with the final year increasing to 15%.\n\n sutter health is committed to ensuring that our patients receive affordable, high quality, patient centered care. the changes that we have recommended ensure that providers and organizations will successfully transition to risk based alternative payment models and are not disadvantaged by their size or geographic location.\n\n we thank you in advance for your consideration of our

cms-approved and signed\r\n\r\nwe are a 2016 track 1 physician-led aco and are very concerned about having the timeline changed after all of our existing and new participants for 2019 have already signed new agreements approved by the cms.\r\n\r\ncurrent regulations state track 1 acos are limited to two agreement periods under a one-sided model before transitioning to a two-sided model beginning with their third agreement period. when we entered the final year of our initial agreement period, we created a new three-year agreement following these current regulations. we made significant changes for 2019, including higher expectations to achieve results, and completely changed our shared savings distribution model to meet current measure requirements.\r\n\r\nwe submitted our revised sample 2019 agreement to our cms coordinator and it was approved in may, 2018. we then spent the next two months meeting with every existing and new practice to explain the new agreement and expectations for our second agreement period. at this point, we have:\r\n-69 existing practices that have already signed the new cms-approved three-year track 1 agreement, representing some 20,000 beneficiaries.\r\n-another 16 new practices with 129 providers have also signed these new 2019 agreements, which would be effective january 1, 2019.\r\n-new agreements were submitted with change requests in aco ms based on the published timeline.\r\n\r\ntherefore, our entire group of participants is now ready to move forward under more stringent requirements for even better results in the next three-year agreement period as outlined in current regulations.\r\n\r\nif the rules change after all of these physicians have already signed the agreements that cms approved, the implications are serious.\r\n-under the proposed rule, it appears that our initial agreement would be extended through june, 2019. this means existing practices would be operating under a different agreement than the new practices, which means two different sets of expectations and two different distribution models. or we will have to go back to every practice to modify the agreement at a time when we need to be focused on getting results!\r\n-our 2019 mssp-approved participant agreement clearly outlines that we are a track 1 aco, and the distribution model is based on the shared savings program as outlined in the published cms regulations with a 50% shared savings. changing either of these key components as outlined in the proposed rule is significant enough to require revised participant agreements. the time and cost spent on revising agreements and revisiting 85 different practices will add significant burdens on the aco and its participants, and delay the execution of many initiatives underway to produce results this year.\r\n-our new participants expect to begin working with us in january, 2019, under a new three-year agreement. they did so with the understanding we can help them report a full year of data for mips. the implications in filing mips for these independent practices are complex based on these new bifurcated timelines.\r\n\r\nchanging the rules mid-stream when agreements have already been approved, signed and submitted is an unreasonable burden when we have so much to accomplish in the coming months. this will clearly impact our ability to meet goals.\r\n\r\nwe ask that cms keep the current program in place, finalize these rules and then roll them out in advance of the next program period. this would allow acos to transition their participants into revised

up the infrastructure, invested in software systems, and kicked off a population health program on a broad scale.\r\n-developed a network of nearly 400 engaged, independent providers including many in

been approved by cms?\r\n\r\nif the owners and participants do not have funding for an escrow account and we are forced to shut down the aco, all that we have invested to this point will be wiped out. the owners will not have a chance to recoup their investment, and future anticipated savings will be lost.\r\n\r\nseveral of our independent rural physicians have already said they are ready to retire, opt out of medicare or simply do the minimum required for mips if the aco were not there to guide them in this transition in the way care is provided.\r\n\r\nthe aco is playing a critical role in helping these poor, rural communities. we are careful stewards of the healthcare dollar and in only two years have improved quality and reduced healthcare expenditures for the patients we serve.\r\n\r\nwe have honored our commitment in making the program successful by reducing costs and improving quality. its vital that cms honor the commitments you have made to our physicians by

at their first visit of each calendar year is overly burdensome for a busy primary care practice. this means that in addition to providing each beneficiary with a document that the practice is part of an aco, a staff member must be available to explain it, answer questions and document the interaction.\r\n\r\nwe remember the problems that occurred when patients originally received the lengthy letter from cms notifying them of aco participation. it caused confusion and created unfounded concerns about patient privacy. the front desk staff members fielded calls every day from anxious patients.\r\n\r\nposting a notice and making copies available to those who ask has worked well this puts patients over paperwork. giving out notices and explaining them to every medicare beneficiary at a busy front desk or in an exam room is something else. many of our providers in rural areas see 40-60 patients a day. there are routinely 4-8 people waiting in line to check in or out. this rule would add a task that does not improve the quality of care provided, but increases valuable time and cost.\r\n\r\nand when those patients then ask the physician to explain this document also and they will it takes even more time away from acute and preventive care.\r\n\r\nthe proposed rule also states the aco would be required to establish a method for tracking beneficiary notification. that means ehr modifications, which adds cost to the practice and are yet another distraction from patient care.\r\n\r\nthe current regulations with signs posted and copies made available is sufficient. this proposed additional notification adds nothing to the quality of care being provided. nor does it add to transparency beneficiaries tell us they already assume health information is being shared among their care providers.\r\n\r\nalso, the notifications absolutely should not mention beneficiary incentives because not all acos will have the funding to provide these. for those acos able to provide

virginia that represents\r\na strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed\r\nproviders. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared\r\nsavings program (mssp).\r\n\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained\r\nquality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the\r\nlowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant\r\ninvestments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating\r\npositive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care\r\npartners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed\r\nrule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways\r\nto success.\r\n\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced\r\ntracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of\r\npreliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the\r\noption to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some\r\nmuch-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\n\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding\r\naccess to this important program feature.\r\n\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks\r\nwill create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk\r\nscores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between\r\nnewly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that\r\nlimiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect\r\nproviders who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can\r\nexperience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be\r\nadequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a\r\nbenchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to\r\nunderstand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the\r\nimportance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our\r\ndemonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our\r\naco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared\r\nsavings unattainable.\r\n\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged\r\nby the efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a\r\nstrong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of\r\nclaims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable\r\nreports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\n\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office\r\nworkflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of\r\nimportant documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also,\r\nwhile i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of\r\nimplementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense\r\nto my offices operations.\r\n\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look\r\nforward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow\r\nme and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care

\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 pathways to success (cms 1701-p)\n\n dear administrator verma:\n\n novartis appreciates the opportunity to submit this letter regarding the medicare shared savings program and accountable care organizations \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 pathways to success proposed rule.\n\n novartis provides healthcare solutions that address the evolving needs of patients and societies worldwide. our broad portfolio includes innovative pharmaceuticals and oncology medicines, generic and biosimilar medicines, and eye care devices. at novartis, we are united by a single mission:\n reimagining medicine to improve and extend people\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s lives. through science-based innovation we address some of society's most challenging healthcare issues. every day we work to discover and develop breakthrough treatments and find new ways to deliver them to as many people as possible.\n\n in the proposed rule, cms redesigns options for participating in the medicare shared savings program (mssp). two participation tracks, basic and enhanced, replace the current participation options. in creating these two tracks, participating acos would be required to take on more downside risk faster than is currently required. ultimately, cms wants participating acos to be in a two-sided risk arrangement because cms believes this type of arrangement will result in increased net savings for the program. however, if the emphasis in the program is hyperfocused on cost savings, there is a potential for under-treatment or decreased quality of care as a way to contain costs below the determined threshold. therefore, we encourage cms to apply a quality measure set that will evaluate the breadth of chronic conditions common in the mssp patient population and use appropriate outcome measures to ensure medicare beneficiaries are receiving all necessary care.\n\n in order for a healthcare organization to perform optimally within a shared savings arrangement, it is critical for care to be coordinated, data to be shared, and providers to communicate and rely on each other to achieve optimal clinical outcomes while managing cost of care. within this risk-sharing environment, there is potential to identify new ways to improve healthcare quality through application of measurement, improvement activities, and learning from the results. information gleaned from\n\n\n 1 83 cfr 41786 (august 17, 2018) [hereinafter \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3proposed rule\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5.\n\n quality and cost measurement can help to better identify areas of care in need of improvement and interventions that might yield those needed improvements.\n\n as cms continues to identify ways to better account for program spending, we encourage the agency to continue its commitment to better define high-quality outcomes for patients. the administration has already undertaken a number of initiatives to do so \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 including the meaningful measure initiative (mmi)\n included in this year\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed physician fee schedule rule.* the extent to which outcome measurement development can support a balanced approach to ensure patient quality is in fact improved, while still affecting total cost of care, is applicable under the goals of the mmi. inherent to the mssp is the goal of decreasing overall cost, which makes it even more important to safeguard quality of care.\n\n in the medicare physician fee schedule proposed rule, cms proposed changes to the mssp quality measure set, continuing in its efforts to advance quality of care, emphasize outcomes, and decrease reporting burden. to these ends, cms proposed changes that would result in removing 10 measures and adding one measure to the mssp quality measure set.\n\n we reiterate that we support streamlining the measure set. we support removing process measures that otherwise could be enveloped within outcome measures already included in the measure set.\n we also support the move toward use of outcome measures, as we believe that the emphasis on improved health outcomes is the appropriate focus and goal. however, in removing many measures from the set, we note that the resulting proposed set is relatively small \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 24 measures \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 which makes it challenging to evaluate all areas of care within the program. we note that nearly half of the proposed measure set \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 10 of 24 \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 would be cahps patient experience measures. while evaluation of patient experience is important and needed, patient experience survey answers may not provide a full, clear picture of healthcare quality. therefore, novartis supports inclusion of additional clinical quality measures that would evaluate a broader range of chronic conditions commonly found in the medicare population typically cared for within mssp. we note that the current proposed measure set does not include measures related to respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma or additional cardiovascular conditions like heart failure; we support including measures that evaluate care for these conditions. we recognize that these conditions would be included in the all-cause readmission measure, but we believe that revealing condition-specific results could allow for more quickly evaluating current practice and making changes that will improve patient care and outcomes. furthermore, we also support inclusion of measures that evaluate adherence to medication used to treat chronic conditions, because appropriate medication use is critical in managing these diseases. these measures would be complementary to the proposed admission and readmission measures and could serve to evaluate additional areas of care not already included in the set.\n\n we also recommend that cms continue to strive toward a core measure set that identifies and harmonizes measures across the mssp, hospital inpatient quality reporting program, hospital value-based purchasing program, hospital outpatient quality reporting program, and mips. we believe this is necessary so that incentives and goals are aligned across healthcare providers. in cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 medicare shared savings program fast facts from january 2018\u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u0096\u0091, 58% of participating

core set of quality measures across its programs.\n\n request for feedback on encouraging medicare acos to collaborate with the sponsors of stand-alone part d pdps (part d sponsors) to improve the coordination of pharmacy care for medicare ffs beneficiaries to reduce the risk of adverse events and improve medication adherence.\n\n cms requests comment on how mssp acos and part d prescription drug plan sponsors (pdps)\n could work together to improve coordination of pharmacy care. novartis supports cms in the effort of aiding medicare acos and pdps in better collaboration as it stands to enhance care coordination, improve medication use, and boost medication adherence. policymakers and government actuaries have long recognized the role that appropriate medication use can play in helping to improve patient outcomes and reduce spending under federal programs. policies that improve beneficiary access and adherence to prescribed medications have been found by the congressional budget office and other entities to improve care quality and reduce costs by preventing the use of medical services.4\n a recent analysis\u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ab found that while acos continue to build strategies to enhance medication use, challenges remain with both notification related to prescription use and measurement of the medication use on costs and quality outcomes. the research revealed several barriers to implementing more comprehensive medication strategies at acos, including:\n\n e lack of reimbursement for pharmacists\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 services,\n e poor technology interoperability, and\n e difficulty isolating and evaluating the cost savings associated with better medication use practices.\n\n for such a partnership to work well and to address these challenges, real-time data sharing is needed between cms, the aco, and the pdp so that relevant clinical information about patients can support clinical decision-making. currently, a pdp does not have the ability to reap any medical benefit savings as a result of optimized medication treatment, but a partnership between an aco and the pdp might create the right synergy to allow each entity to benefit from the other partner\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s work. a prime example of this is in the medication therapy management (mtm) program, where beneficiaries who have high medication costs, use multiple medications, and/ or have multiple chronic conditions are to have their medication regimens evaluated by a pharmacist or other provider to ensure that they are receiving the right treatments for their conditions. allowing acos and pdps to collaborate potentially provides the pdps all the necessary tools to perform a comprehensive medication review, counsel the patient on how to correctly take his medications, and monitor for any patient side effects or safety issues, while providing the potential for a financial arrangement between the two organizations to both benefit from this type of intensive review.\n\n such a partnership also could provide opportunity for medication synchronization refill programs, whereby the pharmacy simplifies the refill process for patients with multiple chronic medications by enabling the patient to pick up all their medications on a single date. at that time, the pharmacist can offer any needed medication information, evaluate the regimen for any safety issues, and assess if\n\n\n 4 cbo: offsetting drug use on medicare\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s spending for medical services, november 2012\n 5 chrisanne wilks, phd;

lincoln county hospital and its two rural health clinics operate in a federal hpsa for an under-served low income population. we are also a national health service corps site. we participate in the kansas clinical improvement collaborative (kcic).\r\n\r\ni am commenting in support of the kcic's proposal for a rural track accountable care organization.\r\n\r\nkcic delivers value to its participants by supporting local implementation of acute and\r\nambulatory evidence-based guidelines, providing chronic care management services,\r\ncoordinating the care continuum, leading smarter spending initiatives, performing data analytics,\r\nand producing performance dashboards. through its governing body and committees (which are\r\ncomprised of representatives from each participant), kcic provides a forum for rural providers\r\nto share experiences and overcome challenges in delivery system reform.\r\n\r\nwe are deeply concerned that the elimination of the shared savings-only model will force rural\r\nproviders to abandon the mssp just as we are embracing the model. initially, the mssp\r\nattracted few rural providers due to their small populations and lack of resources. with\r\nappropriate incentives and supports, however, many of us now are participating in\r\nmulti-community networks focused on quality and smarter spending. the mssp has provided a\r\nvehicle to accomplish what previously had seemed impossible: independent rural providers\r\ncollaborating to improve the health of their respective communities.\r\n\r\nas a practical matter, most rural acos will not be able to fund the required repayment\r\nmechanism that is proposed in the current rule under consideration. given its size and adjusted historical benchmark, kcic would have to secure a $2.3 million letter of credit or surety bond or place that amount in an escrow account. kcic itself does not have these resources and its participants small rural hospitals, rural health clinics, and\r\nfederally qualified health centers likely will not be able to bear this additional expense.\r\n\r\ndeveloping a rural track aco gives rural providers an opportunity to transition from volume based care to value based care that your new models would deny to us. i urge you to keep and/or develop an mssp for rural providers by adopting the rural track we are

verma,\r\n\r\nthe accountable care organizations that we have been associated with since 2012, atlantic accountable care organization and optimus healthcare partners, have been successful in reducing costs and improving quality during our tenure in the medicare shared savings program. optimus healthcare partners a 2012 starter and one that would be consider a high revenue aco in the new program, achieved shared savings in every one of the five years it has been in the program, totaling $59 million dollars since inception. our atlantic accountable care organization, a hospital owned aco was successful in achieving shared savings in 2015, and saving medicare in 2016, as well as improving quality.\r\none of our areas of concern in the proposed rule is the fact that cms is moving back to a beneficiary notification requirement that will place a tremendous administrative burden on our respective accountable care organizations from both a cost and human resources standpoint. we urge you to reconsider this and maintain the program in its current state of an opt out notification for data sharing and the posting of a aco participation notification in practice offices.\r\nwe write in opposition to other key aspects of the recent centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) proposed \"pathways to success\" rule on the medicare shared savings program, in particular the agency's proposal to cut accountable care organizations' (acos') shared savings rates below 50 percent, reduce the time in a shared savings-only model from six to two years, and introduce early termination policies based on spending that is slightly higher than benchmarks. we also urge cms to modify the proposed application of a +/- 3 percent risk adjustment cap across an extended agreement period by increasing that to +/- 5 percent.\r\nwe have extensive commercial aco relationships as well and we have always considered a payer provider partnership a 50:50 proposition. requiring non-risk bearing aco's to have only a 25% shared savings opportunity is not a partnership.\r\nacos have been in the forefront of transforming physician practice patterns with a reach far beyond the mssp program alone. it has fostered the patient centered medical home model of care, and allowed for greater coordination of care between providers. the proposal in the new rule particularly around, shortening the time to risk and offering the lowest savings opportunities will gut the program of new applicants, and cause a flight to other alternative models such as medicare advantage and commercial value-based contracts to the detriment of the traditional medicare beneficiary.\r\nanother area of concern is the mssp decision to define high revenue versus low revenue aco's, and force the former more rapidly into downside risk tracks. having managed both a physician led organization and a hospital led aco, we have from experience recognized that the high revenue aco's are actually more difficult to move forward down the risk glide path, because inherently they become a less cohesive group. high revenue acos as defined, have invested heavily on developing the infrastructure in both technology platforms and care management to help their acos eventually succeed. we urge cms to remove the distinction between high revenue and low revenue aco's.\r\n\r\n\r\non the other hand, we support a number of proposals in the rule and encourage cms to finalize its proposals to: 1) move to five-year agreement periods; 2) introduce a more gradual glide path to risk and make the track 1+ equivalent (basic level e) permanent; 3) reduce burdens related to quality reporting; 4) expand the use of waivers for telehealth and skilled nursing facility stays especially to all tracks and 5) provide flexibility with choosing assignment methodology regardless of risk model.\r\n\r\nthank you again for your work on behalf of patients and providers to advance value-based payment. we appreciate your interest in sustaining the success of medicare acos and creating an environment where providers are encouraged to enter into value-based payment arrangements and help patients receive high-quality, coordinate

the elimination of the current distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries; and policies on voluntary alignment. as a track 3 aco, the only aco in puerto rico (pr) and after

proposing the introduction of a monitoring approach and evaluation criterion, related to financial performance, we recommend for acos that have successfully demonstrated positive  results, in

financials (proposed participation-based for medicare ffs revenue and prior participation criteria), for the entire period during which the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policies are in place for a given event.  by not providing such an option, some acos may be unfairly and prematurely terminated. in addition, we believe that acos that have demonstrated significant quality metrics

98.05% and the share of year affected by disaster was set at 33.33% (or 4 months, sep- dec), which demonstrates the impact and longing effect this natural disasters had on the island. pr saw a historically high  number  of  its  residents  migrating  to  the  continental  us  during  the  months  following  the  hurricanes.  the  us bureau of transportation statistics (bts) reported in october 2017 alone 85,502 people left pr, after normalization of air transport between pr and the mainland.  a more complete picture was provided by the american community survey (acs) which concluded that 135,592 puerto ricans had actually relocated stateside after hurricane maria. in  our  opinion, acos are being  held  responsible  for  reductions  in  shared  savings  resulting  from  the  catastrophic events. in our case, the events that occurred in september 2017 were outside of our aco control but resulted in an increase in utilization and an increase in services rendered outside of puerto rico. in addition, in terms of the cms promoting interoperability proposal, we are in agreement with the elimination of aco-11 and moving towards the requirement that all acos demonstrate a specified level of certified electronic health record technology (cehrt).  we recommend that cms not make an unnecessary distinction in an area such as cehrt and are opposed to the different levels of percentages proposed; we instead propose that 50% should be the target that applies to all and then gradually increase over time. section proposed rule aco response comment /argument\n2.   revisions

experience of our aco in mssp that underscores the potential that enhanced physician and nurse practitioner engagernent and improved care coordination among an interdisciplinary team offers to significantly transforrn medical care delivery for the majority of medicare beneficiaries we serve, those who are long-term care residents living in our nursing facilities. the value of the model has been borne out over many years in the institutional special needs plan (i-snps) within medicare advantage, though operationalizing this model through mssp affords the potential of significantly greater scalability, as over one million traditional medicare beneficiaries currently reside in roughly 15,000 u.s. nursing homes. other programs that target the dual eligible population are primarily focused on expanding community-based supports to enable medicare beneficiaries to remain at home longer with greater potential at earlier stages of disease progression, while mssp can serve to address the complex needs of medicare beneficiaries already residing in long-term care settings many of whom are approaching the end of life. in fact, over 94 percent of genesis healthcare aco attributable beneficiaries live their remaining months and years within our centers without ever being discharged back to the community setting. in addition to improving care delivery for our residents, mssp has the potential to expand access to care by providing an attractive opportunity for providers practicing in nursing facilities, who have limited available pathways to advanced payment models, to participate directly in a value- based model. however, our ability to dernonstrate the significant potential that exists through this program hinges on the continued thoughtful consideration of the effect these and future rule changes may have on medicare's costliest population.\ni. accurate benchmark development \n page 5 \u0000 memorandum mailed the survey. this approach results in extremely low sample size of responses and statistical insignificance. in fact, cahps surveys completed for genesis healthcare aco in 2017 ranged from only 21 to 65 surveys, representing .2% to .7% of our attributed beneficiaries. furthermore, those sampled are entirely non-representative of our aco population that reside in the long-term care setting, and will not likely associate the care they received during their nursing facility stay with the primary care that is the subject of the survey. the implications of this inappropriate approach to garnering customer satisfaction with the delivery of primary care in our aco, especially the potential for extremely low results on the cahps survey, may in any performance year disqualify our aco frorn any shared savings altogether regardless of savings generated and achievement of quality perforrnance on other measures. as cms's use of cahps is not mandated by statute or regulation - law and regulations are general about what needs to be measured and do not dictate any specific survey tool - cms may implement a de rninimis cut- point so that cahps would only be required when a significant portion of the aco population is eligible to receive the survey, or excluded if only a nominal percentage are completed. in such situations, the associated points could be redistributed to the remaining quality measures and the patient experience domain requirement would automatically be satisfied. the agency also could consider a substitution of a validated survey of nursing home residents which assesses similar issues of provider access and experience intended by the current survey in lieu of the use of the cahps tool. de minimis standard for other quality measures similar to the concerns raised regarding cahps, other quality measures also systematically exclude institutionalized patients. depression remission at 12 months (aco-40) is one such measure. nursing home patients are excluded from the denominator. as a result, like cahps, this leads to miniscule sample sizes for acos like ours, resulting in a non-representative and statistically meaningless result. a de minimis standard should be applied here as well. institutional population adjustment to utilization metrics hospital utilization for our population is more than three times that of the average aco population. the higher average incidence of all-cause unplanned admissions for patients with multiple chronic conditions (aco-38) for institutional beneficiaries is not accounted for in the determination of scoring for quality metrics, realistically putting achievement for our population out of reach and precluding our ability to achieve 100%. we recommend that quality metric performance be measured against benchmarks adjusted to reflect the weighted average of institutionalized vs community-based beneficiaries, using the respective mean performance rate, 30% and 90% percentile benchmarks for each subset population.\n111. required risk-takhig \n page 6 \u0000 memorandum providers will be at-risk for the first time; this may enable the placernent of appropriate risk protection contracts. we support the treatment of level e as an advanced apm to acknowledge the assumption of risk and encourage greater participation at higher risk tracks. we recommend removal of restrictions preventing providers who begin at level e from moving up to the enhanced track without an interruption in their existing agreernent or the redetermination of benchmarks; rather, we would prefer that all levels of gainsharing and risk assumption be on a single platform to facilitate the continuous movement to higher thresholds. further, we would wish to see the highest level include the ability to earn 100% of savings, particularly as the next gen program sunsets. as a skilled nursing facility operator, we work closely with upstream hospital and physician providers in many markets across the country to improve outcomes for shared patient populations. we are concerned about the implications on patient health and appropriate care delivery that may result from mandatory risk assumption for existing acos. even in the current environment, some acos and at-risk hospitals exert pressure on skilled nursing providers to discharge patients sooner than may be appropriate, drawing influence from their ability to direct referral volume. while we agree that real change occurs more readily in a risk-based environment, we recommend that cms continue to move slowly, both by enabling providers to proceed into risk at their own pace and by ensuring that adequate safeguards and patient protections are in place to support patient safety above all else. given difficulties we have experienced across multiple performance years related to issues outside of our control that have impacted the deterrnination of our benchmarks, we are concerned about the imposition of early termination policies that penalize acos that do not generate savings. these proposed changes will harm patients and providers by limiting the improvements in savings and quality acos achieve, potentially slowing progress in transitioning to value-base payments.\niv. improvement in assignment methodology \n we support the added flexibility to enable acos to choose prospective or retrospective assignment methodology annually regardless of risk level. we also support a hybrid approach to enable beneficiaries to either voluntarily align with an aco-participating physician or nurse practitioner of their choice or to opt-in to the aco directly, though we recommend voluntary or opt-in alignment be renewed within the first year following determination of institutional status as the majority of community-based providers do not  follow patients into the long-term care setting. it was principally this lack in primary care coverage and timely and consistent access to medical providers that drove the creation of the genesis physician services organization and our\naco. the hybrid approach could be extended universally to all acos by default provided \n page 7 \u0000 memoranduni nurse practitioners (nps) and physician assistants (pas) for attribution consistent with cms regulations, nps and pas provide much of the care required by long-term care patients in many nursing homes. the role of the physician varies, with many physicians delegating their long-term care visits to thern. for this reason, we recommend cms reconsider the requirement of one physician visit by an aco participant, particularly in this care setting, where the plurality of primary care by an np or pa should suffice. for the same reason, we are supportive of voluntary alignment processes which permit attribution to an np or pa without requiring any additional aco physician visit. claims-based determination of place of service 31 and 32 we appreciate the proposed change in determination of place of service (pos) using medicare claims for skilled nursing facility stays, though caution cms to accommodate the longer claims runout period necessary as a result of post-acute billing practices before completing final aco beneficiary attribution, and would welcome transparency related to pos 31 and 32 clairns-based attribution on quarterly cclfs as this information becomes available.\nv. assumption of downside risk upon exit \n given that the mssp is still a developing program in which significant adjustments that are unknowable to acos are made to benchmarks at annual settlements that are completed far into the ensuing year providing limited time for planning and decision-making, we oppose the more stringent requirements to assume greater risk for losses during a year of voluntary termination. voluntary termination should be understood by cms as a hobson's choice, as most acos have invested significant resources to participate in mssp and likely exit only as a last resort.\nvi. expanded use of waivers for telehealth and skilled nursing facility use \n page 8 \u0000 memorandum\nvii. additional time for 2019 renewal \n\n", "0242": "as you know, under the current medicare shared savings program (mssp) beneficiary assignment regulations, an np is an authorized aco professional, but their patients cannot be assigned to the aco unless they receive one primary care service from a primary care physician participating with the aco each year. this has inhibited np practices from joining or establishing shared savings aco's and limited the scope of the shared savings program (mssp). if the mssp is to continue to develop and improve patient access, quality and cost effectiveness, it must be fully inclusive of nps and their patients.\r\n\r\ntherefore, i support cms' proposal to update the voluntary alignment option for beneficiary assignment in the shared savings program (mssp). this proposal would allow a patient to choose an np as their primary shared savings aco clinician and be assigned to an mssp aco without requiring a primary care service from a primary care physician. this proposal will increase the participation of nps and their patients in the mssp

accountability and an emphasis on care coordination. apma also appreciates that accountable care organizations (acos), like those under mssp, provide one of the main vehicles for health care professionals to achieve qualifying alternative payment model (apm)\n participant (qp) status under the medicare quality payment program (qpp). at the same time, we recognize that change is needed in the mssp to fully realize its potential in these areas. as cms contemplates changes for mssp, we urge cms to consider our comments and recommendations below.\n\n engagement of podiatrists in acos and other alternative payment models (apms)\n\n apma is concerned about the limited opportunities for meaningful engagement in acos for specialists, and in particular for podiatric physicians. podiatrists are classified as physicians under social security act section 1861(r)(3). podiatric physicians receive basic and clinical science education and training comparable to that of medical doctors, with four years of undergraduate education focusing on life sciences, four years of graduate study in one of the nine podiatric medical colleges, and at least three years of postgraduate, hospital-based residency training. this training, education, and experience enable podiatrists to serve an important role in managing care and improving outcomes for patients with significant health risks.\n\n while we do not have robust data on podiatrists\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 participation in apms, including acos, anecdotal information suggests fairly limited participation. at the same time, we believe that there are opportunities for podiatrists to contribute to acos, while also improving the care that patients receive.\n\n 1\n american podiatric medical association, inc.\n\n particularly for patients with diabetes, a comprehensive foot exam can help to prevent complications such as ulcerations, infection, cellulitis, and ultimately limb loss. indeed, the american diabetes association has endorsed care guidelines that include performance of annual comprehensive foot examinations for patients with diabetes. additionally, research has shown that podiatric intervention can reduce health care costs and prevent complications for patients with diabetes. \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5*\n acos offer a promising opportunity to partner with podiatrists to address diabetes care. however, there are many limitations that they currently face. annual preventive foot exams for patients with diabetes are not currently covered by the medicare program. and to the extent that at-risk foot care is covered for patients who meet specific diagnosis and class findings, the current limitations imposed by coverage policies and medicare administrative contractor (mac) determinations may mean that patients cannot and do not receive the care that is most appropriate for their condition.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096\n apma requests that cms encourage acos to work with podiatrists to deliver more appropriate care through specific policy changes that would encourage appropriate foot care for patients with diabetes.\n for example, cms could waive existing statutory, regulatory, and sub-regulatory restrictions on the delivery of annual comprehensive diabetic foot and lower extremity exams for patients with diabetes and related at-risk foot care, and allow such services to be provided without cost-sharing. cms could further define such services as primary care services that would allow patients to receive incentive payments under beneficiary incentive programs. cms could also build additional quality metrics into the mssp that focus on rates of diabetic foot exams, and/or related outcomes (for example related to foot and limb amputations) to assess acos on their provision of these services. these kinds of changes would encourage early assessment and identification of foot complications for patients with diabetes that would in turn improve health outcomes and patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 quality of life.\n\n more broadly, we believe cms could test a model, independently and in the context of the mssp and other existing models, that focuses on the universal delivery of annual comprehensive lower extremity exams to patients with diabetes. patients who receive a comprehensive diabetic lower extremity exam would then be stratified into high, medium, and low risk tiers, and podiatrists and other qualified practitioners could then manage patients, as needed, based on their risk. such a model would be necessary to establish access to such a preventive service, as well as conclusively demonstrate through a well-designed prospective study the quality and cost saving impacts of comprehensive diabetic lower extremity exams that currently available retrospective data support. we would be pleased to work with cms in the development of such a model.\n\n mssp quality measures\n cms solicits comments on possible changes to the mssp measure set to support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 meaningful measures initiatives. as described above, apma encourages cms to incorporate new quality measures into the mssp that would encourage acos to improve patient outcomes related to chronic disease, particularly related to diabetic foot care. these could include measures focused on the delivery of comprehensive diabetic

that data on specialty participation broadly is not readily available. we request that cvs make data publicly available on the extent of specialist participation (e.g. percent of physicians) by specialty across its apms, especially mssp and other acos. such data on mssp participation could be included in the regulatory impact analysis of the final rule. across apms, data should be made available in an easy-to- access and easy-to-understand manner. such data would help stakeholders like apma understand the extent of specialty participation in models, development engagement strategies, and identify gaps that would be used to support new model development, in order to promote equal opportunities for specialists to participate in models.\n\n if there are any questions

8013\n\n baltimore, md 21244-8013\n re: proposed rural track for the medicare shared savings program\n to the centers for medicare & medicaid services:\n\n the kansas clinical improvement collaborative (kcic) is a track 1 mssp aco whose participants include rural kansas hospitals and clinics. kcic is a subset of a larger rural clinically integrated network, the care collaborative, which presently includes providers from 55 kansas counties.\n\n kcic commenced participation in 2017 with providers from 16 communities. for 2018, that number nearly doubled, and kcic presently serves approximately 19,000 rural medicare beneficiaries. kcic anticipates significant growth in 2019, with the change in the attribution rules for rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers, as well as the addition of providers from two more communities. the other care collaborative providers remain interested in the mssp opportunity but have elected to focus on specific quality improvement initiatives in preparation for participation.\n\n kcic delivers value to its participants by supporting local implementation of acute and ambulatory evidence-based guidelines, providing chronic care management services, coordinating the care continuum, leading smarter spending initiatives, performing data analytics, and producing performance dashboards. through its governing body and committees (which are comprised of representatives from each participant), kcic provides a forum for rural providers to share experiences and overcome challenges in delivery system reform.\n\n kcic is deeply concerned that the elimination of the shared savings-only model will force rural providers to abandon the mssp just as they were embracing the model. initially, the mssp attracted few rural providers due to their small populations and lack of resources. with appropriate incentives and supports, however, many rural providers now are participating in multi-community networks focused on quality and smarter spending. the mssp has provided a vehicle to accomplish what previously had seemed impossible: independent rural providers collaborating to improve the health of their respective communities.\n\n kansas clinical improvement collaborative cms-1701-p page 2 of 5\n most rural providers, however, still are developing the competencies and capabilities necessary to assume risk for a population. for years, rural providers have been excluded from the pay-for- reporting and pay-for-performance programs that have prepared their urban counterparts to manage risk. while rural providers now are coming together to share infrastructure costs, requiring participation in a two-sided risk model will not accelerate this process. instead, it will likely reverse the trend; rural providers constrained by limited resources cannot afford to place those resources at risk.\n\n as a practical matter, most rural acos will not be able to fund the required repayment mechanism. given its size and adjusted historical benchmark, kcic would have to secure a $2.3 million letter of credit or surety bond or place that amount in an escrow account. kcic itself does not have these resources and its participants \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 small rural hospitals, rural health clinics, and federally qualified health centers \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 likely will not be able to bear this additional expense.\n\n as highlighted in the bipartisan policy center\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s january 2018 report reinventing rural healthcare, rural providers are eager to participate in value-based alternative-payment models, but policymakers must take into account their unique circumstances in developing alternative payment models. to that end, kcic proposes cms include a one-sided \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3rural track\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 (in addition to the basic and enhanced tracks) to encourage and enable rural providers to pursue

rural track.\n\n kansas clinical improvement collaborative\n cms-1701-p page 3 of 5\n\n4. an aco meeting the definition of a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3rural aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 would have the option to enter into a\n non-renewable five-year rural track agreement, with the following terms:\n\n a.\n\n the rural aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s historical benchmark would be calculated in the manner defined in proposed 42 cfr 425.601(a) to (d), with one exception explained below. on an annual basis, that benchmark would be adjusted and the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s expenditures would be calculated as specified in proposed 42 cfr 425.605(a). calculation of shared savings under the rural track would be based on current 42 cfr 425.604(b) to (f).\n\n due to rural acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 high market share in the counties in which aco participants are located, the reference population used to calculate a rural aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s regional expenditure would exclude the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s assigned beneficiaries. if, as a result of such exclusion, a rural aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s reference population would be less than 5,000, the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s regional service area would be expanded to include assignable beneficiaries in adjoining counties until a sufficient reference population is reached.\n\n by no later than september 1 of performance years 1 and 2, a rural aco must notify cms whether it intends to remain in the rural track or elect to move into the basic track at level c or higher or the enhanced track for the following performance year. by september 1 of performance years 3 and 4, the aco must notify cms whether it intends to remain in the rural track or elect to move to the enhanced track.\n\n at the end of the five-year agreement period, a rural aco would be required to move into the enhanced track if it elected to remain in the mssp. the benchmark would be reset in the manner specified in proposed 42 cfr 425.601(e)\n (with the modified reference population discussed above).\n\n balanced against the advantages of a rural track are the three justifications cms has offered for abandoning one-sided shared savings-only models: (1) downside risk incents more change and thus generates more savings, as demonstrated by acos in two-sided models performing better over time than one-sided model acos; (2) track 1 acos that are generating financial losses still have access to the mssp fraud and abuse waivers to shield participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 otherwise impermissible financial arrangements; and (3) the one-sided shared savings-only model \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3may be encouraging consolidation in the market place, reducing competition and choice for medicare ffs beneficiaries.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5+\n\n\n 1 cms fact sheet, proposed pathways to success for the medicare shared savings program (aug. 9, 2018).\n\n kansas clinical improvement collaborative cms-1701-p page 4 of 5\n cms relies solely on performance year 2016 results to support its claim of underperformance by track 1 acos. however, the regulatory impact analysis (ria) accompanying the proposed rule explains that cms underestimated 2016 program savings attributable to the mssp because it did not account for the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3spillover effect\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 to non-assigned beneficiaries:\n\n total implied savings, including the assumed spillover savings, would imply medicare acos were responsible for about 50 percent of the lower spending growth in aco markets (after becoming aco active), or roughly 0.5 percent lower total ffs parts a and b spending in 2016 after accounting for shared savings payments.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5\n less than a week following publication of the proposed rule, cms released the performance year 2017 results, showing that track 1 acos generated nearly $300 million in net program savings.\n the thirty-nine track 2 and 3 acos saved $27 per beneficiary while the 433 track 1 acos saved $37 per beneficiary.\n\n similarly, a pair of program evaluation reports released by the center for medicare & medicaid innovation shortly following the proposed rule\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s publication undermine cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 criticism of one- sided shared savings-only model. on august 27, cmmi posted the first annual report for the next generation aco model. in 2016, the 18 experienced acos participating in this two-sided risk model generated a 1.1% reduction in medicare expenditures.\n\n four days later, cmmi posted the first annual report for the aco investment model. in 2016, the 41 new acos serving rural and underserved areas \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 all track 1 acos - generated a 1.7% reduction in medicare expenditures.\n\n in short, experience demonstrates that one-sided versus two-sided is not determinative of aco performance, and it is unlikely cms will realize greater savings by requiring all acos to take risk.\n instead, as noted in the ria, the data shows \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3that acos produce a higher level of net savings and more optimal financial performance results the longer they have been in the shared savings program....\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5? cms, therefore, should pursue policies to encourage broader participation, rather than accepting the anticipated downturn in participation from acos unwilling to accept risk.\n\n with regard to cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 second justification \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 concern regarding the improper use of the fraud and abuse waivers by under-performing acos \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 there is no reported incident of an aco engaging in such misconduct. and, in fact, cms has adequately addressed this concern in its proposed revisions to 42 cfr 425.224 regarding application procedures for renewing acos.\n\n\n\n 2 83 fed. reg. 41,919 (aug. 17, 2018) (emphasis added).\n 3 |d at 41,917.\n\n kansas clinical improvement collaborative cms-1701-p page 5 of 5\n finally, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 stated concern regarding consolidation is directly contradicted in the ria:\n\n further, evidence suggests that overall payment reform has been associated with little acceleration in consolidation of health care providers that surpasses trends already underway...., although there is some evidence of potential defensive consolidation in response to new payment models.... anecdotally, acos provide physician practices with a way to stay independent and offer a viable alternative to merging with a hospital.\n\n like physician practices, acos offer rural providers a means to navigate the transition from volume- to value-based care. we urge cms to keep the mssp a viable option for rural providers by incorporating the rural track.\n\n sincerely,\n /s/\n robert moser, m.d.\n executive director and chief medical officer kansas clinical improvement collaborative\n\n", "0245": "see attached file(s)

dear administrator verma:\n\n the blue cross blue shield association (bcbsa) \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 a national federation of 36 independent, community- based, and locally operated blue cross and blue shield (bcbs) companies (plans) that collectively provide healthcare coverage for one in three americans \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed rule for the medicare shared savings program (mssp) as issued in the federal register on aug. 17, 2018 (83 fr 41786).\n\n we believe that the overarching goal of delivery system and payment reform should be to transition from a system based on fee-for-service (ffs) design to one that pays based on quality, safety, and effectiveness of care. we welcome the contributions that accountable care organizations (acos) have made to date in the medicare marketplace and believe that more savings and higher quality can be gained with two-sided risk arrangements.\n\n bcbs companies have been actively engaged in transforming our healthcare system from one based on ffs to a system based on quality and performance. in fact, today, bcbs plans across the nation are spending 31 percent of medical claims dollars in programs that provide incentives for better health outcomes while reducing costly duplication and waste in care delivery.\n\n our comments are informed by bcbs plans and bcbsa\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s extensive experience pioneering innovative payment approaches that move away from ffs and toward quality and outcomes-based payment. bcbs plans partner with more than 342,000 providers who are providing value-based care and collectively cover more than 61 million members through acos and patient-centered medical homes (pcmhs)\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 2 of 13\n\n\n across all 50 states and the district of columbia. through these collaborations, bcbs plans are seeing positive results through partnerships that incentivize more accountable care. for example:\n\n independence blue cross\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 (ibc) primary care incentive program is designed to promote high- quality, accessible and cost-effective care and works in tandem with ibc's aco payment model to incent and energize primary care physicians into re-emerging as leaders in accountable care.\n the program has demonstrated a 24 percent decrease in avoidable emergency room visits, a 20 percent decrease in medical admissions, well-child visit rates that were 35 percent better than the national average, breast cancer screening rates that were 17 percent better than the national average, and other meaningful improvements.\n\n blue cross and blue shield of south carolina deploys dedicated innovation specialists to its pcmhs to help physicians transform their practices across leadership, clinical and administrative levels to improve patient health and address costs. in 2017, the program resulted in a 9 percent decrease in emergency room visits for medical home patients. per member per month claims for members in these practices were 6 percent lower. and hospital admission rates were 10 percent lower per 1,000 patients. the program has also shown an overall 2 percent cost savings for members with the target conditions.\n\n carefirst bluecross blueshield\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s pcmh and complementary total care & cost improvement (tcci) program, launched in 2011, gives providers the resources they need to deliver higher- quality, more coordinated care. pcmh physicians are grouped into panels of 10 to 15 to coordinate the care of members with the most pressing healthcare needs. panels earn additional payments based on the quality of care provided and savings achieved. the tcci program provides additional supports to address the complex needs of patients with behavioral health, chronic condition and home care needs. the program has helped to slow the annual growth in healthcare costs to just 3.4 percent, compared to 7.5 percent prior to the program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s inception.\n a savings of nearly $1 billion since 2011, including 10.5 percent fewer hospital admissions, 17.1 percent fewer days in the hospital, and 34.7 percent fewer hospital readmissions for all causes per 1,000 carefirst bluecross blueshield members attributed to the program.\n\n we commend cms for making vigorous efforts to encourage the transition to two-sided risk models \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 a prominent focus of the updated mssp. bcbs plans\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 experience shows that, by itself, a payment system incorporating only shared savings may indeed yield some improvements in cost and quality, but it cannot begin to have the power to reshape practice patterns as effectively as a system that also puts providers at risk for losses.\n\n we urge cms to consider the following priority issues as it finalizes the rule:\n\n first, we commend cms for making vigorous efforts to encourage the transition to two-sided risk models by streamlining the participation tracks. the move to value is inescapable and cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 efforts to innovate and encourage providers will help drive needed change to get there. we encourage cms to carefully monitor these efforts to support their continued growth and improvement.\n\n second, we agree with cms that an opt-in assignment option for beneficiaries is redundant with the voluntary provider alignment option beneficiaries have already and would likely lead to beneficiary confusion on the differences between acos under mssp and medicare advantage\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 3 of 13\n\n\n (ma) plans. we encourage cms to continue to enhance the voluntary provider alignment option as proposed under this rule rather than implementing an opt-in methodology.\n\n e third, aco waivers and inducements should not involve \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3steerage\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 or payment for items like part b premiums, medigap or other such significant \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3inducements.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 while we applaud the agency for moving in the right direction, we are concerned that such waivers or inducement could undermine the medicare advantage program, which is a stable and attractive program that 19 million beneficiaries rely on today.\n\n e fourth, we encourage cms to make certain that acos are not viewed by beneficiaries as an equivalent alternative to fully risk-based ma plans. ma plans use risk-based provider arrangements and the flexibility ma provides to improve outcomes for patients, delivering demonstrable meaningful outcomes (e.g., high star ratings). as you know, the sponsoring organizations of ma plans must be state-licensed and meet state solvency standards \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 these are steps that cms has required since implementing these risk-based, capitated programs. we believe these safeguards, including mandating an organization has a governing board, requiring a financial status that includes reserves, and ensuring consumer protections are in place, are integral to the accountability and success of the program as a whole. bcbsa understands the need for more two-sided, risk-based acos to serve traditional ffs medicare beneficiaries and drive towards improved outcomes and efficiency, but should meet all of the standards and protections required of other risk-bearing organization.\n\n we offer detailed comments and recommendations in the subsequent sections, following the structure of the notice: (a) redesigning participation options, (b) ffs benefit enhancements, (c) beneficiary engagement tools, and (d) updating program policies.\n\n comments on the proposed rule for the medicare program; medicare shared savings program (mssp): accountable care organizations (aco)-pathways to success\n\na. redesigning participation options\n\n issue: redesigning participation options to facilitate performance-based risk\n cms proposes to replace the existing three-track participation model with a two-track (basic and enhanced) model. the new basic track would replace the existing tracks 1, 1+ and 2, offering a path from a one-sided model to progressively higher increments of risk and reward. the new enhanced track would replace the existing track 3 for acos that take on the highest level of risk and potential reward. furthermore, agreements would last for a period of five years.\n\n recommendation #1:\n\n we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed streamlining of the aco participation tracks and specifically agree with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to extend the length of agreement periods from three to five years.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 4 of 13\n\n\n rationale #1:\n\n we strongly support and commend cms for making vigorous efforts to encourage the transition to two- sided risk models by streamlining the participation tracks. bcbs plans\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 experience shows that, by itself, a payment system incorporating only shared savings may indeed yield some improvements in cost and quality, but it cannot begin to have the power to reshape practice patterns as effectively as a system that also puts providers at risk for losses.\n\n since the mssp overlays a ffs framework, it is essential that incentives are powerful enough to overcome the inherent limitations of ffs medicine. therefore, we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 continued push to hold acos accountable for losses. in addition, a longer agreement period provides aco participants, cms and beneficiaries with a greater level of consistency and predictability. this should help participants better plan and prepare for their increased responsibilities.\n\n recommendation #2:\n\n bcbsa recommends that cms consider a smaller change in the shared savings rate from track 1 (50 percent share savings rate) to the basic track (25 percent - 50 percent).\n\n rationale #2:\n\n we believe that reducing the shared saving rate under the basic track would limit the risk for newly created acos, and therefore, enable greater participation. while we support the move to encourage acos to take on more risk, we understand that a higher rate initially may serve as a barrier to entry and could, therefore, limit the success of the mssp in the long run.\n\n recommendation #3:\n\n we commend cms for working to address issues of a limited subset of acos potentially gaming the program and avoiding taking of down-side risk. we recommend that cms carefully monitor participation moving forward to support these changes and future refinements of the approach.\n\n rationale #3:\n\n we agree that instituting more rigorous screening of acos and providers for good standing and previous mssp participation, as well as instituting accountability for partial-year losses along with the updated glide path, will help address concerns with acos not acting in good faith.\n\n however, it is likely some acos will drop out of the program, and fewer new organizations will choose to start under the more accelerated glide path. while this will also likely mean that the remaining acos participating will be more dedicated and driven to meet the goals of the program, careful monitoring of participation trends (e.g., what acos are dropping out, when are acos dropping out, what type of acos are forming) may help inform modifications needed to the program as we move forward.\n\n issue: basic track with glide path to performance-based risk\n under the proposed basic track, cms plans to implement a five-level glide path that includes a one- sided risk model for no more than the first two consecutive performance years and three levels of progressively higher risk and potential reward for at least the last three performance years of the five year agreement. acos would be required to move to the enhanced track after one agreement period in the basic track.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 5 of 13\n\n\n recommendation:\n\n we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 goal of facilitating acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 transition to performance-based risk more quickly through the updated basic track glide path to performance-based risk.\n\n rationale:\n\n a shared savings-only model for acos meeting quality and cost growth targets does not fully incentivize acos to become more effective and efficient. while we recognize the need to not accelerate movement into risk-bearing arrangements for those providers that are not ready, we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 implementation of a faster glide path to assume greater risk.\n\n our plans\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 experience demonstrates that, with adequate support, many providers can be ready for two- sided risk within a few years. given the unique size and scope of the medicare program, the mssp represents an important opportunity for cms to drive meaningful change in the system.\n\n issue: proposals for assignment of beneficiaries\n the bipartisan budget act of 2018 required cms to provide greater flexibility in the assignment of medicare ffs beneficiaries to acos by allowing acos in tracks under retrospective beneficiary assignment a choice of prospective assignment for the agreement period. as such, cms is proposing to provide all acos with a choice of prospective assignment or preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation and to allow for acos to select their assignment methodology on an annual basis.\n\n recommendation:\n\n we support cm9q\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to make prospective assignment available to all tracks, regardless of one- sided or two-sided risk. in addition, we recommend that cms clarify the following:\n e what the process will be for assignment and what communications would be involved.\n e how the retrospective versus prospective methodology would impact shared savings/losses calculations.\n e whether there be full disclosure to beneficiaries upon assignment to an aco and expectations as to the network of providers.\n e whether beneficiaries assigned can receive care outside of an aco at any given time.\n e what the process will be if a beneficiary wants to opt-out of the program.\n\n rationale:\n\n as there is no clear industry consensus as to which method of assignment is preferable, we commend cms for proposing to make prospective assignment available to all acos. as this moves forward, it would be helpful to understand the nuances of how this will work in the new two-track model. additional details will help stakeholders identify and, to the extent possible, address any unintended negative impacts to beneficiaries.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 6 of 13\n\n\n issue: monitoring for financial performance\n cms proposes to monitor whether the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s expenditures for its assigned beneficiary population are \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3negative outside corridor,\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 meaning that the expenditures exceed the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark by an amount equal to or exceeding either 1) the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s negative minimum savings rate (msr) under a one-sided model or 2) the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s medical loss ratio (mlr) under a two-sided model.\n\n recommendation #1:\n\n bcbsa supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 efforts to hold acos accountable, but recommends a remediation path for acos so as not to deter participation. one approach could be to provide a probationary period where acos have a year to improve their expenditures before termination from the program.\n\n rationale #1:\n\n as mentioned earlier, we commend cms for working to address issues of acos not acting in good faith and/or not meeting the goals of the mssp program. however, with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 more ambitious push for acos to take on risk under the streamlined basic and enhanced tracks, it is likely some acos will drop out of the program, and fewer new organizations will choose to start. while this will also likely mean that the remaining acos participating will be more dedicated and driven to meet the goals of the program, it does not necessarily mean that they will immediately be more successful. by providing acos opportunities to improve their expenditures whenever possible prior to termination \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 through use of probationary periods or corrective action plans \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 cms can help ensure the continued viability and growth of the mssp.\n\n recommendation #2:\n\n bcbsa recommends that cms provide more guidance and clarification in this area on its planned timing for determining actions (e.g., when cms and the aco know it is underperforming versus when participation decisions need to be made).\n\n rationale #2:\n\n timing for making these determinations is complicated. specifically, it can be challenging to assess how an aco has performed until well into its second year, making it difficult to determine or take an appropriate action until the third year. if an aco performs poorly in year one, but performs well in year two, then it seems reasonable that the aco should be allowed to participate in year four. if termination action is taken based on year-one results, this may not happen.\n\n\nb. ffs benefit enhancements\n\n issue: aco definitions (high-revenue/low-revenue and experienced/inexperienced\n\n\n cms discussed distinguishing acos based on their degree of control over total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for their assigned beneficiaries by identifying low-revenue versus high-revenue acos.\n specifically, cms proposes to define acos by the proportion of revenue through an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s beneficiaries versus an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s total expenditures. in addition, cms proposes to identify the available participation options for an aco (regardless of whether it is applying to enter, re-enter or renew its participation in the program) by considering the level of risk with which the aco or its participants have experience based on participation in medicare aco initiatives in recent years.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 7 of 13\n\n\n recommendation:\n\n bcbsa supports the proposed definitions, but recommends cms clarify the timelines and detailed processes for how it will monitor, review and communicate changes on the different categories.\n\n rationale:\n\n bcbsa believes that it is important that cms provide ample time to allow acos to consider their current track, make any changes and execute a coordinated transition into any new track. as such, guidance on when cms will complete its assessment of all acos regarding their categorization as low-revenue or high-revenue and disseminate its assessments will be important so providers have enough time to determine which track they may be required to join for the upcoming performance year.\n\n in addition, providing more detailed processes governing the designation of aco categories will help to protect against the potential for aco gaming whereby acos use creative business organization strategies to ensure that they are able to remain in the low-revenue designation.\n\n issue: additional flexibility provided through waivers for enhanced track participants\n cms proposed to extend the use of existing aco waivers to further promote participation in the two- sided, performance-based risk models. the proposed waiver extensions are aimed at giving risk-bearing enhanced track acos, which already have an incentive to reduce wasteful spending and over- utilization, additional flexibility with respect to certain medicare payment and program requirements associated with inpatient skilled nursing facility (\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3snf\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5) care and telehealth services. specifically, cms proposes to expand use of the snf three-day rule waiver to all eligible acos regardless of beneficiary assignment approach and to allow for payment for telehealth services in non-rural areas and, in some cases, at home.\n\n recommendation:\n\n bcbsa supports this approach and we recommend that cms extend the waivers discussed in the proposed rule equally to all aco participants that accept double-sided risk and make all waivers publicly available.\n\n rationale:\n\n cmsq\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal is a definite step in the right direction that would grant acos additional flexibility (waivers)\n to provide benefits and services beyond medicare\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s current rules. however, these standards should be applied consistently across all acos that assume double-sided risk to avoid risk selection and steerage issues. transparency through public reporting and oversight can be another check to prevent aco participants from misusing any waivers approved by cms.\n\n\nc. beneficiary engagement tools\n\n issue: beneficiary incentives\n cms proposes to allow acos under a subset of two-sided risk models to provide incentive payments to patients to encourage them to obtain medically necessary primary care services.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 8 of 13\n\n\n recommendation:\n\n bcbsa supports the guardrails cms has previously established for aco beneficiary incentives as well as applying them to the new incentives allowable per the balanced budget act of 2018. in addition, bcbsa recommends that cms establish requirements that acos release public notifications of their beneficiary incentive programs.\n\n rationale:\n\n incentive payments can work to affect appropriate use of items like preventive services, completion of medication management reviews and health risk assessments, but they should not be allowed to steer enrollment. this could lead to adverse incentives in the market, creating risk pool imbalances and impairing the stability of the program if some acos are acting in bad faith and inappropriately steering healthy beneficiaries to their organizations or sicker beneficiaries away. instituting transparency requirements would provide an additional check on acos to encourage appropriate use of incentive programs.\n\n issue: benchmark methodology\n cms proposes to update the regional factor adjustment, which is currently applied to an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s historical benchmark after its first agreement period. the current adjustment is a percentage of the difference between an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s regional ffs expenditures and its own historical expenditures, with a gradual phase- in to 70 percent of regional expenditures. however, to improve program sustainability and the accuracy of benchmark calculations, cms proposes to incorporate regional expenditures into aco benchmarking methodology for all acos in their first agreement period starting july 1, 2019, and in future years.\n\n recommendation:\n\n bcbsa supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to incorporate regional expenditures into aco benchmarking methodology for all acos in their first agreement period.\n\n rationale:\n\n incorporating regional expenditures into aco benchmarking methodology for all acos in their first agreement would create a more accurate and fairer benchmark for acos. given geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic variations across the country, a national benchmark can have the unintended consequences of both holding some acos to overly high standard and other acos to a lower level of achievement given the populations they serve.\n\n issue: beneficiary opt-in based assignment methodology\n cms is soliciting comments on a beneficiary opt-in assignment option, specifically the process issues underlying a potential methodology. cms indicates acos would be responsible for beneficiary notification, collecting opt-in data, and reporting to cms. cms notes that the mssp opt-in process could borrow elements from ma, but that the timelines and processes would need to be distinct to prevent beneficiary confusion.\n\n recommendation:\n\n we agree with cms that an opt-in option for beneficiaries is redundant with the voluntary provider alignment option beneficiaries have already and which is proposed to expand under this rule. we\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 9 of 13\n\n\n recommend cms continue to enhance the voluntary provider alignment option as proposed under this rule rather than implementing an opt-in methodology at this time.\n\n rationale:\n\n the concept of beneficiary opt-in is appealing and, ultimately, the long-term success of any value-based care model will depend on the willingness of the beneficiaries to choose their providers and be equal partners in their care. however, as cms articulates in the proposed rule, beneficiaries already have the option to choose a primary clinician and subsequently \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3opt-in\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 to the aco in which the clinician participates. this approach maintains the connection between assignment and utilization of primary care services as reinforced by comparing beneficiaries\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 voluntary alignment choices with what their alignment would have been under the claims-based methodology. per cms analysis, use of this approach to date has resulted in 92 percent of the beneficiaries who voluntarily aligned already being assigned to the same aco under the claims-based assignment algorithm. under the expanded definition of \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3primary clinician\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 proposed in this rule, it is reasonable to assume this percentage will move closer to 100 percent.\n\n furthermore, creation of a new process for beneficiary enrollment could, as cms notes, lead to beneficiary confusion between the differences of acos under mssp and ma plans. while we commend cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 thoughtfulness in how to leverage ma best practices to protect beneficiaries and help ensure acos act thoughtfully and appropriately under an opt-in methodology, the close alignment to ma plan practices emphasizes the risks of creating a potentially duplicative system of enrollment and adding unnecessary complexity to the medicare program, both administratively for cms and for beneficiaries.\n\n finally, such a methodology raises important additional questions not yet addressed by cms on how such an approach would work, including:\n\n e what type of education and outreach would be necessary to ensure that beneficiaries understand what they are selecting?\n\n e what are the implications for acos and beneficiaries should they choose to opt-out of an aco?\n\n e would the possibility of opt-in allow for acos to create innovative benefit designs to encourage participation in value-based care models?\n\n issue: broader beneficiary choice of their \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3primary clinician\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5\n cms proposes to allow beneficiaries to designate any aco professional regardless of specialty as their primary clinician responsible for managing overall care.\n\n recommendation:\n\n we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 expansion of aco professionals that beneficiaries can designate as their primary clinician to all specialties, but would encourage the selection of a primary care provider overall, such as an internist or family practitioner.\n\n rationale:\n\n as articulated above, in regards to a beneficiary opt-in methodology, expanding \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3primary clinicians\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 to include all specialties is a meaningful and reasonable approach to increasing beneficiary enrollment choice. this approach maintains the connection between assignment and utilization of services, will likely result in more ffs beneficiaries enrolling into acos, and will prevent confusion between acos and ma plans.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 10 of 13\n\n\n however, this change has the potential to dilute the importance of preventive services, care coordination and case management as specialists may be more focused on care specific to their specialty areas. for\n example, an oncologist as a primary care provider for an aco member would not necessarily be focused on performance measures that relate to preventive services. it will be important for cms and acos to be mindful of that potential, so they can mitigate against any adverse outcomes that arise.\n\n\nd. updating program policies\n\n issue: aco quality measures targeting appropriate opioid use\n cms is seeking comments on approaches to developing the program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s quality measures set in response to the meaningful measures initiative and to support addressing opioid utilization within the ffs population, including additional aggregate data that could be useful or quality measures that could be used to assess factors related to opioid utilization.\n\n recommendation:\n\n bcbsa supports adding opioids-related measures targeted to factors related to opioid utilization. to align with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposals for measurement under the merit-based incentive payment system (mips), we propose that cms implement the prescription drug monitoring program (pdmp) query measure proposed for mips if implemented.\n\n rationale:\n\n the opioid crisis continues to grow, with the centers for disease control and prevention estimating 115 americans die each day from opioid-related overdose. it is a complicated problem where more and better data are needed and where all parties need to be encouraged to improve. bcbsa agrees that promoting the measurement of opioid use and overuse, risks, monitoring and education through quality reporting is an important step to understanding and addressing the opioid crisis. all parties can benefit from more insight into the quality of services being provided.\n\n specific to the pdmp query measure, the centers for disease control and prevention recommends the checking of pdmps as an important step to improve opioid prescribing practices by allowing clinicians to:\n\n e identify patients who may be overusing or misusing opioids by obtaining prescriptions from multiple clinicians\n e better understand a patient\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s daily morphine equivalent dose\n e identify patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 other prescriptions and screen for other substances that may increase a patient\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s risk\n since most states have implemented pdmps at this time, and we encourage the use of these tools, the pdmp query measure is a reasonable step to improve and measure quality in opioid prescribing.\n\n issue: aco certified electronic health record technolo cehrt) usage requirements\n cms is seeking comments on the proposed cehrt usage changes and their start date, as well as whether all acos (not just those in advanced apm tracks) should be required to meet a cehrt standard greater than 50 percent. cms also solicits comments about removing measure aco-11 from the shared savings program and removing the separate aco penalty/reward criterion regarding cehrt use.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 11 of 13\n\n\n recommendation #1:\n\n bcbsa supports the changes proposed by cms to require acos to certify that at least 50 percent of the eligible clinicians participating in the aco use cehrt to document and communicate clinical care to their patients and other healthcare providers.\n\n rationale #1:\n\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 decision to standardize the reporting requirements for promoting interoperability helps achieve the goal of reducing the regulatory reporting burden across the federal payment programs. promoting interoperability is a systemwide goal, and while the specific quality measures themselves may change across clinical specialties and within payment models, the overall goal of achieving a top-line percentage of cehrt usage within the reporting entity should, and can, be a common goal.\n\n recommendation #2:\n we support the decision to remove aco-11 as a duplicative reporting requirement.\n rationale #2:\n\n we support the reduction in duplicative reporting burdens and agree that discontinuing the use of the aco-11 will improve alignment with the requirements of the quality payment program.\n\n recommendation #3:\n\n bcbsa recommends that the communication definition be expanded to include the communication of clinical information with payers as necessary to address payment and care coordination issues.\n\n rationale #3:\n\n bcbsa agrees that interoperability must be promoted by the expansion of the use of cehrt by physicians in acos, apms and other value-based payment models both in government programs and commercial markets. however, interoperability does not stop with the exchange of clinical data among providers, but must also extend to making the clinical information accessible and meaningful to the patients and accessible and supportive in pursuit of the efficiency and quality care goals in those value- based payment models. therefore, we support the availability and integration of clinical and administrative data as a goal for cehrt.\n\n issue: coordination of pharmacy care for ffs beneficiaries\n cms seeks comment on how medicare acos and part d sponsors could work together and be encouraged to improve the coordination of pharmacy care for ffs beneficiaries.\n\n recommendation:\n\n we recommend that cms promote ways to leverage acos in ma, such as greater flexibility in network design, to encourage more value-based contracting between these high-performing networks and ma plans.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 12 of 13\n\n\n rationale:\n\n this would increase opportunities for acos and ma plans to work together and drive improvements in quality. the more cms can allow for opportunities for acos and ma plans to work together, the more we move the needle to improve medicare overall.\n\n issue: innovative business arrangements to reward plan sponsors for beneficiary outcomes within pharmacy care coordination\n cms seeks comments on ways to support innovative business arrangements to financially reward plan sponsors for related better beneficiary outcomes.\n\n recommendation #1:\n\n currently, there is sharing of part d data with acos, however, these data flows could be improved by putting in standards for acos that are more aligned with ma prescription drug plans (ma-pds) that would encourage better outcomes, such as medication management reviews on their assigned beneficiaries, particularly for opioids and other substances prone to abuse.\n\n rationale #1:\n\n receiving more actionable part d data would complement aco medical data, helping acos to have the complete picture of, and better coordinate, a beneficiary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s care. to help ensure this data is used to lead to better outcomes, acos should be expected to use medical management techniques similar to the standards practiced in ma-pd. medical management is an important tool to promote safe, effective and low-cost treatment.\n\n recommendation #2:\n\n we recommend cms continue to pursue avenues to modernize patient privacy protections by aligning 42 cfr part 2 with hipaa standards.\n\n rationale #2:\n\n the federal regulations that govern confidentiality of drug and alcohol treatment and prevention records (42 cfr part 2) set requirements limiting the use and disclosure of patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 substance use records from certain substance use programs. patients are required to give multiple consents, creating a barrier for integration and coordination of healthcare. a lack of access to the full scope of medical information for each patient can result in the inability of providers and organizations, including acos and plan sponsors, to deliver safe, high-quality treatment and care coordination. the barriers presented by part 2 can result in the failure to integrate services and can lead to potentially dangerous medical situations for patients.\n modernizing the statutory language would help ensure safe, effective high-quality treatment while protecting the confidentiality of patients living with substance use disorder.\n\n issue: aco partnerships with plan sponsors\n cms requests information about existing aco partnerships with plan sponsors, barriers to partnership formation encountered, and ways for cms to assist in reducing barriers and enabling data-sharing.\n\n bcbsa comments on proposed rule for mssp 10/16/2018 page 13 of 13\n\n\n recommendation:\n\n bcbsa believes that a major barrier to coordination is the limited interoperability across stakeholders. we recommend the following ways for cms to assist in enabling data-sharing:\n\n e enforce, where possible, but otherwise promote consistent development, implementation and application of standards and certification requirements for all stakeholders in healthcare (e.g., providers, payers, vendors, technology developers)\n\n e leverage industry standards (e.g., hipaa, hl7 fast healthcare information resources) and standards compliance to motivate healthcare entities to participate only in those data-sharing networks that utilize high-value, robust patient records\n e emphasize consumer experience and raise consumer expectations to promote access to a longitudinal patient record that combines administrative and clinical data free of access fees and data blocking challenges\n e collaborate with other government agencies and the private sector in developing specific guidance, policies and regulations that address systemic barriers to interoperability, including how to measure, identify and remediate instances of data blocking to ensure patients have access to their data and other stakeholders have the necessary access to enable the delivery, payment and operations of healthcare\n e encourage the breaking down of data silos that exist in clinical decision-making by improving standardization in how information should be interpreted (e.g., consistent interpretation of results of medical devices aimed at treating the same condition, consistent and robust fields in ehr systems to account for different provider needs) and continuing to encourage the move from paper to electronic health records\n rationale:\n\n the dual challenges of needing greater data standardization and limited information access are compromising the ability to create efficient and effective partnerships between acos and plan sponsors.\n currently, standards exist in varying degrees of maturity and cms is in a unique position to influence the updating of existing and developing new data standards. this critical function can help to create a common framework in the operations, policy, standards, and technology areas underlying these data exchanges, a significant step to addressing these barriers and improving coordination.\n\n we appreciate your consideration of our comments on the proposed rule for acos and thank you for considering our comments. we look forward to continuing to work with cms on the mssp and other aco programs, particularly since bcbs plans are such active participants in advancing value-based care arrangements. if you have questions, please contact anshu choudhri at 202.626.8606 or anshuman.choudhri@bcbsa.com.\n\n sincerely,\n 2 kris haltmeyer\n vice president, legislative and regulatory policy

hubert h. humphrey building\n 200 independence ave., s.w., room 445-g washington, dc 20201\n dear administrator verma:\n\n we are writing regarding the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) proposed rule, referred to as \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3pathways for success,\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 that would seta new direction for the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\n\n the accountable care organization (aco) model has been instrumental in the shift to value- based care and we support efforts to achieve the long-term sustainability necessary to enhance care coordination for millions of medicare beneficiaries. acos invest millions of dollars of their own capital to make changes to improve quality and reduce cost that require time to produce results.\n\n we are concerned that the proposed rule will negatively impact those acos that voluntarily took on risk within the first three years, specifically those who chose to become a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3track 1 plus\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 within their first three-year agreement with cms. the central minnesota aco is one example of this. we voluntarily took on risk via the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3track 1 plus\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 model in our third year of our first three-year agreement with cms. under the proposed rule, the central minnesota aco will now be considered \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3experienced\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 with risk when we need to renew our agreement with cms.\n this will result in our aco taking on risk beyond the scale of those who have not adopted risk up until this point and doing so without knowing the final results from our only year of risk experience, which we will not know until after the new three-year agreement has begun.\n\n by contrast, track 1 acos that chose to complete two agreement periods for a total of six years without taking on any risk have the benefit of an additional year or 18 months of no risk and are able to gradually transition to level e or the enhanced track. further, acos that just began\n their first three-year agreement and started in track 1 plus will be able to complete three years\n central minnesota aco, llc 1406 6% avenue north | st. cloud, mn 56303 (320) 656-7060\n in track 1 plus and then move to basic level e for an additional five years for a total of eight years of experience prior to moving to the enhanced leve.\n\n we believe that acos who were early-adopters of risk should not be disadvantaged to the point they are forced out. our specific request is that all acos that are currently within track 1 plus, with less than four years of experience with that risk level, be allowed to renew at the basic level e under the proposed rule, until they have at least four years of final data. this a much shorter timeframe than those, who have resisted risk up to this point, will be allowed to pursue under the proposed new rule. yet, it is consistent with the number of years the central minnesota aco expected as the benefit of its bargain when we voluntarily took on risk within our first three years of existence.\n\n we want to be clear that we do not oppose this proposed rule in general, indeed, it is our shared goal to transition acos into risk-bearing entities. we are merely seeking an accommodation under this rule to build the experience necessary to be successful in taking on additional risk in the future.\n\n sincerely, kathy parsons scott rahm, md executive director, central mn

program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6pathways to success proposed rule\n dear administrator verma:\n\n on behalf of the physician and medical student members of the american medical association (ama), i am pleased to offer our comments to the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) regarding the medicare shared savings program (mssp) pathways to success proposed rule. the ama is encouraged by several proposed policies aimed at improving the opportunities for accountable care organizations (acos) to succeed, but also recommends some significant changes. our key comments may be summarized as follows:\n\n e weare pleased that cms proposes to extend aco agreement periods to five years, as this will improve stability and predictability for aco participants. studies of physician experience with payment models have found that constant changes in payment policies and requirements are extremely disruptive to practices.\n\n e as the ama has recommended, cms proposes to better account for changes in aco patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 health status over time. we support the proposal to treat newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries the same way for purposes of risk adjustment. we also encourage cms to consider modifying its policy in the final rule to include adjustments to aco baseline scores, not just benchmarks, as many conditions that may be newly documented when patients are assigned to an aco are not new diagnoses for the patient, and to eliminate the proposed limit of three percent in the amount that risk scores may change during a five-year agreement.\n\n e the ama agrees with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to integrate the track 1+ model into the mssp. the ama joined with the national association of acos (naacos) and other organizations in proposing to cms that the track 1+ model be created following enactment of the medicare access and chip reauthorization act (macra) and we are glad that cms views it as a positive addition to the aco program.\n\n ama plaza | 330 n. wabash ave. | suite 39300 | chicago, il 60611-5885\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 2\n e the ama appreciates that cms is seeking to better define acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 accountability to match their capabilities, as we have long recommended. although we continue to strongly support allowing acos and other alternative payment models (apms) to set risk requirements at a percentage of revenues instead of benchmark spending, we recommend an alternative approach for establishing shared savings and risk requirements based on the aco participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 ability to control key aspects of spending, instead of the proposed low- or high-revenue designations.\n\n e we urge cms to retain the track 1 model, potentially with modifications to encourage greater savings, instead of forcing all acos into two-sided risk models.\n\n e the ama recommends that additional upfront payments for services be made available to physicians participating in acos, beyond those currently available under the medicare physician fee schedule.\n\n e instead of focusing on opioid dosage, quality measurement should focus on promotion of preventive strategies such as screening and treatment for substance use, as well as the quality of pain care. the ama is actively working to reverse the opioid epidemic, and agrees that performance measurement may be one avenue for tracking progress and improving management of patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 pain and substance use disorders; however, the ama has several concerns with the opioid-related measures that cms has proposed for use within the mssp.\n\n e the ama agrees with naacos and other stakeholders that the proposed sharing rates for new acos are too low and will hurt the business case for organizations contemplating participation. surveys conducted by naacos have demonstrated that acos incur very significant start-up costs. even under current mssp policies, it is difficult for many acos to recover their initial investments, and a reduced sharing rate will make this even more difficult.\n\n e the ama supports the proposed flexibilities for acos to choose between prospective and retrospective assignment methods, and the expanded definition of primary care services to be used in claims-based assignment. we agree with naacos that the current voluntary alignment process has been underutilized and that cms should explore policies to improve this process, such as allowing patients to make their designation by calling 1-800-medicare, instead of adopting a new opt-in process focused on patients choosing acos instead of choosing their primary physician.\n\n e the ama appreciates the policy proposals regarding waivers of the skilled nursing facility three-day inpatient stay rule and certain telehealth rules. acos in the shared savings-only model have generated more savings for medicare than those in two-sided models. accordingly, the ama recommends that the policy waivers available to acos that take downside financial risk also be available to acos in the shared savings-only model. these waivers help acos to better manage the delivery of patient care and are as likely to improve care for patients assigned to shared savings acos as they are to improve care for patients assigned to two-sided acos.\n\n e the ama strongly recommends that aco payment incentives under the merit-based incentive payment system (mips) be excluded from aco expenditures for purposes of comparing benchmark to actual spending and calculating each aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s savings and losses.\n this policy unfairly punishes high-performing acos that do not meet advanced apm criteria by\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 3\n requiring them to participate in mips but then counting their mips payment incentives against them. it would have the perverse result of linking better mips scores to reduced likelihood of earning shared savings. cms currently excludes advanced apm bonuses from aco expenditures and it should do the same for mips incentive payments.\n\n e the ama has concerns with the proposal allowing cms to exercise the option to terminate an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participation agreement early if the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s expenditures exceed its benchmark by a certain amount. by potentially terminating acos before they have several years of meaningful performance data available, this provision may have the unintended consequence of removing well-intentioned acos from the program which may go on to achieve savings and make quality improvements in later years.\n\n e the ama encourages cms to allow individual physicians and subsets of physicians within a practice that has a single taxpayer identification number to align themselves with acos as participants. it should not be necessary for all the physicians within a group practice to participate in an aco because one or more members of the group wish to participate in the aco.\n a taxpayer identification number for a medical group is basically a means of billing medicare for claims under the fee-for-service system; physicians should have greater flexibility in how they organize themselves for delivering care within acos and other apms.\n\n the remainder of this letter provides a more detailed explanation for several of our key recommended changes in the proposed rule.\n\n the track 1 aco model should be retained\n under the proposed rule, all acos would be required to move into a two-sided risk model. this proposal should not be finalized. the track 1 model should be retained for four reasons:\n\n e many acos have demonstrated that they can reduce medicare spending without accepting downside risk, and in 2017, track 1 acos achieved greater savings than acos with downside risk in tracks 2 and 3.\n\n e the methodology used by cms can unfairly penalize acos for increases in spending that aco participants cannot control.\n\n e many physicians are using their track 1 participation as a means of participating in the quality payment program.\n\n e cms does not have statutory authority to retire the shared savings-only model and replace it with the basic and enhanced tracks.\n\n acos can achieve savings for medicare without downside risk\n in every year since the mssp was first created, the majority of track 1 acos have reduced medicare spending relative to cms benchmarks without being subject to downside risk. in 2017, the savings produced by the track 1 acos that reduced spending were large enough to offset the increase in spending for those that did not generate savings as well as the shared savings payments to those who did.\n\n the premise underlying the proposed policies is that acos with downside risk achieve greater savings than those with upside-only risk, but the exact opposite was true in 2017\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6the 433 track 1 acos saved\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 4\n an average of $37 per beneficiary, 36 percent more per beneficiary than the track 2 and 3 acos. because there were so many more track 1 acos, the total net savings they generated for medicare ($290 million)\n was more than 12 times the net savings generated by the track 2 and 3 acos ($23 million). based on the experience to date, terminating the track 1 program could increase medicare spending rather than increasing savings.\n\n the benchmarking methodology can unfairly penalize acos\n cms indicates that it is continuing to refine its aco benchmarking methodology. for example, the risk adjustment methodology used to date has failed to account for patient characteristics and changes in those characteristics that can result in the need for more services or more expensive services, which has unfairly penalized acos that have more of these patients. although the current proposal would allow acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 risk scores to change over time, the risk adjustment methodology still does not account for important factors in patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 health care needs, such as functional status and severity or stage of illness.\n\n cms has included some changes to the benchmarking methodology in the proposed rule, such as modifying the use of regional vs. national data and allowing changes in patient health status to be more fully recognized in the risk adjustment system, but there is no evidence yet as to how effective these changes will be, nor does cms propose adjustments for aspects of spending that aco providers cannot control, such as part b drug costs. requiring acos to accept downside risk based on a flawed methodology could penalize them financially for delivering the services their patients need.\n\n track 1 offers a better way to measure and reward quality for many physicians\n cms has recognized physician participation in a track 1 aco as a mips apm. in section 1899(b)(3)(d), congress specifically authorized cms to \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3use alternative criteria than would otherwise apply\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 under the mips program for making payments to acos. many physicians have found that using aco quality measures and reporting on other mips elements through the aco is a more efficient and effective way of measuring and improving the quality of care than is possible through the standard mips program. cms has reported that acos have significantly improved the quality of care for medicare patients, so even if a track 1 aco has not reduced medicare spending, it may well have improved the quality of care for medicare patients and enabled participating physicians to manage quality reporting more efficiently. terminating the track 1 option could therefore have negative impacts on both medicare patients and their physicians.\n\n cms cannot substitute the basic and enhanced tracks for the shared savings-only model\n what cms refers to as \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3track 1\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 is the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3shared savings program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 that was established by section 1899(d)\n of the social security act. under this statutory authority, \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3acos that meet quality performance standards established by the secretary are eligible to receive payment for shared savings.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 although congress also provides the option for cms to use \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3partial capitation\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 or \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3other payment models\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 rather than shared savings to make payments to acos, it is not clear that section 1899 allows cms to replace track 1 entirely with the basic and enhanced tracks.\n\n section iv.e of the proposed rule (83 fr 41927) states that the proposed requirements for downside risk and other changes rely on the authority granted in section 1899(1)(3), but it incorrectly states that section 1899(i)(3)(b) \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3requires that such other payment model must not result in additional program\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 5\n expenditures.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 what this section actually says is that \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3payments to an aco for items and services...for beneficiaries for a year...shall be established in a manner that does not result in spending more for such aco for such beneficiaries than would otherwise be expended for such aco for such year if the model were not implemented.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 in other words, the statute is not referring to a measure of overall program spending, but to the change in spending for each aco.\n\n the current track 1 model meets the statutory requirements for shared savings payments under section 1899(d). section 1899(i) permits cms to use payment models that meet the requirements for partial capitation or other payment models instead of the shared savings approach.' however, one of the requirements for both of these other payment models is that spending cannot be more for such an aco than would otherwise be expended for such aco if the model were not implemented.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 in the proposed basic and enhanced tracks, if medicare spending exceeds an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark, the aco would be required to repay a portion of the difference but not the full amount. because the aco would not be required to repay the full increase, medicare would spend more for that aco than it would otherwise have spent and this does not satisfy the statutory requirement in section 1899(1).\n\n clearly, modifying the proposed basic and enhanced track models to require that each aco repay any spending above its benchmark in full would be an undesirable policy and unattractive to potential applicants, so cms cannot use its proposed downside risk models to completely replace the shared- savings only model. moreover, we believe congress clearly intended to allow acos to participate in a shared savings-only model. consequently, the ama recommends that cms retain track 1, with potential modifications to improve the model and increase the savings for medicare, as described below. cms could use other statutory authorities to implement the other models included in the basic and enhanced tracks, in addition to retaining track 1, similarly to how the track 1+ and next generation aco models were established.\n\n modify rather than retire track 1\n requiring acos to accept downside risk is not the only approach that cms could use to increase net savings to the medicare program from the mssp. for example, one policy expert identified several different options for increasing mssp savings, including:*\n e drop acos from the program if they have not achieved savings after several years;\n e reduce shared savings payments to acos that incur large losses before generating savings; and\n e allow acos to take accountability for the specific types of spending they can control, rather than total medicare spending.\n\n the information provided in section iv.d of the proposed rule (83 fr 41926-27) does not indicate that these or other options were considered. we recommend that cms analyze these and other approaches and develop a comparative analysis of their advantages and disadvantages in lieu of retiring track 1.\n\n\n\n ' social security act \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 1899(i)(1).\n\n ? social security act \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 1899(i)(2)(b) & (3)(b).\n\n

savings program.pdf\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 6\n base risk requirements on aco participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 ability to control spending\n the ama commends cms for recognizing that acos differ significantly in their ability to accept financial risk and for including limits on downside risk based on a percentage of the aco participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 revenue, not just a percentage of medicare spending. this is consistent with the approach that the ama recommended and cms adopted in its regulations defining advanced apms.\n\n we also commend cms for recognizing that aco participants differ in their ability to influence or control total medicare spending, and that adjustments in financial rewards and penalties are needed based on those differences. we do not believe the proposed distinction between \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3low revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 and \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3high revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 acos is an appropriate or effective way of making those adjustments.\n\n it is true that if 90-100 percent of medicare spending on the beneficiaries assigned to an aco represents services delivered by the aco participants, they will be in a better position to control spending than participants in an aco where only 10-20 percent of the spending is associated with the participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 services. however, one cannot conclude that an aco that delivers services representing 30 percent of total spending has significantly greater control over the total than an aco that only delivers services representing 20 percent of spending. neither aco delivers a majority of the services that are driving spending, and the difference in proportion could be entirely due to characteristics of the patients who are assigned to the aco, not to any difference in factors that the aco participants can control.\n\n for example, a physician-led aco whose assigned beneficiaries are younger and less frail is likely to have lower levels of spending on hospitalizations and post-acute care than other acos, and therefore the physicians\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 revenue will represent a higher share of total spending in the aco. this would not indicate that the physicians have a greater ability to control spending or to accept risk than physicians in other acos; indeed, the exact opposite may be true, because the primary way many acos have achieved savings has been through reducing the use of expensive post-acute care services. another example would be that aco participants who administer expensive infused medications in their offices may have revenues representing a higher share of total spending than in acos organized by physicians who do not administer infused drugs. the first set of physicians cannot better control drug prices or pay penalties to medicare if drug prices increase faster than cms benchmarks than the second aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s physicians.\n\n the proposed rule states that the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3low revenue/high revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 distinction is intended to measure differences in the ability of the aco to control total spending, but the discussion suggests that the real goal is to identify which aco participants have more financial resources and are less likely to be bankrupted by repaying losses to cms. we are concerned that the proposed rule is so narrowly focused on \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3risk\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 that it overlooks the original intent of the aco program to enable physicians and other health care providers to deliver patient care in better and more affordable ways.\n\n to actually \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3measure the degree of control that acos have over total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for their assigned beneficiaries,\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 as stated in the regulation, the ama recommends that cms do so directly instead of using problematic proxies such as the proportion of revenues. this could be done by dividing services or spending into several categories reflecting the relative levels of control that aco participants would be expected to have over services, and then assigning different savings thresholds and sharing levels to each. for example, spending could be divided into the following categories, reflecting decreasing levels of control by the aco participants:\n\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018\n page 7 e services delivered by the aco participants; e services ordered by the aco participants; e potentially avoidable complications of services delivered or ordered by the aco participants; and e all other services.\n\n under this approach, if a large share of the spending on an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s assigned patients is associated with services that are delivered or ordered by the aco participants, or with potentially avoidable complications of those services, that aco would be in a much better position to control total spending than in an aco where most of the services are being delivered or ordered by other providers. both acos could be held accountable for the spending on the services their participants can control, while avoiding penalizing them for decisions made by other providers that the patients have chosen to use.\n\n this approach is consistent with the one payment option congress authorized in section 1899 that cms has not implemented\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3partial capitation model.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 in section 1899(i)(2), congress specifically gave cms the authority to place an aco \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3at financial risk for some, but not all, of the items and services covered under parts a and b, such as at risk for some or all physicians\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 services or all items and services under part b.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 many physician groups have experience with using this approach in commercial insurance and medicare advantage plans.\n\n allow additional upfront payments to aco participants for patient services\n we were pleased that cms acknowledged in section iv.c.1.a.(2) (83 fr 41919) that acos must make significant upfront investments in enhanced services and care management infrastructure that can only be recovered through shared savings payments. as the ama has pointed out repeatedly in its comments to cms on apms, one of the biggest barriers physicians face in delivering higher-value care is that there is no payment at all in the medicare physician fee schedule (or inadequate payment) for many high-value services, such as development of treatment plans and employment of nurse care managers. in addition, if participants in the aco reduce the use of current billable services and substitute unbillable services, they will lose revenues in the short run and may not be able to wait until cms makes a shared savings payment to recoup those losses.\n\n for acos to reduce medicare spending without harming quality of care for patients, participating physicians need to be paid appropriately for delivering the right mix of services to patients, not just receive a financial bonus when fewer services are delivered. moreover, if an aco is going to be accountable for total medicare spending, the aco participants should have the flexibility to be paid upfront for the services they need to deliver in order to reduce spending and improve quality.\n\n ideally, each physician in an aco would be able to participate in one or more apms specifically designed to support high-value care for the types of patients they treat. unfortunately, cms has only implemented a small number of physician-focused apms, and most physicians do not have the opportunity to use an apm to improve care delivery. until more primary and specialty care apms are available, it is essential that the mssp provide the opportunity for physicians participating in an aco to be paid differently. cms did provide additional resources to some acos through the advanced payment aco model and the aco investment model, but these programs are no longer available to new applicants. the proposed expansion of telehealth services will likely be very helpful to acos, but this will address only one aspect of services that are currently undercompensated.\n\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 8\n we recommend that cms create a mechanism whereby physicians in acos can receive upfront payments to support services that are currently not paid for under standard medicare payment systems.\n physicians in the aco would identify what types of payments they need based on the specific ways they plan to change the delivery of patient care. accountability for spending on these payments could be achieved in two different ways, depending on the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s overall accountability for spending:\n\n e track 1 acos would be responsible for repaying all or part of the upfront payments they receive if specific aspects of utilization or spending were not reduced. this is similar to the approach that cms is currently using in the comprehensive primary care plus model.\n\n e for acos in two-sided models, the upfront payments would be counted toward the overall spending for which the aco is accountable, so if the additional payments do not result in more than offsetting savings, the aco would be required to pay back cms some or all of what they received. this is similar to the approach cms has defined in the downside risk track of the oncology care model.\n\n quality measures related to use of opioids\n the ama is actively working to reverse the opioid epidemic, particularly through the activities of the ama opioid task force, which was formed in 2014 and includes 26 national medical specialty and state medical associations, the american osteopathic association, and the american dental association.\n performance measurement may be one avenue by which we can track progress and make improvements to reduce the opioid epidemic. the ama supports every effort underway to meet this need. however, we have concerns with the opioid related measures cms proposes for use within the mssp. quality measurement needs to focus on utilization of preventive strategies such as screening and treatment for substance use, as well as pain management, i.e., how well patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 pain is controlled, whether functional improvement goals are met, and what therapies are being used to manage pain. if aco patients are receiving appropriate care for substance use disorders and if their pain can be well-controlled and function improved without the need for high doses of opioids over a long period of time, those may be indicators of good patient care, but a reduction in opioid dose alone is not an appropriate goal.\n\n e nof #2940: use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer\n as the ama has highlighted in our 2019 physician fee schedule proposed rule comments, the ama does not agree with the fundamental premise of a measure that focuses only on daily dose and duration of therapy involving prescription opioid analgesics because on its own it is not a good indication of quality patient care. in fact, since the centers for disease control & prevention (cdc) guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain was issued, there have been many reports of patients who have been successfully managed on opioid analgesics for long periods of time being forced to abruptly reduce or discontinue their medication regimens with sometimes extremely adverse outcomes, including depression, loss of function, and even suicide. there has been considerable discussion of these unintended consequences at meetings of the hhs interagency pain management best practices task force.\n\n identifying those patients for whom daily morphine milligram equivalents (mme) prescribed are considered high may serve as an indicator of whether a patient is at risk of overdose and should be co-\n the honorable seema verma october 15, 2018 page 9\n prescribed naloxone, but it is not a mark of higher quality care. the cdc recommendations? allow physicians to document a clinical rationale or justification when suggested dose levels are exceeded; yet, the existing measures that focus on mme do not capture if a justification exists nor do they provide a well-defined and targeted denominator.\n\n we are also concerned with the feasibility of directly calculating the measure from the electronic health record (ehr). the electronic clinical quality measure (ecqm) is reliant on a function that is not consistently supported by ehr vendors, and participation with the measure would require additional costs or vendor fees placed on the aco. it is our understanding that the ehr does not uniformly capture mmes and this calculation would be necessary to populate the measure\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s numerator. there are also internet, ios and android-based apps that perform this functionality, but to use them the aco would need to manually enter patient information and calculate the mme, introducing the possibility for human error. in addition, terminology and code mappings play a big role in how well an ehr-based calculator works, but due to the lack of consistency and standardized code mappings the results produced are not very reliable. many physicians are not yet able to electronically prescribe controlled substances, and those that can do not have seamless integration between their controlled substance e-prescribing and ehr systems, which would present additional problems in capturing the needed ecqm information.\n\n if cms implements a measure that focuses on mme it must adequately define the patients for whom higher doses of opioids may be appropriate. otherwise, the measure may provide invalid representations of physician performance and cms would be sending a signal to physicians that the government does not think physicians should prescribe these medications, and substituting its judgement about the risk-benefit tradeoff for those of physicians. therefore, cms should consider and explore alternative measures or ones that provide complementary information on the quality of care in managing substance use disorders and/or pain, for example, nof #2597 for assessing substance use screening and intervention.\n\n e nof #2950. use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer\n the ama has concerns with the proposed inclusion of \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 (nqf #2950) in the mssp as it was developed with the intention of determining the quality of care provided by prescription drug health plans and not for acos. the measure as currently specified requires health plan medical and pharmacy claims and member enrollment information and the data may not be readily available across all acos given their varying composition and access to pharmacy claims data. comprehensive assessment of the feasibility of collecting and reporting these data at the aco level must be determined. for example, for those mssp participants that provide care across state lines or have patients that receive care from others outside of the aco, it is unclear whether they can access data to ensure that prescriptions were not received outside of the network. ensuring that acos can collect the data needed to satisfy the measure requirements will inform and allow thorough evaluations of the reliability and the validity of the performance scores. for example, it is not clear what minimum sample sizes are needed to ensure that performance scores could be considered reliable across acos. the testing completed by the pharmacy quality alliance included more than 700 medicare part d prescription drug plans, eight state-based medicaid prescription drug plans, and one commercial health plan. the ama believes that this measure must be adequately specified and tested across acos prior to its implementation in mssp.\n\n\n\n 4 centers for disease control & prevention. guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain. 2016. available at:\n

cancer\n the ama has the same concerns with the proposed inclusion of \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 (nqf #2951), given the dearth of information on the feasibility of collecting and reporting pharmacy claims data and the lack of specifications and testing for the intended level of analysis. in addition, on review of the performance scores provided during the nqf endorsement review, we question whether this measure has adequate variation in scores to enable meaningful comparisons in performance since the testing results showed that there was less than 2.5 percent difference between the minimum and maximum rates for the medicare population and less than\n5.5 percent for the medicaid population. if similar rates will be found when applied to acos, we believe\n that it will be difficult to distinguish better versus worse care and it also must be adequately specified and tested across acos prior to its implementation in mssp.\n\n conclusion the ama appreciates the opportunity to provide our comments and thanks cms for considering our\n views.

file code cms-1701-p dear ms. verma:\n\n the medicare payment advisory commission (medpac) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the medicare proposed rule entitled: medicare program: medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6pathways to success (federal register, page 41786, volume 83, number 160, august 17, 2018). the rule proposes major changes to the medicare shared savings program (mssp). in view of the complexity of the accountable care organization (aco)\n program and the demands on your staff's time, we appreciate the efforts you are taking to improve the program.\n\n on balance, the proposed rule represents a major advance for the mssp, and the commission supports many of the proposals, in particular the proposed

(in contrast, under a one-sided risk model an aco can share in savings but has no liability for losses.)\n the commission has long supported moving acos to two-sided risk models with prospective assignment because they provide stronger incentives for acos, protect the medicare trust funds, and make it possible to provide regulatory relief\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6and thus more innovative care delivery models.\n the commission has stated this position in numerous reports to the congress and comment letters on aco regulations. !\n a recent study suggests that the benefit the medicare program derives from one-side risk aco models is larger than the difference between aco benchmarks and spending might indicate,\n\n\n ' medicare payment advisory commission. 2015. comment letter to cms on medicare shared savings program:\n accountable care organizations proposed rule. february 2. medicare payment advisory commission. 2018. report to the congress: medicare and the health care delivery system. washington, dc: medpac.\n\n seema verma administrator page 2\n prompting the authors to call for a longer glide path for one-sided acos.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 but two-sided risk models provide stronger long-term incentives for acos to make practice pattern changes that improve quality and reduce costs. for example, practice pattern changes could include efforts to better manage transitions of care and help beneficiaries choose higher quality and lower cost post- acute care. in two-sided models, those efforts will be rewarded with higher rates of shared savings than in one-sided models, and failure to make such changes could well result in shared losses.\n two-sided models also help protect the medicare trust funds. for example, in a two-sided model, savings resulting from random variation are balanced by shared josses from random variation; in a one-sided model, they are not. further, in a one-sided model, regulatory relief\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6such as waivers of anti-kickback rules\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6intended to spur innovative changes in the delivery system might instead have the unintended effect of increasing the volume of services. this is because, in a one-sided aco model, the persistent incentive in the fee-for-service (ffs) system to increase volume will not be balanced by the responsibility for total medicare spending inherent in two-sided aco models. in the commission\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s view, relief from regulations designed to counter the ffs incentive to provide more services should be extended only to acos at two-sided risk.\n\n for the first six years of the mssp program, providers were not required to transition to two-sided risk. the proposed rule would require that a gradual movement toward two-sided risk start in the middle of 2019. however, a two-sided risk model need not require an aco to take on an inordinate amount of risk. for example, by the end of the first five years in the basic track, the proposed model has a limited level of downside risk and higher shared-savings rate than shared- loss rate. thus, although acos will have to take on risk in the proposed model, that risk is constrained. in the end, providers may be willing to accept a gradual movement to two-sided risk in exchange for the potential of greater upside gain.\n\n in this letter we comment specifically on the following proposed changes:\n e the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3glide path\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 toward two-sided risk for acos e favoring \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3low-revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 acos over \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3high-revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 acos\n e allowing acos to choose prospective or retrospective assignment of beneficiaries into the aco\n e blending of benchmarks based on historical and regional spending\n e allowing risk scores of existing aco beneficiaries to increase faster than the national average, with a cap on growth of 3 percent\n e allowing beneficiaries to opt into acos\n proposed change: defines a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3glide path\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 for acos to bear downside risk\n cms proposes to discontinue the current mssp tracks (tracks 1, 2, and 3), and the track 1+ aco model and replace them with two new tracks for acos. the first new track for acos is a basic\n\n\n ?

(the maximum loss amount in level e is defined to meet cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s standard for nominal risk under the quality payment program. this allows the model to qualify as an advanced alternative payment model. in the proposed rule, if cms changes the nominal risk standard, the maximum loss amount in level e will change automatically to match it.) under the proposed rule, acos would have no downside risk for at most two years.

however, those acos ending their current agreement period on december 31, 2018, can extend six months.\n\n the net result of replacing track 1 and track 2 acos with the new basic track is that acos will be required to bear two-sided risk on a faster timetable than is required under current policy.\n cms estimates that this will cause acos that are not confident in their ability to achieve savings to drop out of the program or not enter it. cms projects that by 2028 there will be 109 fewer acos in mssp than would have been in the program under current policy. however, cms also projects that moving from one-sided to two-sided models and the other proposed changes will lower program spending by $2.24 billion between 2019 and 2028.\n\n cms also proposes to terminate acos with poor financial performance over two years.\n specifically, \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3if the aco is negative outside corridor for a performance year, we propose that we may take any of the pre-termination actions set forth in \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba425.216. if the aco is negative outside corridor for another performance year of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s agreement period, we propose that we may immediately or with advance notice terminate the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participation.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 the stated purpose of the terminations would be to remove acos that are not in the program to improve quality and reduce cost, but rather for other factors such as \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3receipt of program data and the opportunity to enter into\n seema verma administrator page 5\n certain contracting arrangements with aco participants and aco providers/suppliers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 (proposed rule, page 41836).\n\n comment\n the proposed redesign of the mssp program is broadly consistent with the commission\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s position that acos should eventually transition to two-sided risk.* it provides a gradual path to risk and stronger incentives for acos to change practice patterns and invest in care coordination. as the proposed rule notes in the regulatory impact analysis, there would be fewer acos than otherwise might be anticipated under current policy in the mssp, but those that are in the mssp would be more likely to control expenditures for the medicare program and make real efforts to improve care. as we have stated in the past: \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3the goal of the mssp should be to create the conditions that will reward efficient acos that can create real value for the medicare program, its beneficiaries, and the taxpayers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6not to maximize the number of acos or to ensure that every provider can join an aco.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 the commission therefore supports the proposed glide path.\n\n however, cms may want to consider modifying its proposal by increasing the shared savings rates in the basic track. the proposed shared savings rates in the basic track are 25 percent in level a and b, gradually increasing to 50 percent in level e. the low rates in the first years could discourage acos that might be good candidates from participating in the basic track. it might be difficult for acos to justify making the investments necessary to organize and improve care if the shared savings rates are that low. increasing the shared savings rate to 50 percent may increase participation by acos. the increase must be balanced against the risk to the medicare program of paying for random variation in the one-sided models. because the acos would only be in one- sided models for two years, there would be minimal risk to medicare from increasing the shared savings rates and doing so might encourage acos to enter the program and make the investments necessary to succeed.\n\n another modification cms should consider is that, if acos are taking two-sided risk, they should not be required to leave the program if they are not generating savings for one or two years. for many smaller acos (those with under 20,000 beneficiaries), there is expected to be substantial random variation in spending. in some years, they will generate shared savings and in others they will generated shared losses. if an aco is improving the efficiency of care delivery, eventually its shared savings will outweigh its shared losses. one or two years of shared losses cannot be seen as a definitive indicator of performance given the small number of beneficiaries in most acos.\n\n with these modifications to the proposed shared savings rates, and eliminating the requirement to achieve savings, the proposed glide path would achieve a better balance between encouraging participation by acos and creating the conditions for acos to have the incentives to succeed. the commission supports the glide path and its movement toward two-sided risk; the glide path would be strengthened by these modifications.\n\n\n\n 3 medicare payment advisory commission. 2018. report to the congress: medicare and the health care delivery system. washington, dc: medpac.\n\n 4 medicare payment advisory commission. 2015. comment letter to cms on medicare shared savings program:\n accountable care organizations proposed rule. february 2.\n\n seema verma administrator page 6\n proposal: favoring \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3low-revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 acos over \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3high-revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 acos\n in the rule, cms defines a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3low-revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 aco as having medicare ffs revenue of less than 25 percent of the medicare part a and part b spending of its attributed beneficiaries and a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3high- revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 aco as one that has ffs revenue of greater than or equal to 25 percent of its attributed beneficiaries\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 spending. cms makes this distinction on the assumption that a low-revenue aco is less financially capable of taking on risk than a high-revenue aco. (as the proposed rule shows in its analysis, low-revenue/high-revenue is a proxy for clinician-only acos and acos with both clinician and hospital participants.) the proposed rule further states that \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3it becomes clear that low-revenue acos are saving cms money while high-revenue acos are resulting in additional spending by cms before accounting for market-wide and potential spillover effects\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 (proposed tule, page 41917).\n\n cms uses the greater savings from low-revenue acos and the lower ability of these acos to take on risk to justify favorable treatment. in the rule, a low-revenue aco can be in the basic track for two agreement periods, while a high-revenue aco cannot. (former track 1 acos are allowed one year in the basic track at the b level of risk sharing, and then must transition though the other levels and have two years at the level e of risk sharing.) \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u0096\u0091\n comment\n we do not support more favorable treatment of low-revenue acos or making a distinction between low- and high-revenue acos for payment purposes. if high-revenue acos in the one- sided aco model (track 1) are resulting in additional medicare spending, they should be moved into two-sided models, which will prevent them from further increasing spending. the new glide path will do that. if low-revenue (or physician-only acos) expect to achieve savings, they should be willing to move into the level e model in the glide path, which has minimal risk and potentially greater reward.\n\n in addition, level e (the track 1+ model) in effect already favors lower-revenue acos. this is because in level e the maximum loss amount is the lower of 8 percent of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 ffs revenue or 4 percent of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark. for a low-revenue aco, 8 percent of its participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 ffs revenue will be lower than 4 percent of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark. thus, it will have less at risk than a high-revenue aco. moreover, a physician-only aco could benefit even more if its participating clinicians receive the a-apm incentive payment. that payment is 5 percent of each clinician\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s professional services revenue. this would essentially reduce the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s collective maximum risk to 3 percent of its medicare ffs revenue (8 percent minus 5 percent). thus, cms does not need to explicitly recognize or reward low-revenue acos in level e; they already are advantaged by the terms of the model and its intersection with the a-apm incentive.\n\n\n\n > the proposed rule also distinguishes between acos that are experienced with performance-based risk aco initiatives and those that are not. inexperienced acos can start basic in level a, experienced must start in level e or go directly to enhanced.\n\n seema verma administrator page 7\n favoring \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00bflow-revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 acos over \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00bfhigh-revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 acos, or physician-only acos over acos that include hospitals, is not necessary and could lead to unintended consequences. although low- revenue or small acos may be less able to absorb risk, their maximum risk may in fact be quite limited in some cases. in addition, they could conceivably partner with a larger organization that could absorb the financial risk, such as an aco aggregator. the concern about unintended consequences is that a high-revenue aco could be encouraged to selectively redefine its component tax identification numbers (tins) to change itself into a low-revenue aco. for example, an aco with a common tin for its hospital and its physician practice could create separate tins for each and drop the hospital tin from the aco. thus, we do not support creating the distinction between high- and low-revenue acos and treating them differently. it would be better not to extend preferences to any one model of aco and instead let the market determine the best form for the local area.\n\n whether or not low-revenue (or physician-only) acos are saving more money than integrated hospital\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6physician acos is an important question but does not justify favorable treatment.\n physician-only acos have, in effect, a larger incentive to reduce hospital-provided services than physician\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6hospital acos because those services represent forgone revenue for the hospital.\n therefore, one might expect physician-only acos to be more successful at reducing hospital admissions or emergency room use. the proposed rule finds greater savings relative to benchmarks from low-revenue acos in 2016, but the analysis may not present the full picture because it does not take into account the fact that physician-only acos are more common in markets where service use per beneficiary has been historically high. we previously found that the historical level of service use in the area where the aco is located was a larger factor than physician-only participation for predicting aco savings relative to benchmarks in earlier years of the program. \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u0096\u0091 more recent literature, which computes savings relative to a counterfactual (that is, relative to what spending would have been for beneficiaries assigned to acos if those acos had not existed), finds greater savings from physician-only acos.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 however, even if physician-only acos generate some small degree of additional savings on average compared to hospital-based acos, the magnitude of the savings is not large enough for the medicare program to favor physician-only acos over integrated physician\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6hospital acos for payment purposes. rather, medicare should be neutral to the specific configuration of acos, and instead design and implement policies to reward the most effective acos in a given market.\n\n if the program is neutral to high- and low-revenue acos, the question arises: would all acos be allowed to stay in the basic track level e for five more years as proposed for low-revenue acos, or would they have to move to the enhanced track as proposed for high-revenue acos? because the enhanced track has stronger incentives for cost control, an argument can be made that all acos should move to the enhanced track after one five-year period in the basic model. this would be consistent with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal for high-revenue acos. however, if cms concludes that acos with a low-level of risk (e.g., one-sided acos and track 1+ acos)\n have generated savings for the medicare program, all acos could be allowed to operate in the\n\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ab medicare payment advisory

which risk is limited to level e risk (8 percent of the aco participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 medicare revenue in many cases). level e is a two-sided model and is consistent with the commission\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s position that acos should be in two- sided models. in addition, although it has enough downside risk to encourage acos to control costs, the modest level of risk in the model may be more palatable to a wider range of acos.\n\n proposed change: allow acos to choose retrospective assignment\n cms proposes to allow acos to choose each year between prospective and retrospective assignment of beneficiaries into the aco.* the bipartisan budget act (bba) of 2018 gives acos in track 1 and track 2 (which currently have retrospective assignment) the opportunity to choose prospective assignment starting january 1, 2020. however, track 1 and track 2 aco models (those with retrospective assignment) are eliminated under the proposed rule. therefore, the provision would be moot if cms were to require prospective assignment in both tracks of the redesigned program. instead, cms proposes to implement this provision by giving acos the choice to move from prospective assignment to retrospective assignment, a choice not contemplated by the provision in the bba.\n\n cms proposes this choice in response to comments on previous rules asking for more flexibility on assignment. but previously cms pointed out that it would be administratively burdensome to do so. for example, in the proposed rule cms discusses how the baseline for an aco will have to be recomputed each time the aco switches assignment methodology.\n\n comment\n the commission does not support allowing acos to choose retrospective assignment. the proposal would increase complexity, lead to inappropriate incentives, and reduce incentives for acos to generate enough patient satisfaction to maintain relationships with high-need patients. as we discussed in our 2015 comment letter, a better alternative is to require prospective assignment of all aco beneficiaries.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5\n prospective assignment will reduce complexity for several reasons:\n\n e it identifies the beneficiaries for whom the aco is responsible at the start of the year.\n\n e patients now have the option of voluntarily assignment to an aco by selecting a primary care physician. aligning the voluntary election process and claims-based assignment on a prospective basis would contribute to this certainty.\n\n\n\n 8 we use the term retrospective assignment as shorthand for \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 it means that assignment is based on the beneficiaries\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 claims during the performance year rather than claims in the year preceding the performance year.\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u0096\u0091 medicare payment advisory commission. 2015. comment letter to cms on medicare shared savings program:\n accountable care organizations proposed rule. february 2.\n\n seema verma administrator page 9\n e it makes it possible to know which beneficiaries are in the aco and are eligible for waivers such as the 3-day snf policy and telehealth.\n\n prospective assignment also reduces inappropriate incentives for two reasons:\n\n e retrospective assignment encourages acos to shift patients to non-aco doctors if they have an anticipated need for an expensive procedure such as a knee replacement. this is because the patient will lose assignment to the original aco and the expense of the procedure will no longer be the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s responsibility. acos with prospectively assigned patients do not have that incentive because the patient\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s spending for the entire year is the acos responsibility regardless of where the patient gets care.\n\n e under retrospective assignment, an aco has an incentive to spend money attracting healthy patients who do not need services, such as by offering rewards (e.g., gift cards) to beneficiaries to come in for a visit at the end of the year (e.g., a wellness visit) if they have not received any care that year. this keeps the patient assigned to the aco and the aco knows spending for that patient for the year will be very low.'\u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ab\n finally, prospective assignment rewards acos that build patient loyalty. the aco is responsible for care provided for the entire year and likely in the following year and thus has a strong financial incentive to create enough patient satisfaction so that the patient remains with that aco rather than move on to using other physicians. we strongly oppose the proposal to allow acos to choose retrospective assignment.\n\n proposed change: create benchmarks based on a blend of the historic spending on the aco physicians\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 patients and regional spending levels\n cms proposes using a blend of historical aco spending and regional ffs spending to set initial and rebased aco benchmarks, with a maximum weight placed on the regional adjustment of 50 percent. (the blend varies over time and by the relation of aco spending to regional spending.)\n under current policy, cms bases initial aco benchmarks (those at the beginning of an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first contract period) on the historical level of costs of patients assigned to physicians in the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s tax identification number(s). cms computes rebased benchmarks (those at the start of a subsequent contract period) on a blend of historical and regional spending.\n\n these two different approaches (historical vs. regional ffs spending) arise because repeatedly rebasing benchmarks on the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own historical costs is unsustainable in the long run: as aco performance improves over time, benchmarks for future performance years reflect that improved performance and become more difficult to meet. an alternative to using acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 historical data to set benchmarks is to use regional spending as the benchmark. however, a problem with using only\n\n\n !0 this incentive could also complicate future evaluations in which a comparison group of patients is assigned to non- aco physicians. beneficiaries who are not in acos and who had little or no care in the prior months will not be paid by their doctor to come in at the end of a year and could have no physician visit as a result. beneficiaries who have not had a physician visit are not assignable to a physician and thus will not be in the comparison group. thus, low-cost beneficiaries who would be included in an aco will not be included in the comparison group, potentially making acos look more effective.\n\n seema verma administrator page 10\n regional spending is that historically low-spending practices could reap large shared savings payments without changing behavior, while practices that serve high-cost beneficiaries may drop out of the aco program.\n\n in addition to setting initial and rebased benchmarks, cms updates benchmarks each year to reflect expected growth in spending. to update benchmarks from year-to-year, the rule proposes to use a trend factor that is a blend of regional trends in spending growth and national trends in spending growth. (under current policy, only the national trend is used.) the weight placed on the national trend is equal to the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s share of the beneficiaries in the market, and the remaining weight will be the weight for the regional trend. this has the effect of reducing the weight of the local trend in markets where the local trend is dominated by the aco itself.\n\n comment\n as we have discussed in our june 2018 report, basing benchmarks purely on historical spending is not sustainable. blending of aco-specific historical benchmarks and regional ffs benchmarks is a reasonable approach.'' because, there is no a priori perfect weighting of aco historical spending and trends and regional spending and trends to achieve a benchmark, the method proposed by cms is reasonable. however, to limit the risk of high-cost acos dropping out of the program, the share of the benchmark attributed to regional costs should start out low and be refined as the results of mssp are evaluated over time.\n\n in contrast to the use of benchmarks to calculate the distribution of \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3shared savings\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 to individual acos, evaluations of the mssp program as a whole should be made relative to a counterfactual, which is the best estimate of what spending on attributed beneficiaries would have been if the mssp program did not exist. aco benchmarks, which are designed to create prospective incentives for individual acos to reduce spending and improve quality, will differ from retrospectively determined counterfactuals. however, the design of the benchmarks and ongoing evolution of the program should be informed by analyses using counterfactuals to ensure that the benchmarks both create effective incentives for the acos and result in savings for the medicare program. the commission plans to expand its analyses of aco performance relative to counterfactuals over the next analytic year.\n\n proposed change: adjust performance year benchmarks by as much as 3 percent to reflect the change in health status of all assigned aco beneficiaries\n to account for changes in the health status and demographics of an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s beneficiary population while mitigating concerns about increased diagnostic coding efforts, the mssp currently risk- adjusts benchmarks differently for newly assigned aco beneficiaries and continuously enrolled aco beneficiaries. for newly assigned beneficiaries (those who were not assigned in the year preceding the current performance year), cms adjusts benchmarks to reflect differences between the newly assigned beneficiaries\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 and the baseline beneficiary population\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s hierarchical condition\n\n\n '! medicare payment advisory commission. 2018. report to the congress: medicare and the health care delivery system. washington, dc: medpac.\n\n seema verma administrator page 11\n categories (hcc) risk scores\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6treflecting both health status and demographic factors (e.g., age, sex). in contrast, for continuously enrolled beneficiaries, cms only uses hcc scores to decrease benchmarks when the aco enrollees\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 reported average health status improves (i.e., lower average hcc scores). benchmarks for continuously enrolled beneficiaries are only adjusted upward for changes in demographic factors, not for increases in their risk scores. aco leaders we have spoken to believe it is not equitable for benchmarks to be lowered when hcc scores decline, given that benchmarks are not raised when hcc scores increase.\n\n cms proposes to address these concerns by using all aco beneficiaries\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 hcc scores to risk- adjust benchmarks. the average change in hcc scores would be capped at +/\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 3 percent between the last baseline year and any performance year. cms believes this approach could reduce the incentive to avoid beneficiaries with complex health care needs and provide more incentive to assume performance-based risk. cms analyses suggest the proposal would have resulted in higher benchmarks for most acos compared with current policy.\n\n comment\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to use the hcc scores of an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s entire population to risk-adjust benchmarks allows for misaligned incentives. the proposal would allow aco benchmarks to increase due to either more aggressive coding efforts or worsening health status of aco beneficiaries. conversely, acos would potentially be penalized when patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 health is maintained or better managed\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6key objectives of the aco program. cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s observation that acos have modestly increased coding efforts\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6even under the limited incentives to do so under current policy\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6suggests that some acos may intensify those efforts given the potential 3 percent increase in benchmark in the proposal.\n\n to improve the incentives in the mssp, we suggest that cms neither increase nor decrease benchmarks based on continuously enrolled beneficiaries\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 hcc scores in a performance year. in tandem with prospective beneficiary assignment, cms should adjust benchmarks based on the demographic factors of continuously enrolled beneficiaries and the hcc scores of newly assigned beneficiaries. that is, it should continue current policy except it should no longer adjust benchmarks downwards if the hcc scores of continuously enrolled beneficiaries decrease. these policies would improve the alignment of aco financial incentives with beneficiary health status, allowing acos to benefit financially when they do a good job of maintaining patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 health.\n\n proposed change: beneficiary can opt into an aco\n traditionally, cms has assigned patients to an mssp aco based on the plurality of patient visits to physicians. assignment is claims-based. starting in 2018, beneficiaries could designate a primary care clinician. if that clinician was a participant in an aco, the beneficiary would be assigned to that aco regardless of claims history. the rule proposes an additional method of assignment in which a beneficiary would actively select (opt in) to an aco (rather than selecting an individual physician).\n\n seema verma administrator page 12\n opting-in would be similar to enrolling in an ma plan. beneficiaries would have an annual window to opt-in or withdraw their opt-in. the rule also discusses requiring that the beneficiary opting in also have at least one visit with a primary care physician in the aco. in addition, the rule discusses a hybrid approach where a beneficiary can be aligned by naming their primary care physician or opting into an aco, or by claims if the beneficiary had \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3at least seven primary care services from the aco.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5\n the rule notes that setting benchmarks would be more complicated because beneficiaries who opt in would differ from other beneficiaries. in particular, they would have to still be alive at the start of the performance period, meaning their historic costs would not have any end-of-life care.\n therefore, their growth in spending would have to be benchmarked against similar beneficiaries.\n the rule also notes that they would need a special risk-adjustment process under the hybrid system for expected costs of those who have received seven primary care services.\n\n comment\n we believe that the predominant share of beneficiaries will continue to be assigned via claims rather than the beneficiary voluntarily identifying a primary care physician or opting into an aco.\n in general, voluntary alignment is a reasonable (though rarely used) option, and we support the concept of voluntary alignment.!? however, the commission does not support allowing beneficiaries to opt into acos.\n\n the benefit of an opt-in would be very small because it is extremely unlikely that many beneficiaries who were not already assigned through claims or by designating a primary care provider would choose to opt into an aco. the potential negative effects could be high. for example:\n\n e every year we conduct focus groups with medicare beneficiaries and ask them a series of questions to assess their knowledge and understanding of acos. we have found that almost no beneficiaries are familiar with acos. any policy that allows beneficiaries to opt in would require a great deal of beneficiary education and generate a large amount of beneficiary unease.\n\n e one of the primary advantages of acos over ma plans is their lower administrative costs.\n once an opt-in arrangement is started, aco administrative costs would increase as would cms administrative and program integrity costs. cms has stated it would have to monitor marketing to make sure the plans are not specifically marketing to those with low expected healthcare costs.\n\n\n\n '2 tn 2018 4,314 beneficiaries went to the cms website and designated an aco clinician as their primary care provider. of those, only 339 would not have been assigned to the same aco using claims. this is a very small share of the over 10 million beneficiaries assigned to acos. the rule proposes that once a primary care physician is selected, that selection will remain until the beneficiary returns to the website and selects another primary care physician. this could be modified to return to claims-based assignment if the beneficiary had no visits with their designated clinician within some number of years.\n\n seema verma administrator page 13\n e setting benchmarks would become more complicated due to opt-in patients potentially having different expected cost growth than the average beneficiary.\n\n given these problems with opt-in and its limited benefit (if any), we do not support adding beneficiary opt-in as an option for acos. cms should continue with its policy of ensuring that aco alignment does not reduce in any way the value of the medicare benefit to beneficiaries.\n once that is ensured, beneficiaries can continue to be assigned via claims and voluntary alignment with their primary care physician.\n\n conclusion medpac appreciates the opportunity to comment on the important policy proposals from cms.\n we also value the ongoing cooperation and collaboration between cms and medpac staff on\n technical policy issues. we look forward to continuing this productive relationship.\n\n if you have any questions, or require

services:\n\n community care partnership of maine (ccpm), an accountable care organization (aco) in our third year of participation with the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and its member organizations write to you today regarding the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 (cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096) recent proposal medicare program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 pathways to success (cms-1701-p).\n\n as supporters, early adopters and earnest participants in value-based health care systems that reward quality while working to decrease costs, we appreciate your work to update the mssp in an effort to ensure its long-term success. to this end, we are very supportive of the introduction of regional benchmarking methodology and the proposed increased duration of contract performance periods from three to five years. additionally, we are grateful for your renewed focus on reducing administrative burdens related to participation in the mssp and requisite reporting. however, we have concerns related to the proposed rule and what we believe will be unintended consequences significantly impacting the success of the program, discouraging participation, and diminishing the broader shift to value-based care and payment. we have outlined below the key areas of concern and impact to our organization, often times aligning with the positions taken by the national association of acos (naacos).\n\n risk adjustment cap\n ccpm recently engaged actuarial support in reviewing the impact of the proposed risk adjustment cap. ccpm was significantly impacted by the proposed cap. ccpm has invested a significant amount of time and resources over the past two years and continues to work diligently to improve the capture of the most up to date and specific diagnosis codes for our patients. this work is vitally important across all payers, including mssp, medicare advantage and commercial plan partners. this proposed rule puts in place an arbitrary cap, disincentivizing continued improvement in the accurate and detailed capture of diagnosis codes by our providers.\n in addition, the application of a risk adjustment cap disincentivizes continued growth of acos in offering membership to organizations serving higher acuity patient populations, or organizations who have not been working to accurately reflect diagnosis code capture in the past and may have artificially lower risk patients upon entry.\n\n ccri) community care\n the reduction in time new acos have in shared savings only models from six (6) to two (2) years and reducing the shared savings rates from 50% to 25% - a naacos survey found that over 70% of all acos facing mandatory risk in 2019 under the proposed rules were likely to leave the program. in addition, performance year 2017 mssp results showed that track 1 acos achieved more savings per beneficiary than acos in the two-sided mssp models. community care partnership of maine (ccpm) is comprised of 12 otherwise unaffiliated organizations (9 federally qualified health centers and 3 community hospitals)\n located throughout the state of maine. ccpm\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s member organizations are located predominately in rural areas, acting as safety-net providers, and caring for some of the most vulnerable patient populations. ccpm is currently participating in our third performance year under our first mssp agreement period. ccpm was successful in realizing shared savings in both the first performance year (2016) and second performance year (2017). in establishing ccpm\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s infrastructure and working to further integrate ccpm\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s member organizations, ccpm had anticipated participation in the full 6 years of mssp track 1. while track 1 is a one-sided risk model, it is important to note the significant investments acos make in start-up and ongoing costs, such as those related to clinical and care management, health it, population analytics and tracking, building of reserves to prepare to take on downside risk and aco management and administration. it takes significant time and financial support to stand up the necessary aco operations in order to be informed and successful in taking on downside risk. while ccpm has made incredible progress in improving the quality and cost of care delivered to our patients, as evidenced by ccpm\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s performance during the first two performance years, ccpm has not yet had the opportunity or time to build the necessary infrastructure to be prepared to take on downside risk. ccpm therefore fears the proposed rules will lead to an inability to continue participation in mssp, a program that has offered incredible benefit to the aco and our patients. ccpm joins naacos in requesting that cms modify the proposed terms, to allow more time for acos to participate in a shared savings only model and to apply a shared savings rate of at least the current 50 percent. as an aco in the final year of our first performance period, ccpm would request cms allow currently participating acos to have the option of completing the full 6 years of track 1 before being required to take on downside risk. this would provide ccpm and other acos in their first agreement period to receive the full and necessary benefit of the program, as was intended in forming the aco. with the benefit of a full 6 years, ccpm and other currently inexperienced acos would be appropriately prepared to participate in downside risk models.\n\n high revenue distinction\n as referenced above, ccpm is comprised of 12 member organizations, serving as safety net providers in low income and rural areas throughout the state. under the proposed rules, ccpm would be categorized as a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3high revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 aco. we believe this to be an unintended consequence of the high v low revenue calculation process, and one that adversely impacts ccpm and our options related to available mssp paths. ccpm therefore joins naacos in requesting that cms modify the proposed terms to remove or significantly modify the high revenue distinction, in order to ensure acos that are appropriately engaging and incentivizing hospital engagement in value-based care delivery are not penalized for doing so successfully.\n\n ccri) community care\n six month proposed extension of contract period\n ccpm\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s current agreement period ends on december 31, 2018. under the current proposal, ccpm would then have the opportunity to participate in a 6-month extension of our current contract period, followed by a 6-month abbreviated performance period. the two 6-month periods would create a significant and costly administrative burden for ccpm and other participating acos, with the need to track against two attribution lists, and confusion around performance period terms. in addition, a significant amount of resources are currently pulled from ccpm\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s lean member organizations to support gpro on an annual basis, and there is concern that ccpm will not have the resource capacity to accommodate two reconciliation periods in a single year. ccpm joins naacos in requesting that cms allow acos with contract terms ending on december 31, 2018 to participate in a full year extension of the current contract terms. this request is in line with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s stated commitment to reducing the administrative burden of reporting and participation in the mssp. in addition, revising to provide a full year extension would encourage continued participation and allow acos the time necessary to make an informed decision related to mssp track selection.\n\n quality measure changes ccpm requests cms consider retention of the following quality measures:\n e aco-12 medication reconciliation post-discharge e aco-15: pneumonia vaccination status for older adults e aco-41: diabetes; eye exam e aco-30: ischemic vascular disease: use of aspirin or another antithrombotic\n in addition to recognizing the value of ensuring improved performance in the above areas of care delivery, ccpm and other participating acos have built workflows and necessary reporting infrastructure to support success in the above measures. as an example, ccpm purchased several diabetic eye cameras in an effort to ensure patients received their diabetic eye exam, successfully improving ccpm\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s overall rate from the 30\" to now 60\" percentile.\n\n in addition to retention of the above measures, ccpm also requests reconsideration of a proposed change to measure aco-13: screening for future fall risks by replacing it with aco- 47: screening, re-assessment, and plan of care to prevent future falls. while ccpm understands the rationale for the change, the shift from requiring only documentation of the screen to now requiring creation of a plan, developing a discrete field within the electronic medical record (emr), as well as development of the workflow to support entry of the plan creation is going to require significant time and resources. ccpm would request that cms delay on elimination or replacement of current quality measures, given the significant amount of changes being proposed, and instead add additional measures as needed for 2019.\n\n ccrim) kanensnr or mane\n nurse practitioners and physician assistants as primary care providers for purposes of attribution\n finally, ccpm is compelled to mention our continued request that cms consider nurse practitioners and physician assistants as qualifying primary care providers for purposes of member attribution. in maine, the current physician shortage and difficulty in recruiting physicians results in significant use and reliance on nurse practitioners and physician assistants to provide necessary preventive care and chronic disease management to our patients. ccpm member organizations rely heavily (if not at times entirely) on the able support of nurse practitioners and physician assistants within their primary care practices, resulting in an inconsistent ability to capture medicare beneficiaries for purposes of aco attribution.\n\n ccpm offers this feedback in hopes that it will be used to support the agency\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s work to update this vital medicare alternative payment model. our main goal in offering this feedback is to enable successful acos such as ccpm to continue participation in the mssp while creating sustainable, long-term aco models for medicare. we hope that the administration shares these goals and look forward to working with cms to ensure that acos thrive and continue to provide high quality healthcare services, while reducing the total cost of care for medicare beneficiaries.\n\n sincerely, ()\n\n c saf ke \\\n sandy nesin, esq.\n chief

organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\n\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\n\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our community.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nswen e laser, md\r\nanesthesia associates of

centers for medicare and medicaid services,\n signature partners appreciates this opportunity to submit comments in response to the medicare shared savings program (mssp) notice of proposed rulemaking (cms- 1701-p). signature partners has participated in the program since 2015 and currently has two accountable care organizations, signature partners in health and signature network. our acos have had significant impacts on the quality of care provided to medicare beneficiaries and we will continue to emphasize the importance of quality care in the years to come.\n\n signature partners has developed comments regarding the proposed rule, which are included below. we hope that you will consider our input as you make the final decision regarding the future of the program.\n\n\n1. shared savings rate: the proposed rule lowers the shared savings rate for acos\n with no downside risk from 50% to 25%. this will deter participation.\n therefore, we suggest maintaining a 50% shared savings rate for acos in levels a and b of the basic track. this will incentivize new acos to join the program while maintaining participation of renewing acos that have a preference for having little to no downside risk.\n\n the proposed shared savings rate is a significant decrease for existing acos like signature partners which means less investment in population management and care coordination.\n\n in addition, reducing the shared savings rate will result in challenges with provider buy-in. provider buy-in has been crucial to the success of our acos as our physicians value the program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s emphasis on quality of care as a result of collaborative efforts across practices.\n\n\n2. distinction between high and low-revenue acos: the proposed rule calculates\n loss sharing limits according to whether acos are low- revenue or high - revenue. the loss sharing limits in the proposed rule are structured in a manner that forces acos with hospital participants such as ours to take on more risk due to being deemed as high-revenue acos. we believe that there should be a level playing field for all acos as this distinction would discourage acos from\n 3190 fairview park drive, suite 900 - falls church, va 22042 7855,744.6895 f703.207,7063 signaturepartners.org\n signature\n\n\n recruiting hospital participants. we ieee geauct inova health system which is northern virginia\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s largest health system and this distinction would counter our tireless efforts to encourage various providers throughout our network to coordinate care.\n\n the proposed rule also states that high-revenue acos would be required to advance to the enhanced track after one year in basic level e as opposed to low-revenue acos that would be permitted a second agreement period in basic level e. again, this promotes inequity within the program and we believe that by removing the distinction between high and low-revenue acos, all acos would have the opportunity to move into risk in a manner that is most appropriate for them.\n\n\n3. beneficiary attribution methodology: beneficiaries within the attributed\n population may have a low number of member months for various reasons that are beyond the control of the aco. for example, our acos bear the full costs for beneficiaries that are attributed to primary care providers in our acos but live out of state for half of the year. we have no control over the services these beneficiaries receive in other states and it is difficult to manage their care.\n therefore, cms should consider a mechanism to account for such challenges in the assignment of the attributed population to avoid negatively affecting an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s financial and quality performance.\n\n\n4. promoting interoperability (pi): we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to remove aco\n measure 11 (percent of primary care physicians who successfully meet meaningful use requirements) and rely on attestation to evaluate the use of certified electronic health record technology (cehrt). this will significantly reduce the reporting burden on providers at our various practices.\n however, we urge cms to clarify how this will affect the scoring for the merit- based incentive payment system (mips) and whether acos would be required to report for the pi category or if weights for the pi category would be redistributed equally to the quality and improvement activities categories.\n\n if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us using the information provided below. we appreciate your support and guidance during our participation in the program.\n\n sincerely,\n nnifer oppong program manager, mssp signature

verma,\r\naugusta care partners is an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our community.\r\nsincerely,\r\nallison baroco,

rule\r\ndear administrator verma,\r\naugusta care partners is an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our community.\r\nsincerely,\r\nwilliam b. mckibbin\r\naugusta surgery, inc.\r\naugusta care partners     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n

2018 seema verma administrator centers for medicare & medicaid services department of health and human services 7500 security blvd baltimore, md 21244 re: comment on the \"medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pathways to success\" (\"pathways to success\") as published in the federal register on august 17, 2018. dear ms. verma on behalf of memorial hermann health system and the memorial hermann accountable care organization (\"mhaco\"), we are submitting the following comments to the pathways to success proposed rule. as a participant in the medicare shared savings program (\"mssp\") since 2012, mhaco has been a leader in obtaining share savings for cms. we are very interested in continuing to have success in this program, and would like to offer the following comments with respect to the proposed rule.\n1. e&m reimbursement: although not specially addressed in the rule, we would like to offer \n the suggestion that the reduction in pay for primary care physicians under cpt code 99214 and 99215 is inconsistent with the goals for pathways to success. by creating a disincentive for primary care physicians to treat complex patients with multiple chronic illnesses, which require more time and documentation,it makes it more difficult to ensure that these patients will be seen and have their care appropriately managed and may increase overall cost attributed to the patient thus adversely affecting the aco and cms.\n2. timing. in lieu of a six month extension to the current mssp period, with a new start date \n of july 1, 2019, we recommend starting the new program on january 1, 2020. this will give current aco participants additional time to evaluate whether we have the appropriate structure in place, implement processes to comply with new regulations, and make necessary changes to our networks. in particular, acos that end december 31, 2018 should be extended for a one year period on the current track.\n3. snf waiver. we recommend that the snf waiver be available for level b in addition to \n page 2 of 3 setting, often at a lower cost, and to tailor personalized care plans where additional hospital days is not necessarily the best option. for this reason, all mssp programs should be able to utilize this waiver.\n4. level for existing acos. we urge cms under the newly proposed rule, to allow aco's \n which have previously participated in track 1 entrance under the basic track at level b. specifically, acos in track 1 should not require to go into level c immediately. this will give those acos the appropriate amount of time to be fully ready for risk-based performance enhancing the probability for success of the program.\n5. mlr. we recommend cms provide a choice of fixed or variable msr/mlr at all levels of \n basic. once programs are further developed, it may become more apparent on which methodology makes the most sense for cms, participants, and beneficiaries, but initially we believe offering the choice provides the best pathway for success within a reasonable structure.\n6. risk adjustment. please consider in your proposed adjustments to the risk adjustment \n methodology aligning with algorithms and processes which sync up with those used for the medicare advantage populations. by creating the ability to compare risk and illness burden for both medicare advantage and mssp populations, acos can tailor programs and education around them without creating unnecessary analytic or documentation burdens for providers while improving the care coordination, disease management and support structure for the patients with resultant improved outcomes and reduced unnecessary cost.\n7. quality measure's. please consider standardizing quality measures and other reportable \n metrics between mssp and medicare advantage and also reducing the number required. many mssp participants will have physicians in both programs, and it would substantially increase time and complexity for physicians and acos to track separate measures. additionally, aligning the specific quality measures for mssp and medicare advantage stars allows acos to tailor programs and education around the mesures, create interoperability in measurement and reporting, and reduces the analytics burden on the aco and their providers. specifically, we request that mssp adopt the medicare advantage stars clinical measures.\n8. beneficiary opt-in. we agree that there are advantages to permit a beneficiary to opt-in \n page 3 of 3\n9. incentive payments.  we are supportive of the proposed incentive payment of up to $20 \n for each assigned beneficiary for each qualifying pcp service, however we would like to see greater detail around what qualifies and how this would be administered.\n10. pcp selection.  we are pleased with the proposed pcp selection criteria which would allow \n a beneficiary to voluntarily designate any aco professional as their primary care provider. however we would caution that this may actually have unintended consequences to the overall goal of the program in the event many choose specialist providers who are unaccustomed to managing populations holistically. \u0000 prevention, screening and coordination of care between multiple specialists is key to care improvement and population health. primary care physicians are trained to practice in this manner whereas many specialists may not be. this would place undue burden on both the patient and the aco to manage care appropriately. in addition we would request greater clarity on the mechanics of how this process would be operationalized for each aco.\n11. risk sharing. cms may consider increasing the level for upside savings in basic tracks. \n\n", "0259": "while the cms revised aco and bundled payment models reflect the current leaderships continued commitment to develop solutions that better align payment with outcomes, these solutions themselves, at present, continue to fall short of the above objectives. there are three principal reasons for why this is so and three major steps that the cms can take to revise and amend their most recent payment and performance initiatives.\r\n\r\nfirst, the new programs fail to establish an alternative to the same pay-for-volume, reimbursement-driven approaches that have stagnated the industry for decades. such approaches depend on the cms reimbursing providers according to how well they deliver a set menu of services, selected by the cms bureaucracy. because the cms measures the outcomes of these services according to how much they cost providers, and not necessarily how much they benefit patients; and because these costs are assessed relative to each services corresponding fee-for-service price, the cms new payment models remain predicated on a baseline fee-for-service payment structure. in this way, the cms continues to prioritize cost over outcomes and encourages providers to do the same.\r\n\r\nsecond, because these new programs are still fundamentally rooted in cost and not quality, nearly all of these programs force providers to prioritize their own reimbursements over their patients health. as a result, these new payment models reward providers for betraying their true priorities: delivering the right care, in the right setting, for the right patient, at the right time.\r\n\r\nthird, these new initiatives still severely curtail patient and provider choice, not only in terms of the services provided but also in terms of the services site. site neutral payments would allow physicians to determine the optimal location for delivering a given therapy to a given patient, unencumbered by site-contingent deviations in provider reimbursement. it is therefore a critically needed component of patient-centered care. it's also critically disturbing that many in the industry have responded so antagonistically to the cms recent site-neutral payment proposals. this overwhelmingly negative outcry reveals that the true locus of many stakeholders concerns lies not in their patients, but in their own pocketbooks. i urge the cms to reflect on the extent to which their payment models reinforce this flawed incentive structure.\r\n\r\ni also urge the cms to realign provider incentives by applying the following changes to their current aco and bundled payment models. first, enforce rapid uptake of higher levels of risk by implementing exclusively double-sided risk models; second, encourage patient and provider flexibility through enacting site-neutral payment policies; and third, reimburse care episodes in a way that focuses on overall outcomesnot upfront costs.\r\n\r\nthe decision to prioritize outcomes over price tags, as the most meaningful measure of a care episodes success requires expanding the types of care available within a payment model. it further requires extending the time horizon for evaluating treatment outcomes. this is especially true for the cms relatively new oncology care model, whose strengths and shortcomings are emblematic of virtually all the agencys present bundled payment initiatives.\r\n\r\nwhile it may seem simpler in the short term to delimit the focus or duration of a payment episode to a very narrow scope, the long-term value of these programs and the services they cover can only be accurately gauged when we can evaluate their long-term effects.\r\n\r\nbundled pricing can work for a number of treatment episodes, but only if the cms constructs better bundles. with regard to the new ocm, for instance, a comprehensive, integrated and patient-specific cancer treatment plan should be controlled by cancer type and stage. it shouldn't be exclusively triggered by the onset of outpatient chemotherapy, and it should focus on more than just cost reductions. measuring the cost of one finite and discrete intervention against its standard fee-for-service price is not going to move us closer to a value-based model. even more fundamentally, it's not going to get us nearer to pioneering and investing in the life-saving drugs and discoveries that will eventually eradicate our most pernicious diseases.\r\n\r\ni've written several pieces on the cms recent, and highly commendable, efforts toward payment and delivery reform. two of these pieces, published in ajmc, concern the newest ocm and aco models specifically. each article details a discrete set of problems with the programs it addresses, and each proposes a series of focused solutions. the above comments reflect several of the detailed insights contained in these articles as well as in my book, bringing value to healthcare, all of whose prescriptions are based on over 25 years of experience consulting with major stakeholders as well as newer entrants in the healthcare industry.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n

payment policies under the physician fee schedule and other revisions to part b for cy 2019\n dear administrator verma:\n\n the healthcare quality coalition (hqc) welcomes the opportunity to offer comments on the implementation of the medicare shared savings program within the accountable care organization\n framework.\n\n the hqc is comprised of hospitals, physicians, health systems and associations committed to value- based healthcare. organized in 2009, the hqc supports efforts to create a sustainable medicare system through incentivizing high-value care. we believe value-based payment policies can drive better quality, lower cost of care, and reduce overall costs for the medicare program. the hqc strongly supports continued implementation of payment systems that reward value over volume, and we ate pleased to provide comments on cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed rule on the mssp-aco programs, which offers substantial policy changes for the upcoming year.\n\n participation tracks to performance-based risk\n e overall, the hqc supports the newly re-structured mssp program tracks.\n\n e we are concerned regarding the proposed shortening of the upside-only aco models. it is important to move quality-based care forward while recognizing different providers have different starting points in the aco program.\n\n the proposed rule makes a number of modifications to the mssp infrastructure. cms proposes to create a path to risk in the basic track that compromises five levels: upside-only model for one or two years (levels a and b), and three levels of progressively higher risk and potential reward (levels c, d, and e). in doing so, the existing tracks 1 and 2 of the mssp are discontinued, and instead a\n mission: \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3the hqc strives to transition healthcare delivery and payment from wasteful, volume-dtiven incentives to a\n value-based (higher quality, lower cost) system. the hqc advocates advancing healthcare payment policies that\n encourage high value care and appropriately compensate for outcomes through measureable quality and cost criteria.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5\nwww.qualitycoalition.net info@qualitycoalition.net (608) 775-1400 @healthcarequall\n\n basic track with a pathway to risk and an enhanced track that mirrors the current track 3. there would be no new applications for the track 1+ model. the proposal extends the agreement period from three to five years, with july 1, 2019 as the earliest available start date.\n\n under the basic track, eligible acos would begin under a one-sided model and incrementally phase-in risk and potential reward over the course of a single agreement period. this approach is referred to as a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3glide path\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 to risk. the enhanced track, which is based on the mssp\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s existing track 3, would offer acos the highest level of risk and potential reward. the rule proposes to require acos to enter one of these two tracks for agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years. for agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019, the length of the agreement would be five years and six months. in subsequent years, the length of the agreement period would\n be five years.\n\n participation options \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 glide pathways e overall, the hqc supports the newly developed glide pathways. it is critical the new pathways are clear and consistent for participants and prospective enrollees to\n understand their journey to risk.\n\n the proposed rule provides different participation options based on aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s status. the criteria helps place an aco into the glide pathway. one criterion is determined based on the experience of a participant. as such, an aco is determined to be experienced if either of the following conditions apply:\n e the aco previously participated in a performance-based medicare aco initiative or deferred entry into a second mssp agreement period under track 2 or track 3.\n e 40% or more of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s providers participated in a performance-based medicare aco initiative or were part of a deferred renewal arrangement in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n\n inexperienced with performance-based risk medicare aco initiatives is defined as those that meet all of the following criteria:\n\n e the aco is a legal entity that has not participated in any performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, and has not deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under a two-sided model; and\n e less than 40 percent of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or in an aco that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under a two-sided model, in each of the five most recent performance\n years prior to the agreement start date.\n\n another criterion is based on revenue. low-revenue and high-revenue acos are defined based on\n the aco participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 part a and b fee-for-service revenue for the most recent 12 months of\n available data, as follows:\n\n mission: \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3the hqc strives to transition healthcare delivery and

@healthcarequall\n\n e high-revenue aco: if the aco participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 recent total part a and b ffs revenue (which may include revenue for beneficiaries not assigned to the aco) is at least 25% of the total medicare part a and part b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s assigned beneficiaries for the 12-month period.\n\n e low-revenue aco: if the participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 recent total part a and b ffs revenue is less than 25% of the total medicare part a and part b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s assigned beneficiaries for the 12-month period.\n\n assignment methodology e overall, the hqc supports the proposed opt-in procedures. in addition, we would support the ability to aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s to confirm assignment and patient relationship with the aco on an on-going basis.\n\n the proposed rule seeks to permit acos to annually elect their beneficiary assignment methodology. cms uses this rule to explore options for developing a possible opt-in methodology to assign beneficiaries to acos, but stops short of actually proposing a methodology. cms explains its belief that an opt-in methodology could allow acos to better target care coordination and provide an incentive to acos to compete against one another. cms also reports that stakeholders that support this methodology believe it promotes beneficiary free choice and engagement and makes assignment more patient-centered.\n\n in its discussion of possible opt-in methodologies, cms explains the difference between voluntary alignment and an opt-in methodology. with voluntary alignment, beneficiaries directly opt into care by a specific primary clinician, but only indirectly opt in to the clinician\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s aco by doing so. with opt-in assignment, beneficiaries would opt-in directly to a specific aco.\n\n waivers e the hqc supports expansion of the snf waiver and relaxing restrictions on providing telehealth services to aco participants.\n\n expand access to waivers of the skilled nursing facility 3-day rule and certain restrictions on the coverage of telehealth. acos with prospective beneficiary assignment already qualify for the waiver.\n cms also proposes to extend the waiver by allowing application of it to snf services furnished under swing bed arrangements between critical access hospitals and certain small, rural hospitals, if those services fall under a written agreement between the swing bed operator and a waiver-eligible\naco. cms proposes to make these changes applicable beginning with waivers approved for\n performance years beginning on july 1, 2019 and subsequent years.\n\n consistent with changes included in the biba, restrictions on the originating site and geographic location would not apply to payment for telehealth services for these entities. these changes would allow payment for telehealth services originating in a beneficiary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s home and from geographic mission: \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3the hqc strives to transition healthcare delivery and payment from wasteful, volume-dtiven incentives to a value-based (higher quality, lower cost) system. the hqc advocates advancing healthcare payment policies that encourage high value care and appropriately compensate for outcomes through measureable quality and cost criteria.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5\nwww.qualitycoalition.net info@qualitycoalition.net (608) 775-1400 @healthcarequall\n\n locations that would otherwise be prohibited. however, no facility fee would be paid to the ofiginating site when services originate from the beneficiary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s home, and no payment would be made for a service delivered in the home if it was not appropriate to do so. the expanded telehealth policy would apply to the proposed risk-bearing acos listed above, if they continue to elect prospective beneficiary assignment. cms also proposes to offer the expanded telehealth policy to current track 3 and track 1+ model acos. the hqc supports the expansion of the snf waiver and restrictions on telehealth services to aco participants as a positive step toward improved care delivery.\n\n beneficiary incentives e the hqc supports allowing aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s to provide beneficiary incentives for participating.\n e however, the $20 annual allowable amount is quite low. we would support an increase in the level of incentive, and suggest alignment with the next generation aco program at $20 allowable per six months.\n\n enable acos to establish beneficiary incentive programs. cms proposes that eligible acos that establish an approved beneficiary incentive program would be allowed to provide incentive payments directly to assigned beneficiaries upon their receipt of qualifying primary care services3 from an aco professional with a primary care designation or a federally qualified health center (fqhc) or rural health center (rhc). in accordance with the biba, cms proposes that the incentive payment could be up to $20, updated annually. the payment would be required to be identical for each ffs beneficiary, unrelated to any other health insurance policy or plan, and made within 30 days of the delivery of each qualifying service. cms proposes to allow acos to vary the incentive payment type (e.g., gift cards or checks but no cash), but to require acos to disburse payment directly to eligible beneficiaries.\n\n the hqc appreciates the ability to provide an incentive to participation that is reasonable. however, we believe $20 per year is a very low amount. instead, we suggest alignment with the next generation program of $20 per six months or $40 annually as a better figure providing an incentive to participate and be part of the care delivery model.\n\n risk and benchmarking methodology\n e the hqc is concerned regarding the capped 3% beneficiary risk score over a five- year period. we suggest increasing the cap to 5%.\n\n e the hqc supports the removal of the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3continuous\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 and \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3newly\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 assigned methodology in favor of the hierarchical conditions category adjustment policy.\n\n e we would also support a rebasing of the benchmark following the first six months of the agreement period. this would better account for the population entering into the program.\n\n mission: \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3the hqc strives to transition healthcare delivery and payment from wasteful, volume-dtiven incentives to a\n value-based (higher quality, lower cost) system. the hqc advocates advancing healthcare payment policies that\n encourage high value care and appropriately compensate

rule factors regional expenditures into benchmarks beginning in the first agreement period but reduce the weight of regional factors in calculating the benchmark. under current regulations, cms applies a regional adjustment to acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 historical benchmarks to rebase them for acos entering a second or subsequent agreement period in 2017 or later years. the percentage adjustment is phased in over time and ultimately reaches 70 percent. due to the more accurate benchmarks cms believes it has achieved using this method, cms proposes to incorporate regional expenditures into the historical benchmarking methodology starting with the first agreement period for all acos entering the program beginning on july 1, 2019. when calculating the historical benchmark for an aco in its first agreement period, cms would weigh the three benchmark years \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 the three calendar years prior to the start of the agreement period \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 at 10 percent, 30 percent, and 60 percent, respectively. this differs from the equal weights that are used in resetting the benchmark for acos entering a second or subsequent agreement period.\n\n risk adjustment: cms is proposing to do away with the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3newly assigned\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 and

category (hcc) risk adjustment for all assigned beneficiaries between the benchmark period and the performance year. the resulting risk score would be subject to a symmetrical cap of positive or negative three percent over the length of the agreement period, for agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years. the five-year agreement creates concern regarding the adjustments. the hqc has concern over the capping of risk adjustment and inflation adjustment. increasing the cap on risk adjustment would eliminate some concerns of the agreement period. a pre-determined inflation trend would also eliminate some concerns with the proposed methodology. in addition, we would support a re-basing of the benchmark after the first six months of the downside risk track to better reflect spending and case\n mix.\n\n program data and quality measures e the hqc continues to support alignment and implementation of the

measures that are topped out and/or do not\n provide value to patient care.\n\n cms does not propose changes to the basic methodology for determining aco quality performance. however, cms solicits input on ways to enhance the program's measure set. this includes ways to align the mssp measure set with the agency\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3meaningful

part d data. all three measures are endorsed by the national quality forum (nqf), and their nqf identification numbers are included below. all three measures exclude patients with cancer, and those enrolled in hospice in order to focus the measure on the most appropriate population.\n\n the hqc continues to support the alignment between various quality and value-based programs. in addition, we are supportive of the agency strategy to focus on measures that are linked to improved patient outcomes. the focus should be on measuring value, not measuring volumes.\n\n proposed changes to certified electronic health record (ehr) use and measurement e we support alignment of ehr policies between the mssp and the quality payment program. this helps support transition and management for organizations that participate in mips-aco scoring standard and advanced alternative payment models (apms).\n\n cms proposes several changes to align participation in the mssp with provisions in the qpp that promote the use of certified ehrs and the interoperable access, exchange and use of health information. cms proposes to add a requirement that all acos demonstrate that at least 50 percent of eligible clinicians participating in the aco use a certified ehr to document and communicate clinical care to their patients or other health care providers. this requirement would be included in the attestation and certification upon application to participate in the mssp and in the annual certification process. cms proposes that the threshold requirement would be effective with the performance year beginning jan. 1, 2019.\n\n cms also proposes to require acos in tracks or models that meet the financial risk standard to be advanced apms to demonstrate that at least 75 percent of eligible clinicians in each participating advanced apm use a certified ehr to document and communicate clinical care to their patients or other health care providers. cms states that this proposal aligns with the proposal in the cy 2019 physician fee schedule proposed rule to increase the threshold level for certified ehr use by eligible clinicians participating in advanced apms under the qpp. cms also states the agency reserves the right to monitor, assess and/or audit an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s compliance with the proposed requirement and take compliance actions when acos fail to meet or exceed the required certified ehr use threshold. the proposed threshold requirement would be effective with the performance year beginning jan. 1, 2019.\n\n conclusion\n on behalf of the hqc, we appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the implementation of the mssp-aco program. we urge cms to work together with physicians, groups, hospitals, associations, and coalitions to ensure value-based payment programs are working in tandem to achieve the goals of better quality and lower cost.\n\n mission: \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3the hqc strives to transition healthcare

baseline year 3 (by3) to the performance year (py) and to perform this calculation separately for each category. the current proposal would effectively apply less than a 3% overall benchmark adjustment if any of the four categories have less than a 3% increase. this means that an aco could have well over 3% increase in overall risk but have significantly less than a 3% adjustment allowed.\r\n\r\nwe recommend that the 3% cap on the risk score adjustment be applied combining all eligibility categories instead of being applied at each individual eligibility category. we believe that it is more appropriate to apply the cap at the aggregate level in order to accurately reflect the changing risk and mix of an aco's population. under this method, the overall benchmark adjustment would be +/- 3% of the combined aggregate claims experience before applying the risk adjustment.\r\n\r\nwe also believe the 3% adjustment over a 5-year performance period is too low, especially in the latter years of the agreement. population changes and changes in health status of the population could be dramatic over a five-year time-frame. 3% adjustment over that entire five year period is too

differently. however, i disagree with the assumption that both models need to be rapidly pushed toward risk. the evidence presented in seema verna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blog post shows that independent

"0268": "cms must seriously consider options strictly for rural providers when finalizing the proposed rule (cms-1707-p). the proposed levels of risk are too high and will drive rural providers and hospitals from the mssp. rural hospitals and practices are risk averse for very good reason. operating margins are too small to allow for taking on risk. rural health runs on tight budgets and limited human and capital resources. in addition to the limited, and often negative, operating margins, rural healthcare also cares for a sicker and older medicare population. the proposed rule must create a glide path specifically for rural acos.\r\nthe proposed rule attempts to create a glide path for lower revenue aco participants to take on risk. however, the proposed basic and enhanced tracks require acos to assume levels of risk unrealistic for rural hospitals, practices and independent providers. the mssp aco program is an important model for rural america. most rural acos are a combination of rural entities. it is rare to find a rural aco comprised of only independent practices. the mssp is the only model that includes multiple aspects of the healthcare system, as opposed to other value-based models that only pertain to a single practice or organization. the mssp provides the legal framework to allow rural hospitals and providers to discuss cost and create care initiatives for the entire community while still maintaining their independence.\r\nmany rural aco participants are working to decrease costs on lower than average benchmarks and smaller attributed patient populations. it is very difficult to achieve savings with the high msr smaller acos are assigned. the sicker populations and lower benchmarks mean an increased potential for extreme variability in performance year over year. one or two beneficiaries ending up in the emergency department may mean the difference between savings and losses for a rural aco and its participants. the variability of the mssp made more variable by the proposed changes makes it unrealistic for rural hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural health clinics, federally qualified health centers and independent practices to continue participating in this program. the current proposals will create a rural-urban divide in risk-based contract participation. as currently proposed, only urban hospitals and systems will have the financial reserves to assume the proposed levels of risk.\r\nhospital board members, especially rural hospital board members, will never approve any level of risk tied to the proposed degree of variability, particularly when tied to a decreased share in savings. rural hospitals and by extension the rural independent practices they support are unable and unwilling to assume the proposed levels of risk. cms must alter the proposed changes to provide opportunity for rural hospitals to participate in the mssp without risking the financial viability of their organization. cms committed to bringing a rural healthcare focus to cms healthcare delivery and payment reform initiatives in the rural health strategy published in early 2018. this commitment is missing from the proposed rule. rural is mentioned throughout the document but there is no discussion of a rural-specific focus on participation criteria.\r\nrural aco participants need access to a upside only or one-sided track in the mssp. the current track 1 is the only viable opportunity for rural acos to participate in a medicare value-based model. there are other options, but the mssp aco remains the only option for independent rural healthcare organizations to work together to address the cost and quality of care. but even with this model, the potential for earning enough shared savings to build sustainable cash reserves for taking risk is non-existent.\r\ncms must develop exclusions specific to rural acos: exclusion from the proposed basic glide path and enhanced track; exclusion from proposed schedule for moving between basic and enhanced; and, exclusion from high and low revenue designations.\r\ncms must define rural acos as: aco shall not include a hospital as an aco participant or aco provider/supplier unless the hospital is an inpatient prospective payment system hospital with fewer than 100 beds or a critical access hospital; and, 75% or more of the acos participants are located in counties designated as rural or frontier.\r\ncms must provide the following opportunities for rural acos: 50% share of savings; basic rural: upside-only for two 5-year agreement terms with aggregate show of savings and quality attainment at the end of each agreement period; and, enhanced rural: option to move to a graduated risk model when financially ready. rural acos taking on risk would have three years at proposed basic level c then a year each in proposed basic levels d and e. the share in savings would be set at 50% for each year of the agreement term.\r\nthe full comment is

revenue definitions, cms failed to account for three things:\n1. the fixed cost of doing business is higher in rural areas than in urban areas; \n\n2. rural hospitals have demonstrably smaller net operating profit margins than urban hospitals; and, \n\n3. any sort of revenue threshold must consider fixed cost and operating margin. \n [4] critical access hospitals, rural demonstration hospitals, and fqhcs. aco c is comprised of critical access hospitals,  demonstration  hospitals,  fqhcs,  rhcs,  and  independent  practices.  these  three  acos  are representative of rural acos. the revenue and expense amounts are likewise representative of rural acos.\n [5] participants the necessary time to understand the new tracks and make an educated decision on whether to continue in the mssp. the final rule most likely won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be published until later in 2018, providing at most 6 months to truly determine whether the new tracks are a financially viable option for current and new aco participants. the proposed 6 months is not enough time to make such an impactful decision. it will cause many more acos to drop out of the program than currently expected. the july 1, 2019 start date fails to provide adequate time to analyze the final rule, explain the new model to  participants  and  gain  participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 buy-in  to  the  new  mssp  model. the  proposed  rule  includes substantial changes to the mssp. acos need more than 6 months to adequately vet participation options and potential losses/savings. additionally, the proposed 6-month extension is causing aco participants to back out of the mssp because of the level of uncertainty that now pervades the program. the two 6-month performance years will cause increased burden on providers, practices, acos and cms. they will require a duplication of administrative tasks, data compilation and analytics, benchmark and attribution calculations, and quality reporting. these tasks are expensive and time consuming. requiring acos and cms contractors to complete these tasks twice is burdensome and needlessly expensive. the  proposal  to  prorate  the  shared  savings/shared losses  based  on  the first 6-month  period  of participation fails to account for habitual behavior of medicare beneficiaries. most annual wellness visits are performed in the 3rd and 4th quarters of the calendar year. a calendar year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s q1 and q2 are typically low-performing quarters. the majority of americans wait to visit the doctor until their deductible is met, which usually occurs towards the end of the calendar year. medicare beneficiaries follow this practice, even  with free preventive  services  like  annual  wellness  visits. annual  wellness  visits  are  the  primary opportunity for aco participants to capture quality measures and attribution; two key aspects of overall aco performance. using only q1 and q2 will result in inaccurate quality and financial performance. cms should provide an additional opportunity for aco participants to join a new aco for py2019 because of the short period of time between the proposed rule being published (august 9, 2018) and the final deadline for adding participants for py2019 (september 28, 2018). the proposed rule caused confusion and uncertainty in the mssp and many aco participants missed the date to join other acos due to this confusion and uncertainty. this additional date should be set 1 month after the final rule publication date. cms should institute a january 1, 2020 start date for new agreement periods, offer a 1-year extension to participation agreements ending on december 31, 2018, and provide an additional opportunity to add aco participants to the py2019 participant list.\n1. acos that entered a first or second agreement period with a start date of january 1, 2016, may elect \n to extend their agreement period for an optional fourth performance year, defined as the 12-month period from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019; and,\n2. the first agreement periods under the new participation options and all other applicable proposed \n changes will go into effect for a january 1, 2020 start date.\n3. the py2019 aco participant and snf affiliate change request review cycle has been updated to \n [7] track 1+. it is assumed that 2015 cehrt will be required to meet the base requirements of level e participation. if aco-11 is removed, as proposed, will the 2015 cehrt requirement for 2019 likewise be removed? it is unclear how the mssp proposed rule interacts with the 2019 pfs proposed rule. very few rural facilities currently utilize all 2015 cehrt. the cost to transition quickly is prohibitive. cms will need to develop a funding program to assist rural organizations with implementing 2015 cehrt if required to transition by 2019. the  proposed  change  to allow beneficiary opt-in completely misses the  mark.  requiring beneficiaries to decide to opt-in to an aco at the first primary care visit of each year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even with a template \u00e2\u0080\u0093 adds time to the visit that should be spent discussing the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wellbeing and health. it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a burden to the practices to add yet another disclaimer to review with patients. the proposed  rule fails  to  improve  the  beneficiary  notification process, nor  does  it  reduce administrative burden on practices. additionally, the mssp tried the opt-in approach before and removed the requirement in 2015 due to the increased burden it placed on practices. cms must remove this proposed change to the beneficiary assignment methodology.\n\n the  community  care  alliance  (cca)  is  a  rural  population  health  services  organization  that  manages accountable

behalf of the american academy of family physicians (aafp), which represents 131,400 family physicians and medical students across the country, i write in response to the proposed rule titled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success\u00e2\u0080\u009d published by the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) in the august, 17, 2018 federal register.\n the aafp welcomes and appreciates the continued opportunity to work with cms to identify and implement policies that improve the medicare program. we believe that the movement to value-based care and payment is critical to improving quality and outcomes for medicare beneficiaries, as well as to reduce costs for the program. this is especially critical given the 2018 medicare trustees report, which projects that the hospital insurance (hi) trust fund will be depleted in 2026\u00e2\u0080\u0094three years earlier than in the previous year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report.1 the aafp believes that a commitment and investment in physician-led models that support advanced primary care practices are necessary to strengthen the long-term solvency of the medicare program and to deliver patient-centered care to beneficiaries.\n our members offer a unique and important perspective as family physicians. they provide care in more than 90 percent of u.s. counties working in diverse settings as employed physicians, in large practices, and as owners of small independent practices. family physicians participate in the medicare shared savings program (mssp) accountable care organizations (acos)\u00e2\u0080\u0094 providing preventive and wellness services, chronic disease management, and leading care teams that also offer linkages to services that address the social determinants of health, which research has shown affect health outcomes. we are committed to working with cms to further develop and implement physician-led, primary care focused models that increase participation in value-based care and payment models.\n\n administrator verma page 2 of 25 october 15, 2018\n\n aafp member commitment to value-based care and payment the aafp has been committed to the transition away from fee-for-service (ffs) to value-based payment, which aligns with and supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shared goal of the delivery of high-quality, efficient, patient-centered care. our annual surveys indicate that among our members: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 41% are in patient-centered medical homes (pcmhs), \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 54% are in value-based payment models or contracts, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 38% of cpc+ participants are aafp members \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 of physicians in an aco (and knowledgeable of the type), more than half are in the medicare shared savings program (55%)\n the aafp has been working the past two years to develop the advanced primary care alternative payment model (apc-apm), a next generation, advanced primary care model that would empower family physicians\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially those in small, independent practices\u00e2\u0080\u0094to move away from ffs payment systems and in to population-based, predictable revenue streams that support comprehensive, longitudinal, and high-quality primary care. the aafp has appreciated cms and the innovation center\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engagement on moving this model forward.\n mssp aco program important apm opportunity for family physicians aco success is related to at least two factors\u00e2\u0080\u0094being physician-led and having a strong primary care foundation. a september 2018 new england journal of medicine article found that physician-led acos generated savings that increased over a three-year study period compared to hospital-led acos.2 in addition, a review by the patient-centered primary care collaborative (pcpcc) found that medicare acos with primary care physicians practicing in pcmh models were more likely to generate savings and demonstrated higher quality scores on a significant number of both process and outcome measures.3\n these findings show that cms should advance policies that encourage the formation of acos that are physician-led; can sustain participation across risk-bearing tracks; and support primary care transformation to generate greater savings for medicare and improve quality for beneficiaries.\n the aafp believes that the mssp aco program is an important opportunity for family physicians to participate in apms. the recommendations we offer are based on our members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experiences participating in acos and primary care transformation.\n\nii.a.3.b(2) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 levels of risk and reward in the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path \n summary cms proposes the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path will have an incremental approach to higher levels of risk and potential reward. the glide path has five levels. levels a and b, which do not have downside risk, and levels c-e, which have progressively higher levels of upside and downside risk. acos would be automatically advanced at the start of each participation year. the maximum allowed time in levels a-d would be one performance year. once acos reach level\n administrator verma page 3 of 25 october 15, 2018\n e, acos would be required to remain in that level for all subsequent years of participation in the basic track, which includes all years of a subsequent agreement period in the basic track.\n participation the basic track will depend on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience with the mssp.\n cms proposes that the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest level (level e) may be elected for any performance year by acos in the glide path but will be required no later than the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth performance year in the glide path.\n level a and level b: a final sharing rate not to exceed 25 percent based on quality performance would apply to the first dollar shared savings for acos that meet or exceed their minimum savings rate (msr). this is half of the maximum shared savings rate available under track 1. savings would be shared at this rate not to exceed 10 percent of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark.\n level c: a final sharing rate not to exceed 30 percent based on quality performance would apply to first dollar shared savings for acos that meet or exceed their msr, not to exceed 10 percent of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated historical benchmark.\n a loss sharing rate of 30 percent regardless of the quality performance would apply to the first dollar shared losses for acos with losses meeting or exceeding their minimum loss rate (mlr), not to exceed two percent of total medicare parts a and b revenue for aco participants. if the loss sharing limit as a percentage of total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue for aco participants exceeds the amount that is one percent of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark, then the loss sharing limit would be capped at one percent of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated historical benchmark for the applicable performance year.\n level d: a final sharing rate not to exceed 40 percent based on quality performance would apply to first dollar shared savings for acos that meet or exceed their msr, not to exceed 10 percent of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated historical benchmark.\n a loss sharing rate of 30 percent, regardless of the quality performance would apply to the first dollar shared losses for acos with losses meeting or exceeding their mlr, not to exceed four percent of total medicare parts a and b revenue for aco participants. if the loss sharing limit as a percentage of total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue for aco participants exceeds the amount that is two percent of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark, then the loss sharing limit would be capped at two percent of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated historical benchmark for the applicable performance year.\n level e: the levels of risk and potential reward would match the levels in track 1+. this level would qualify as an aapm. a final sharing rate not to exceed 50 percent based on quality performance would apply to first dollar shared savings for acos that meet or exceed their msr, not to exceed 10 percent of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated historical benchmark.\n administrator verma page 4 of 25 october 15, 2018\n aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated historical benchmark, then the loss sharing limit would be capped at one percent point higher than the expenditure-based nominal amount standard.\n aafp response the aafp supports the creation of more apms for practices of all sizes to participate. we firmly implore cms to increase the glide path for new, low-revenue acos in the one- sided levels of the basic track to three years. as cited above, we believe this is supported by a recent study published by the new england journal of medicine, which found that, after three years in the mssp, physician-led acos were able to generate shared savings that grew over the study period.4 it is imperative to allow acos, particularly physician-led and low-revenue acos, enough time to generate sufficient shared savings to offset startup costs and support sustained transformation.\n we strongly encourage cms to maintain the current shared savings rate at 50 percent for basic levels a-d. cms must offer a higher shared savings rate to support acos\u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially physician-led and low-revenue acos with more limited capital reserves\u00e2\u0080\u0094in their efforts to improve quality and decrease costs. in addition, the msr ensures acos in one-sided only tracks are not earning shared savings due to chance. we believe that the proposed shared savings rates for levels a-d are not adequate to support or incentivize participation and ask that cms consider maintaining current shared savings and msr levels.\n\nii.a.3.b(3) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 calculation of loss sharing limit \n summary cms is proposing an approach where the loss-sharing limit for basic track acos would be determined as a percentage of aco participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue that is capped at a percentage of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated historical benchmark expenditures when the amount that is a certain percentage of aco participant ffs revenue (depending on track) exceeds the specified percentage of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated historical benchmark expenditures for the relevant risk/reward level. cms expects this approach would tend to place acos that include hospitals under a benchmark-based loss-sharing limit.\n cms is proposing to establish the revenue-based loss sharing limit as the default for acos in the basic track and to phase-in the percentage of aco participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue. however, if the amount that is the applicable percentage of aco participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue exceeds the amount that is the applicable percentage of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark, then the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loss sharing limit would be capped and set at this percentage of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated historical benchmark.\n for the basic track, cms proposes that the percentage of aco participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ffs revenue to determine the revenue-based loss sharing limit for level e would be set for each performance year consistent with the generally applicable nominal amount standard for an aapm.\n aafp response the aafp supports the cms proposal to use a revenue-based approach to calculate aco loss sharing rates. the aafp also supports the proposal to cap and set the loss sharing rate at the percentage of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated historical benchmark expenditures, if the revenue-based amount exceeds the applicable percentage of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark.\n\n administrator verma page 5 of 25 october 15, 2018\n the aafp supports the cms proposal to set the revenue-based loss sharing limit for the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level e consistent with the generally applicable nominal amount standard required for aapms. the aafp suggests cms maintain the eight percent generally applicable nominal amount standard at least through the qp performance period 2024. we believe this will support the ability of low-revenue acos to bear risk; whereas risk based on benchmarks is challenging for low-revenue acos operating on thin margins. to enable participation and set acos up for success, cms should rely on a revenue-based risk structure. any expenditure-based nominal risk amount should be kept low to avoid placing physician-led and low revenue acos at a disadvantage. we ask cms to maintain the three percent expenditure-based nominal amount standard through at least qp performance period 2024. this should provide program stability in both the quality payment program and the medicare shared savings program, while also allowing cms to gain a better understanding of how the risk levels will affect low-revenue acos.\n\nii.a.4.c \u00e2\u0080\u0093 proposals for permitting annual election of beneficiary assignment methodology \n summary cms is proposing to offer acos entering the basic or enhanced tracks, beginning july 1, 2019, and in subsequent years, the option to choose either prospective assignment or preliminary assignment with retrospective reconciliation, prior to the start of their agreement period. they also propose to provide an opportunity for acos to switch their selection of beneficiary assignment methodology on an annual basis. an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficiary assignment methodology would have no effect on the voluntary alignment process.\n aafp response the aafp supports the cms proposal to allow acos to choose either prospective assignment or preliminary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. we also support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow acos to update their beneficiary assignment methodology on an annual basis. as we discuss elsewhere, we ask cms to delay implementation of the basic and enhanced tracks and any applicable policies until january 1, 2020.\n\nii.a.5.b(1) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 identifying low-revenue acos and high-revenue acos \n summary cms proposes that if an aco participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue exceeds a specified threshold of total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries, the aco would be considered high revenue. acos with a percentage less than the threshold amount would be considered low revenue.\n the proposed approach generally would categorize acos that include hospitals, health systems, or other providers and suppliers that furnish part a services as aco participants or aco providers/suppliers as high revenue. acos with participants and providers/suppliers that mostly furnish part b services would generally be categorized as low revenue. cms proposes a threshold of 25 percent to determine low revenue versus high revenue. cms will make revenue and expenditure calculations using the most recent calendar year for which 12 months of data are available.\n cms considered a lower threshold of 15 or 20 percent, and a higher threshold of 30 percent. cms also considered an alternative that would use multiple years of revenue and expenditure data.\n\n\n administrator verma page 6 of 25 october 15, 2018\n aafp response the aafp is supportive of the cms definition of high-revenue and low-revenue acos. we believe it is appropriate to generally define low-revenue acos as those whose providers and suppliers mostly provide part b services, which are likely to be physician-led acos. as previously noted, physician-led acos have consistently shown their ability to produce savings. the aafp supports and appreciates the additional flexibilities included throughout this proposed rule for low-revenue acos and we urge cms to finalize these provisions. we also ask cms to allow new low-revenue acos to remain in the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s levels a and b for three years before being required to assume downside risk given their more limited capital reserves compared to high-revenue, hospital-led acos.\n\nii.a.5.b(2) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 restricting acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 participation in the basic track prior to transitioning to \n participation in the enhanced track summary cms proposes to limit high-revenue acos to, at most, a single agreement period under the basic track prior to transitioning to the enhanced track. cms proposes to limit low-revenue acos to, at most, two agreement periods under the basic track. the agreements would not be required to be sequential, which would allow low-revenue acos to transition to the enhanced track after a single agreement period under the basic track, and the opportunity to return to the basic track if the enhanced track initially proves too high of risk. once an aco has participated under the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path, a subsequent agreement period under the basic track would be required at level e.\n cms considered and seeks comment on an approach that would allow low-revenue acos to gradually transition from the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level e up to the full levels of risk and potential reward of the enhanced track. for example, cms seeks comment on whether it would be helpful to devise a glide path that would be available to low-revenue acos entering the enhanced track. cms also considered and seeks comment on whether such a glide path under the enhanced track should be available to all acos.\n aafp response the aafp is concerned about the steep increase in risk between the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level e and the enhanced track. we support the ability of low-revenue acos to stay in the basic track for two agreement periods. we encourage cms to continue to assess the ability of low-revenue acos to assume higher levels of downside risk. cms should also evaluate the success rates of low-revenue acos that moved to the enhanced track and monitor the number of acos that returned to the basic track, particularly due to inability to assume higher levels of risk.\n\nii.a.5.b(3) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 allowing greater potential for reward for low-revenue acos \n summary cms is seeking comment, but not making specific proposals, on approaches to allow for greater access to shared savings for low-revenue acos.\n cms considered an approach that would allow for low-revenue acos to have a lower msr in the one-sided levels of the basic track. cms considered a fixed one percent, fixed two percent, or zero percent msr. they would apply a variable msr based on the number of assigned beneficiaries in the event the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries falls below 5,000 for the performance year.\n administrator verma page 7 of 25 october 15, 2018\n percent sharing rate based on quality performance for all levels within the basic track for low revenue acos.\n aafp response the aafp supports a msr of one percent for acos in one-sided levels of the basic track. we also support a higher final sharing rate of 50 percent for low-revenue acos in the first four levels (a-d) of the basic track. while one-sided models (levels a-b) do not carry downside financial risk, they are not without risk. the startup investments for acos are substantial and should be considered a significant financial risk in themselves. to succeed, practices must make organizational and operational changes as they work to improve quality and reduce cost, with no guaranteed return on investment. acos and practices typically do not receive their shared savings until 18-24 months after the performance year, making their commitment even riskier.\n acos generate more shared savings the longer they are in the program. by combining a lower msr and higher final shared savings rate, acos should be able to continue to invest in new and innovative ways to improve their performance. as existing and new acos progress through the basic track, cms needs to ensure there are sufficient and attainable incentives to support the transformation efforts required to improve quality and lower cost. a lower msr and higher sharing rate will provide predictability of savings and the financial support acos need to ensure successful participation.\n\nii.a.5.c(5) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 proposed evaluation criteria for determining participation options \n summary cms proposes to identify available participation options for acos by considering: (1) whether the aco is a low-revenue aco or a high-revenue aco; and (2) the level of risk with which the aco or its aco participants has experienced based on participation in the medicare aco initiatives in recent years.\n cms proposes to define a \u00e2\u0080\u009cperformance-based risk medicare aco initiative\u00e2\u0080\u009d to include mssp tracks 2 and 3, the enhanced track, and the proposed basic track (including levels a through e). it will also include the: pioneer aco model, next generation aco model, the performance-based risk tracks of the comprehensive end stage renal disease care (cec) model, track 1+, and other models that may be specified by cms.\n to determine if an aco qualifies as \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced with performance-based risk medicare aco initiatives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d there are two requirements that must be met: (1) the aco is a legal entity that has not participated in any performance-based risk medicare aco, as defined under \u00e2\u00a7425.20, and has not deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under track 1 or 2; and (2) less than 40 percent of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, as defined under \u00e2\u00a7425.20, or in an aco that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement under track 2 or 3 in each of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n cms will determine cumulatively what percentage of aco participants were in any performance-based risk medicare aco initiative in each of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n\n administrator verma page 8 of 25 october 15, 2018\n cms proposes to define an aco as \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced with performance-based risk medicare aco initiatives\u00e2\u0080\u009d if it meets either of the following criteria: (1) the aco is the same legal entity as a current or previous aco that is participating in, or has participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, as defined under \u00e2\u00a7425.20, or that has deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under track 2 or 3; or (2) forty percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, as defined under \u00e2\u00a7425.20, or in an aco that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under track 2 or 3 in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n all track 1 acos that deferred their renewal will be considered experienced with performance- based risk medicare aco initiatives.\n cms considered an alternative that would restrict acos with track 1 experience from participating in any of the one-sided models of the basic track (level a and b).\n aafp response the aafp supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to define participation options based on prior experience with performance-based risk. offering acos with previous track 1 experience an additional year in a one-sided model before transitioning to downside risk is appropriate.\n however, we ask cms to raise the final sharing rate for low revenue acos in the levels a-d of the basic track to at least 50 percent. without an increase, acos with previous track 1 experience that enter the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s levels b-d will experience a significant decrease in their sharing rate that will not increase to the current track 1 level for three years. such a decrease could disadvantage acos with track 1 experience that have made operational and infrastructure investments based on the current structure of the program. we are concerned that not only could this reduce participation in the program, but it could also jeopardize aco ability to support the initiatives that drive improved quality and decreased cost. one of the goals of the medicare access and chip reauthorization act (macra) legislation was to transition physicians from ffs to alternative payment models. in the absence of sufficient incentives, practice that can perform well in the merit-based incentive payment system (mips) will not have reason to transition to an apm. since the program does not offer adequate rewards, the program could drive practices back to ffs.\n\nii.a.5.d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 monitoring for financial performance \n summary cms is proposing to add a provision to allow them to monitor an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial performance. specifically, cms will monitor for whether the expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning the expenditures for the assigned beneficiaries exceed the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark by an amount equal to or exceeding either the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative msr under a one-sided model, or the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mlr under a two-sided model. cms proposes that they may take any of the pre-termination actions specified in \u00e2\u00a7425.216 if the aco is \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a performance year. if the aco is \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d for another performance year, cms may immediately or with advance notice terminate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement.\n administrator verma page 9 of 25 october 15, 2018\n cms seeks comment on this issue, and on acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use of reinsurance, including their ability to obtain viable reinsurance products covering a medicare ffs population.\n aafp response since the proposed design of the program transitions all acos to assume downside risk, the aafp believes this will automatically mitigate the risk of acos with poor performance from continuing participation in the program. therefore, we do not feel it is necessary for cms to terminate acos that are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d after two years.\n as we discuss in other sections of this letter, we ask cms to allow new, low-revenue acos to participate without downside risk for three years. analyses have shown that savings increase as acos become more familiar with the program. new acos need time to adjust to the program requirements. removing new acos that are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d after two years is punitive. cms should assess an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance for the entire agreement period before considering any termination action. in addition, we believe acos that are underperforming will voluntarily terminate as they are required to assume downside risk under the new glide path in the proposed rule.\n\nii.a.6.c(4) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 proposal for repayment mechanism duration \n summary cms is proposing revisions to \u00e2\u00a7425.204(f)(6). cms proposes to specify that a repayment mechanism must be in effect for the duration of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation in a two-sided model, plus 24 months after the conclusion of the agreement period. cms proposes three exceptions to this rule.\n cms recognizes that it might be difficult for renewing acos that are completing the term of their current agreement period to extend an existing repayment mechanism for seven years (full five- year agreement period, plus the 24-month tail period). cms is considering whether they should allow the existing payment mechanism to be extended long enough to cover the first two or three performance year of the new agreement period. this would equate to four or five years (two or three years, plus the 24-month tail period). cms seeks comment on whether they should require a shorter or longer extension.\n cms notes that the repayment mechanism may terminate earlier than 24 months after the agreement period if it is no longer needed. cms proposes that a repayment mechanism may be terminated at the earliest of the following conditions: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the aco has fully repaid any shared losses owed for each performance year of the agreement period under a two-sided model; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms has exhausted the amount reserved by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repayment mechanism and the arrangement does not need to be maintained to support the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation in the mssp; or \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms determines the aco does not owe any shared losses under the mssp for any of the performance years of the agreement period.\n cms seeks comment on whether these proposed provisions at \u00e2\u00a7425.204(f)(6) are adequate to protect the financial integrity of the mssp, to provide greater certainty to acos and financial institutions, and to facilitate the establishment of repayment mechanism arrangements.\n administrator verma page 10 of 25 october 15, 2018\n repay any shared losses, as repayments are due within 90 days of notification. a 24-month tail period would place an undue burden on small- and low-revenue acos that operate on thin margins.\n\nii.a.6.c(5) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 proposals for regarding institutions issuing repayment mechanism arrangements \n summary cms is proposing to revise its policy to specify that an aco may demonstrate its ability to repay shared losses by placing funds in escrow with an insured institution, obtaining a surety bond from a company included on the u.s. department of treasury\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list of certified companies, or establishing a line of credit (as evidenced by a letter of credit that the medicare program can draw upon) at an insured institution. cms will update the repayment mechanism arrangements guidance to specify the types of institutions that would meet these requirements.\n aafp response the aafp supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed issuing institutions for repayment mechanisms. small and rural acos may be more likely to select surety bonds. we appreciate any policies that alleviate burden and reduce barriers to participation for small and rural acos.\n\nii.a.6.d(3) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 proposals for payment consequences of termination \n summary cms is concerned that the updates to the required termination notification period could allow for gaming. an aco facing losses could wait until the end of the year to terminate and would not be liable for any losses. cms is proposing to conduct a financial reconciliation for all acos in two- sided models that voluntarily terminate after june 30. cms will use the full 12 months of performance year expenditure data in performing the reconciliation. for acos that generate losses, cms will prorate the shared loss amount by the number of months during the year in which the aco was in the program. cms considered whether to allow acos to voluntarily terminate after june 30 to share in portion of any shared savings. however, they decided to limit the proposal to shared losses.\n cms is also proposing to prorate any shared losses for acos in two-sided models that are involuntarily terminated by cms.\n aafp response the aafp is supportive of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to prorate shared losses for acos that voluntarily terminate or are terminated by cms after june 30. we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed methodology to prorate shared losses. we support allowing acos that terminate early to continue to share in savings provided they meet the criteria in \u00e2\u00a7425.221.\n\nii.a.7.a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 participation options for agreement periods beginning in 2019 (overview) \n summary cms is proposing to offer a july 1, 2019 start date as the initial opportunity for acos to enter an agreement period under the basic track or the enhanced track. cms anticipates the application cycle would begin in early 2019. aside from the acos that entered initial agreements beginning in 2015 and deferred renewal into a second agreement period, cms will not be accepting applications from other acos for a new agreement period beginning on january 1, 2019. the july 1, 2019, start date is a one-time opportunity and cms expects to offer a 2019 application cycle for a january 1, 2020, start date for new five-year participation agreements.\n administrator verma page 11 of 25 october 15, 2018\n based on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreement period start date, an aco would have the following options for a july 1, 2019, start date: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 acos entering an agreement period beginning on july 1, 2019, would have an agreement period of five years and six months, of which the first performance year would be july 1, 2019, through december 31, 2019. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 acos that entered a first or second agreement period that started in 2016 may elect to extend their agreement period for an optional fourth performance period (january 1, 2019, through june 30, 2019). this option is voluntary\u00e2\u0080\u0094an aco that does not choose to extend their agreement period would conclude its participation in the program with the expiration of its current agreement (december 31, 2018).\n cms also considered forgoing an application cycle for a 2019 start date entirely. under this alternative, acos would enter agreement periods for the basic or enhanced track for the first time beginning january 1, 2020. cms would allow acos that started a first or second agreement period on january 1, 2016, to elect a 12-month extension of their current agreement period to cover the duration of calendar year 2019.\n aafp response the aafp strongly encourages cms to delay the implementation of all proposed policies until january 1, 2020. we ask that cms extend the existing agreements for calendar year 2019 and begin agreement periods under the basic or enhanced track no earlier than january 1, 2020. the proposed changes are complex. as the final rule will likely not be released until early 2019, practices will need sufficient time to assess the changes and make participation decisions. cms and medical societies, such as the aafp, will need time to disseminate information to physicians. with a proposed july 1, 2019, start date, cms is creating two six-month performance years, which adds an additional layer of complexity and confusion. delaying the start until 2020 will give new acos adequate time to form and review the participation criteria. we add that the significant proposed changes will also require an adjustment period for cms staff. a later implementation will give cms additional time to ensure a smooth and effective transition. moreover, we encourage and are hopeful cms will implement new apms for small practices by 2020 to provide equal apm opportunities for all practice sizes.\n\nii.b.2.b \u00e2\u0080\u0093 billing and payment for telehealth services \n summary to comply with the bipartisan budget act (bba) of 2018, cms is proposing to treat a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home as an originating site and not to apply the originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services furnished by a physician or practitioner participating in an applicable aco. cms proposes to apply these policies to acos under a two-sided model that participate under the prospective assignment method.\n cms proposes that these policies would go into effect beginning with performance year 2020 and subsequent years for physicians or practitioners participating in acos that are operating under a two-sided model with a prospective assignment methodology for the applicable performance year. participants of aco track 1+ would be able to furnish and be paid for telehealth services in accordance with section 1899(1) of the act.\n administrator verma page 12 of 25 october 15, 2018\n\n cms proposes that aco participants must not submit claims for services specified as inpatient only when the service is furnished as a telehealth services and the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home is the originating site. example codes include cpt codes: g0406, g0407, g0408, g0425, g0426, and g0427.\n to provide protection to a beneficiary when they are prospectively assigned to an aco, but subsequently excluded from assignment, cms is proposing to provide a 90-day grace period for payment of otherwise covered telehealth services to allow sufficient time for cms to notify an applicable aco of any beneficiary exclusions, and for the aco to then inform its participants and providers/suppliers of those exclusions. cms would make payments for telehealth services provided to such a beneficiary as if they were telehealth services authorized under section 1899(1) if the following conditions are met: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the beneficiary was prospectively assigned to an applicable aco at the beginning of the relevant performance year, but was excluded in the most recent quarterly update \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the telehealth services are furnished to the beneficiary by a physician or practitioner billing through the tin of an aco participant in an applicable aco within 90 days following the date that cms delivers the quarterly exclusion list to the applicable aco. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 except for the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exclusion from the applicable aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assignment list, cms would have made payment to the aco for such services under section 1899(1).\n in the event that cms makes no payment for telehealth services and the only reason the claim was non-covered is because the beneficiary was not prospectively assigned to the aco or was not in the 90-day grace period, the following beneficiary protections would apply: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the aco participant must not charge the beneficiary for the expenses incurred for such services; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the aco participant must return to the beneficiary any monies collected for such service; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the aco may be subject to compliance actions, including being required to submit a correction action plan (cap) under \u00e2\u00a7425.216(b) for cms approval.\n cms welcomes comments on these proposals for implementing the requirements of section 1899(1), as added by the bipartisan budget act, and related issues.\n aafp response the aafp supports the proposal to allow a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home to be an originating site, and believe all originating site restrictions should be removed to reduce regulatory burden and to facilitate patient-centered care. patients should be able to receive care wherever they are located, such as a work or vacation site. we also support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal not to include a facility fee.\n however, we have concerns regarding the administrative burden of determining beneficiary eligibility for telehealth services and ask cms to transition to a real-time benefit eligibility confirmation system for physician offices.\n\nii.c.2.c \u00e2\u0080\u0093 proposals for beneficiary incentive programs \n summary to comply with sections 1899(b)(2) and (m) of the bipartisan budget act, cms is proposing to allow acos participating under certain two-sided models to establish incentive programs to provide incentive payments to assigned beneficiaries who receive qualifying services.\n administrator verma page 13 of 25 october 15, 2018\n beneficiaries would be eligible to receive an incentive payment if they are prospectively or assigned through the preliminary prospective methodology. beneficiaries that voluntarily align with an aco are considered prospectively assigned. therefore, any beneficiary assigned to an aco participating under track 2; levels c, d, or e of the basic track; or the enanced track may receive an incentive payment.\n cms proposes to mirror language from the section 1899(m)(2)(c) so that \u00e2\u0080\u009ca qualifying service is a primary care service\u00e2\u0080\u009d as defined in \u00e2\u00a7425.20 \u00e2\u0080\u009cto which coinsurance applies under part b,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and is furnished through an aco by \u00e2\u0080\u009can aco professional who has a primary care specialty designation included in the definition of primary care physician\u00e2\u0080\u009d under \u00e2\u00a7425.20; or a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, federally qualified health center (fqhc), or rural health clinic (rhc).\n cms proposes to limit the incentive payment maximum of $20. the incentive amount must be the same for all eligible medicare ffs beneficiaries, regardless of the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enrollment in a medicare supplemental policy, state medicaid plan, or a waiver of such a plan, or in any other health insurance policy or health plan. the incentive payment may be made in different forms\n(e.g., gift card, check) depending on the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preference. acos would be prohibited \n from distributing incentive payments in the form of cash and must be made in the form a cash equivalent, which includes instruments convertible to cash or widely accepted on the same bases as cash, such as checks and debit cards.\n the aco must furnish an incentive payment to an eligible beneficiary each time the beneficiary receives a qualifying service. the incentive payment must be made no later than 30 days following a qualifying service.\n cms is proposing that the aco legal entity, and not the aco participants or aco providers/suppliers, furnish the incentive payments directly to beneficiaries. cms seeks comment on other potential methods for distributing an incentive payment.\n cms proposes that an aco would be required to fully fund the costs associated with an incentive program. the aco would be prohibited from accepting or using funds furnished by an outside entity, including, but not limited to, an insurance company, pharmaceutical company, or any other entity outside of the aco, to finance its beneficiary incentive program.\n cms also proposes that the secretary will not make separate payments to an aco for a beneficiary incentive program. however, the aco is not prohibited from using shared savings to fund its program. cms proposes that the policy regarding the use of shared savings would apply to both in-kind items and services, as well as incentive payments. cms proposes to prohibit acos from shifting the cost of establishing or operating an incentive program to a federal health care program, as defined at section 1128b(f).\n aafp response there are opportunities for several waivers that would both help mssp acos improve care delivery and encourage beneficiary health-seeking behavior. our strongest recommendation is waiving certain primary care co-pays for all aco tracks. we offer this proposal for four reasons.\n administrator verma page 14 of 25 october 15, 2018\n provided, chronic conditions are kept from unduly progressing, and new conditions or exacerbations of existing conditions are prevented.\n second, unstable beneficiary assignment is a well-recognized mssp problem. in one study, unstable assignment was as high as 33 percent and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmuch of the outpatient specialty care for patients assigned to acos, particularly higher-cost patients with more office visits and chronic conditions, was provided by specialists outside of patients' assigned organizations, even among more specialty-oriented acos.\u00e2\u0080\u009d we believe a co-pay waiver would reduce unstable assignment and \u00e2\u0080\u009cleakage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where aco-assigned patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 office visits occur outside their aco.\n third, because we propose to limit the co-pay waiver to five specific primary care evaluation and management (e/m) codes (99211-99215) and the chronic care management (ccm) code (cpt code 99490), we believe this will produce the greatest benefit for the least cost to the aco. without an out-of-pocket (oop) cost, the aco patient can seek care without having to decide presumptively whether care is essential or not. for the aco provider, the waiver will help reduce year-over-year assignment instability and leakage. the co-pay waiver would also serve the aco provider and patient equally well since more timely appointments and greater adherence to care would minimize the possibility of greater downstream costs due to higher intensity care. the waiver would both motivate and reinforce beneficiary-provider attestation. voluntary alignment of a patient with his/her primary care provider is recognized by cms as inherent in improving the goal of patient-centered care.\n fourth, we recognize the concern that waiving oop costs can drive over or unnecessary utilization (i.e., the concern over the \u00e2\u0080\u009coffset effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d). here again we are limiting the waiver to a discrete number of primary care codes delivered by primary care physicians. the waiver would also only benefit a discrete number of aco patients since about 25 percent of medicare beneficiaries have medigap insurance and a much larger percentage have supplemental coverage via employer-sponsored plans and other polices that typically provide first dollar coverage. we also know beneficiaries without secondary coverage have poorer health, lower incomes, higher out-of-pocket costs, and, as a result, underutilize medically-necessary care.\n in sum, we believe waiving a discrete list of primary care service co-pays for all three aco tracks would encourage the use of primary care services, improve patient outcomes over time, and further enhance patient-centered care. this recommendation is consistent with the medicare payment advisory commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (medpac\u00e2\u0080\u0099s) 2010 technical panel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finding that lowering cost sharing services for preventive services is an effective way to encourage the use of high-value, high-quality health care.\n\nii.c.3.a(2) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 proposed revisions (beneficiary notification) \n summary to comply with the bba, cms is proposing, beginning july 1, 2019, that an aco participant must notify beneficiaries at the point of care about voluntary alignment, in addition to notifying beneficiaries that its aco providers/suppliers are participating in the mssp and the beneficiary has the opportunity to decline claims data sharing. the notification must include the process by which a beneficiary can identify or change identification of a primary care provider for purposes of voluntary alignment.\n administrator verma page 15 of 25 october 15, 2018\n\n cms proposes that acos must use a template prepared by cms. the template would include details about how a beneficiary may select his or her primary care provider on medicare.gov, and the step-by-step process by which a beneficiary could designate an aco professional as his/her primary care provider, and how a beneficiary could change such designation.\n aafp response the aafp adamantly believes that proactive beneficiary notification of participation in an apm is critical to engaging patients in their care. cms must maintain current aco requirements for beneficiary notification. we are concerned the cms proposal adds undue burden on aco participants. cms goals are already satisfied through the existing requirements for aco participants to post signs in its facilities. patients are already inundated with information at their visits, including reviewing and signing privacy agreements, verifying or updating addresses and insurance information, etc. any new requirements will increase burden for staff and could overwhelm patients. as an alternative, we suggest cms include information on voluntary alignment as part of its \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedicare and you\u00e2\u0080\u009d educational materials.\n should cms move forward with this, we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to provide templates that contain all required information. the template should be made available to aco participants immediately upon entering the program. to ensure the information is relevant and easily understood, cms should include stakeholders and beneficiaries in the development of the template. any additional information (such as aco quality reporting, financial incentives, etc.) can be added by aco participants as they see appropriate. while there can be multiple methods for sharing the information, the format of dissemination should be left up to the aco participants. if required, there should not be restrictions on when the information is provided to beneficiaries, so long as its provided annually. for example, an aco participant could send an email notice to its beneficiaries at the beginning of the year.\n\nii.c.3.b \u00e2\u0080\u0093 beneficiary opt-in based assignment methodology \n summary cms is exploring ways to implement a beneficiary opt-in based assignment methodology. opt-in differs from voluntary alignment. voluntary alignment is based on the relationship between the beneficiary and a single practitioner in the aco. an opt in based on assignment methodology would be an affirmative recognition of the relationship between the beneficiary and the aco itself.\n cms believes an opt-in methodology would be similar to enrollment in a medicare advantage (ma) plan.\n cms would need to determine how frequently beneficiaries would be able to opt in or withdraw an opt in to an aco, and whether there should be limits on the ability to change an opt in after the end of the opt-in window, in order to reduce possible beneficiary assignment \u00e2\u0080\u009cchurn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos would be responsible for providing the list of beneficiaries who have opted in to assignment, along with each beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medicare number, address, and certain other demographic information. acos may need to acquire new information technology and additional support staff to track, monitor, and transmit opt-in data to cms. cms believes it would be critical for acos to inform beneficiaries of their option to withdraw their opt in to the aco.\n\n\n administrator verma page 16 of 25 october 15, 2018\n acos would still be required to have at least 5,000 ffs beneficiaries assigned to the aco at the time of application and for the entirety of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreement period.\n cms could allow beneficiaries to opt in before they have received a primary care service from a physician in the aco, or any service from an aco provider/supplier. this means a beneficiary could be assigned to an aco based on opting in to the aco, and the aco would be accountable for total cost and quality of care for the beneficiary, including care from providers that are not in the aco. to comply with section 1899(c), cms is considering whether they would need to continue to require that a beneficiary receive at least one primary care service from an aco professional in the aco who is a primary care physician or a physician with a specialty used in assignment for the beneficiary to be eligible to opt in to assignment to the\naco.  \n\n cms would allow, but not require, acos to elect an opt-in methodology. when entering or renewing its participation in the mssp, an aco could elect an opt in based on assignment methodology that would apply for the length of the agreement period.\n an aco that does not elect an opt-in methodology would continue to be assigned beneficiaries using the existing methodology. cms is considering discontinuing the existing methodologies and applying an opt-in methodology program wide as a hybrid assignment approach, which includes a beneficiary opt in, modified claims-based assignment, and voluntary alignment.\n hybrid assignment would be used for acos that elect to participate under an opt in methodology. beneficiaries who opt in to assignment or who voluntarily align with the aco would be prospectively assigned. if a beneficiary was not prospectively assigned using either of these two methods, the beneficiary would be assigned to such aco only if the beneficiary received the plurality of their primary care services from the aco and received at least seven primary care services from one or more aco professionals in the aco during the applicable assignment window. beneficiaries that did not receive at least seven primary care services would not be assigned to the aco based on claims\u00e2\u0080\u0094even if they received the plurality of their primary care services from the aco. cms seeks comment on whether to use a higher- or lower-minimum threshold for determining beneficiaries assigned to the aco under a modified claims-based assignment approach.\n cms does not anticipate that it would establish restrictions on the geographic locations of the acos from which a beneficiary could select.\n cms anticipates that beneficiaries who opt in would likely be a subset of beneficiaries who would have been assigned under the existing claims-based methodology. based on cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experience, 75 percent of aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries receive six or fewer primary care service visits annually.\n administrator verma page 17 of 25 october 15, 2018\n in policy because, based on their experience with the pioneer aco model, beneficiaries are less likely to identify with an aco than with an individual physician. we agree. beneficiaries should be encouraged to align and develop a relationship with a primary care physician. the relationship between a patient and the primary care physician is vital, will drive better patient outcomes, and lower costs. primary care helps prevent illness and death, and it is associated with a more equitable distribution of health in populations.5 primary care is also associated with enhanced access to health care services and better health outcomes, as well as lower costs through changes in utilization, such as lower rates of hospitalization and emergency department visits.6\n cms explains that an opt-in approach could create a stronger economic incentive for acos to compete against other acos and non-aco providers. we are not clear how an opt-in approach encourages this any more than a voluntary alignment approach. in either instance, for the purposes of improving quality and managing cost, the beneficiary is aligned with the aco.\n cms is proposing to allow beneficiaries to align with an aco even if they have not received any services from a physician within the aco. in previous rulemaking, when discussing voluntary alignment policies, cms stated it would not be fair to hold an aco accountable for the quality and costs of a beneficiary with whom they do not have a relationship. to prevent this, cms decided beneficiaries must have received at least one primary care service to be assigned to an aco through voluntary alignment. allowing beneficiaries to align with an aco even if they do not have a relationship with any provider within the aco is inconsistent. under any opt-in or voluntary alignment policy, a beneficiary should only be assigned to the aco if he or she has received at least one primary care service from a physician within the aco.\n cms is proposing to allow acos to elect an opt-in approach. for these acos, beneficiaries may be assigned to the aco based on opt-in, voluntarily alignment, or claims-based assignment. as part of this proposal, cms would only assign a beneficiary to an aco using claims if the beneficiary received the plurality of his or her primary care services from the aco and received at least seven primary care services from one or more aco professionals in the\naco. cms states that about 75 percent of beneficiaries receive six or fewer primary care \n service visits annually. such policies may prevent many acos from reaching the 5,000- beneficiary threshold and create barriers to participation. further, cms is creating unnecessary complexities by introducing multiple claims-based attribution methodologies. claims-based attribution should remain based upon plurality of primary care services.\n patient attribution methodology is critical to payment, quality, and cost performance measurement, and defining accountability. physicians are assured they know for whom they are accountable in terms of quality and cost. accurate attribution may also help patients understand the importance of their relationship with their primary care physician, and the need to include the physician in major and minor decisions that impact their health, such as when and how to seek medical care or lifestyle choices.\n in 2016, the health care payment learning and action network (hcplan) released a white paper on patient attribution, in which they deemed patient attestation as the gold standard for attribution for population-based payments that rely on primary care as the starting point to\n administrator verma page 18 of 25 october 15, 2018\n coordinate care across the continuum. some private payers already use self-attestation in patient attribution.\n in our advanced primary care alternative payment model (apc-apm) proposal to the physician focused payment model technical advisory committee (ptac), the aafp recommended an attribution methodology that uses beneficiary alignment and prospective patient attribution. we offer it as an alternative to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed policies.\n the aafp recommends a patient-based, prospective, four-step process that includes a 24- month look-back period for attribution. patients attributed through this process should be the focus of payment and performance measurement. a prospective methodology allows physicians to know for whom they are responsible in advance and facilitates proactive care planning and management. like the cpc+ initiative, patients should be attributed on a quarterly basis. for attribution purposes, a primary care physician should be defined as a physician who is in a family medicine, general internal medicine, geriatric medicine, general pediatrics, or general practice specialty.\n the four-step attribution process\n1. patient selection of primary care physician and team  \n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 this is the acknowledgement that patient selection is the best choice in attribution and should be prioritized as such. while the patient is attributed to a specific physician, their attribution within the model will be to the aco.\n\n2. primary care visit events: wellness visits \n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 if a patient is not attributed by self-selection of a primary care physician, medicare should use well visits, including welcome to medicare (ippe), physicals, and annual wellness visits (awv) provided by the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary care physician or the practice team, as the next step in the attribution process.\n\n3. primary care visit events: all other e/m visits \n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 if a patient is not attributed by a wellness visit, the next incremental step is to include all other evaluation and management (e/m) visits to a primary care physician. medicare should attribute the patient to the primary care physician who provides the plurality of e/m visits.\n\n4. primary care prescription and order events  \n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 if the patient is not attributed by a wellness visits or any other e/m services, medicare should consider claims related to medication prescriptions, durable medical equipment prescriptions, and lab and other referral orders made by primary care physicians. medicare should require a minimum of three such events before attributing a patient on this basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n administrator verma page 19 of 25 october 15, 2018\n\n\n\n review and reconciliation of attributed patients no patient attribution methodology is perfect. the four-step methodology recommended above may still produce errors in assignment. physicians should have the option to engage in a reconciliation process in which they can review and recommend the addition and removal of patients (with supporting rationale) from the formal list medicare supplies to them. like the attribution process, review and reconciliation should occur quarterly and include enough time to adequately review the list.\n\nii.e.2.b \u00e2\u0080\u0093 proposals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 revisions to policies on voluntary alignment \n summary section 1899(c), as amended by section 50331 of the bipartisan budget act of 2018, requires the secretary to permit medicare ffs beneficiaries to voluntarily identify an aco professional as their primary care provider for purposes of assignment to an aco.\n cms is proposing to modify their current policies, such that cms will assign a beneficiary to an aco based upon their selection of any aco professional, regardless of specialty, as their primary clinician. if the beneficiary selects any provider or supplier outside of the aco, the beneficiary will not be added to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list of assigned beneficiaries for a performance year.\n administrator verma page 20 of 25 october 15, 2018\n\n if a beneficiary does not change their primary care clinician designation, they will remain assigned to the aco in which that practitioner participates during the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire agreement period and any subsequent agreement periods under the mssp, even if the beneficiary no longer seeks care from any aco professionals.\n cms proposes that acos must use a cms-developed template notice that encourages beneficiaries to check their designation regularly and update it when they change providers or move.\n aafp response the aafp strongly opposes cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to remove the requirement that a beneficiary must have received at least one primary care service from an aco professional who is either a primary care physician or a physician with a specialty designation to be assigned to the aco. cms cites the bipartisan budget act of 2018 as reasons for removing this requirement. however, we believe the bba only specifies that beneficiaries must be notified of their ability and informed of the process to make a voluntary alignment, and any voluntary alignment supersedes any claims-based assignment. we believe requiring a beneficiary to have at least one primary care service to be eligible for assignment to the aco through voluntary alignment still complies with the bba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requirements and that such a requirement does not supersede a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voluntary alignment.\n we disagree with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rationale that their approach \u00e2\u0080\u009creduces burden on beneficiaries and their practitioners by not requiring practitioners to provide unnecessary care\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d as this implies as little as one primary care service a year is unnecessary. this sends an incorrect and inappropriate message to both beneficiaries and physicians.\n we are supportive of voluntary alignment and believe it is heading in the right direction in terms of attribution. we offer cms an alternative approach that incorporates beneficiary attribution as the primary form of attribution. as detailed in the previous section, the aafp recommends a patient-based, prospective, four-step process that includes a 24-month look-back period for attribution\n\nii.e.3.b \u00e2\u0080\u0093 proposals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 revisions to the definition of primary care services used in beneficiary \n assignment summary cms proposes to revise the definition of primary care services to include: (1) advance care planning codes (cpt 99497 and 99498); (2) administration of health risk assessment service codes (cpt 96160 and 96161); (3) prolonged evaluation and management or psychotherapy service(s) beyond the typical service time of the primary procedure (cpt 99354 and 99355); (4) annual depression screening service code (hcpcs g0444), alcohol misuse screening service codes (hcpcs g0442); and (6) alcohol misuse counseling service code (hcpcs g0443). cms also proposes to include: (1) gpc1x add-on code, for the visit complexity inherent to evaluation and management associated with certain primary care services; (2) gcg0x add-on code for visit complexity inherent to evaluation and management associated with certain specialties; and (3) gpro1, an additional add-on code for prolonged evaluation and management or psychotherapy services beyond the typical service time of the primary procedure.\n administrator verma page 21 of 25 october 15, 2018\n services billed under cpt 99304-99318 when the service is furnished in a snf by analyzing facility claims data files.\n cms welcomes comment on the new codes they are proposing to add to the definition of primary care services used for the purposes of assigning beneficiaries to mssp acos. in addition, cms seeks comments on their proposal to revise the method for excluding services identified by cpt 99304-99318 when furnished in a snf.\n aafp response in general, the aafp is supportive of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed changes to the definition of primary care services. in our comments on the 2019 medicare pfs proposed rule, we oppose the creation of gpc1x, gcg0x, and gpro1. however, should cms finalize those codes, we would only support the inclusion of gpc1x and gpro1.\n the aafp agrees it is appropriate to exclude services billed at a snf and supports the proposed updated policy.\n\nii.e.4.b(1) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 modification of quality performance scores for all acos in affected areas \n summary cms proposes to apply determinations made under the quality payment program (qpp) with respect to whether an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance has occurred and the identification of the affected geographic areas and applicable time periods. cms would have the sole discretion to determine the time period, the percentage of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries residing in the affected areas, and the location of the aco legal entity. cms will determine an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal entity location using the address on file in the cms aco application and management system.\n cms proposes to use the following approach when 25 percent of beneficiaries reside in an area affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance or the aco legal entity is located in such an area: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minimum quality score would be set equal to the mean quality score for all mssp acos for the applicable performance year. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 if the aco completely and accurately reports all quality measures, cms would use the higher of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance score or the mean quality performance score. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 if the aco receives the mean mssp quality performance score, the aco would not be eligible for bonus points. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 for acos that receive the mean quality score, the next year the aco submits data, cms would measure quality improvement based on the comparison between the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance and in the most recently available prior performance year in which the aco reported data.\n cms would use the alternative scoring methodology for acos affected by a disaster in any month in 2019.\n administrator verma page 22 of 25 october 15, 2018\n reside in an area identified under qpp as being affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance or if the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal entity is in such area, it is reasonable to conclude an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance has been adversely affected. the aafp encourages cms to continue measuring this 25 percent threshold and other percentage thresholds as test cases. for instance, cms might test whether 5 or 10 percent is also as likely to cause an impact on quality scores.\n disasters can also affect health care providers billing under the tax identification number (tin) of the aco, and as a result, can disrupt routine operations related to participation in mssp and achievement of program goals. the aafp encourages cms to include physicians and other health clinicians as an additional method to identify if the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance has been affected. to help cms develop this policy, if 50 percent of the national provider identifiers (npis) billing under the tin are in an impacted area, based on the practice location listed in the provider enrollment, chain and ownership system (pecos), cms should automatically apply the extreme and uncontrollable circumstance policy.\n in the event cms determines an aco is being affected by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, the aafp believes the quality performance score could be set to the mean, but should not be used to calculate future benchmarks or subsequent year thresholds until complete and accurate reporting can be achieved. setting quality benchmarks to an artificial mean is not a valid approach to determine legitimate savings and losses.\n cms must be transparent regarding the criteria used to determine the time period in which an aco is identified as being in extreme and uncontrollable circumstances. furthermore, cms must work closely with medicare administrative contractors (macs) and the federal emergency management agency (fema) to communicate these provisions to aco entities.\n\nii.e.5 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 program data and quality measures \n summary cms wishes to align their mssp policies with the priorities identified in the opioid misuse strategy. cms is considering what data, including what aggregated medicare part d data, could be useful to acos to combat opioid misuse in their assigned beneficiary population. acos currently receive part d prescription drug event (pde) data on prescribed opioids for their assigned beneficiaries who have not opted out of data sharing.\n cms seeks suggestions for other types of aggregate data related to opioid use that could be added for informational purposes to the aggregate quarterly and annual reports cms provides to acos. they are particularly interested in high-impact aggregate data that would reflect gaps in quality of care, patient safety, multiple aspects of care, and drivers of cost.\n types of data cms has begun considering include filled prescriptions for opioids, number of beneficiaries with a concurrent prescription of opioids and benzodiazepines, and number of beneficiaries with opioid prescriptions above a certain daily morphine equivalent dosage threshold.\n cms is considering the following relevant national quality forum (nqf)-endorsed measure: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 nqf #2940 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 nqf #2950 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 nqf #2951 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer\n administrator verma page 23 of 25 october 15, 2018\n aafp response effective state prescription drug monitoring programs (pdmps) must facilitate the interstate exchange of registry information as called for under the national all schedules prescription electronic reporting act. we advocate for physicians to use their state pdmp before prescribing any potentially abused pharmaceutical product. however, the success of this advocacy depends on state reporting systems that are accessible, timely, and interoperable. we urge cms to work with other sectors at the national and state level to help integrate these systems and improve their effectiveness.\n we also support the inclusion of the three proposed measures in the aco measure set (nqf #2940, nqf #2950, and nqf #2951). however, as new measures are developed, we strongly urge cms to ensure alignment and harmonization across all cms quality performance programs. to that end, we would suggest the development of a measure for consultation of the pdmp and outcome measures related to opioid use.\n\nii.e.6 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 promoting interoperability \n summary beginning in performance year 2019 and subsequent performance years, cms is proposing that any track that does not meet the financial risk standard to be an aapm must attest and certify at the time of application to the mssp and with each annual certification, that at least 50 percent of the eligible clinicians (ecs) participate in the aco use cehrt to document and communicate clinical care to their patients or other health care providers.\n for acos that meet the aapm financial risk standard, cms is proposing to align the proposed cehrt-use threshold with the criterion on use of cehrt established for aapms. cms anticipates that this threshold will apply to track 2, track 3, and track 1+ for performance years beginning january 1, 2019. for performance years beginning on july 1, 2019, the threshold would apply to basic level e and the enhanced track.\n if finalized, cms believes the new cehrt thresholds required for mssp eligibility would replace the need for the current aco quality measure \u00e2\u0080\u009cuse of cehrt (aco-11).\u00e2\u0080\u009d to meet aapm cehrt-use criterion under the mssp, a penalty or reward must be applied to an apm entity based on the degree of cehrt use among its ecs. cms believes their proposal to impose specific cehrt-use requirements on acos participating in the mssp would eliminate the need for the separate cehrt-use criterion applicable to mssp apms.\n aafp response the aafp is supportive of these proposals. we support all efforts to create alignment across programs. cms has also stated its intentions for basic track level e and the enhanced track to qualify as aapms. as such, we would support the logical alignment of the cehrt requirements for those tracks with the cehrt aapm criterion in the qpp. to allow for consistency, we believe it would be appropriate to apply this criterion to all mssp acos, including those that do not meet the aapm financial risk standards.\n the aafp appreciates efforts to reduce complexity and supports the removal of the quality measure aco-11 from the mssp measure set.\n\nii.f \u00e2\u0080\u0093 applicability of proposed policies to track 1+ model acos \n administrator verma page 24 of 25 october 15, 2018\n track 1+ model. existing track 1+ model acos would be able to complete the remainder of their current agreement period in the model, or terminate their current participation agreements (for the track 1+ model and the mssp) and apply to enter a new mssp agreement period under either the basic track (level e) or the enhanced track, depending upon whether the aco is low or high revenue. the snf three-day rule waiver would be available starting july 1, 2019, for eligible track 1+ model acos that apply and are approved for the waiver.\n there are two ways the proposed policies would become applicable to track 1+ model acos\u00e2\u0080\u0094 through revisions to: (1) existing regulations that currently apply to track 1+ model acos, and (2) aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s track 1+ model participation agreement.\n cms seeks comment on these considerations and any other issues they may not have discussed related to the effect of the proposed policies on acos that entered the track 1+ model beginning in 2018. cms notes that these acos will complete their participation in the track 1+ model by no later than december 31, 2020, or sooner in the case of acos that entered the model at the start of their second or third performance year within their current three-year agreement period.\n aafp response the aafp is supportive of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 application of the proposed policies to those participating in track 1+ acos. any early termination and transition to the basic or enhanced tracks should be at the discretion of the track 1+ participants. we strongly urge cms to delay the implementation of all proposed policies until january 1, 2020.\n iv \u00e2\u0080\u0093 regulatory impact analysis summary cms anticipates the average impact of the proposed changes to be approximately $2.24 billion in lower federal spending over 10 years from 2019 through 2028. cms expects a drop in participation, mainly because the program will be less likely to attract new aco formation in future years as the number of risk-free years and maximum sharing rate available to new acos would be reduced. the changes are expected to increase continued participation from existing acos. cms requests comment on the aspects of the rule that may incentivize behavior that could affect participation in the program and potential shared savings payments.\n aafp response the aafp concurs with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 analysis that the decreased attractiveness of the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one- sided tracks will deter the formation of new acos. we believe this is contrary to the goals of the macra legislation and the goals of this administration. cms also believes the proposed policies will increase participation from existing acos. while we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 desire to provide improved incentives for these acos, it is unclear how many existing track 1 acos will continue in the program. under the current proposal, the shared savings rate for existing track 1 acos is significantly reduced and they will be forced to assume downside risk. to address these concerns, we ask cms to increase the shared savings rate for acos in basic tracks a-d to 50 percent and allow new acos to participate in the upside-only levels for three years.\n administrator verma page 25 of 25 october 15, 2018\n value-based payment in the first place. moreover, the mips pathway was intentionally designed to be difficult and drive practices to apms. we strongly urge cms to make additional pathways available for small and rural practices as soon as possible.\n we appreciate the opportunity to make these comments. please contact erin solis, regulatory compliance strategist, at 913-906-6000 or esolis@aafp.org, with any

ways that preserve dignity and encourage independence. we envision a future where high-quality, affordable health care and supports for daily living are delivered on each person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own terms, according to that individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs, values, and preferences.\n the foundation appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 focus on transparency and person-centeredness in implementing the accountable care organization (aco) provisions of the bipartisan budget act of 2018, specifically those related to voluntary alignment and beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to opt in. in many california rural communities, acos are the only value-based model of care available to offer any form of care coordination. however, people really aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t aware that acos exist, and there is little information to promote their potential value as an option. our comments address informed choice, drawing on knowledge gained through field testing a new health care decision-support tool for people eligible for both medicare and medicaid. mycaremychoice.org includes information on acos in addition to capitated models of care across california.\n an individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary clinician for alignment with an aco allows more choice, and creates space for more meaningful engagement in the aco model of care. with this change, we recommend that individuals receive notification of their ability to identify their primary care provider (and the designation process) during the first visit of the year with any provider in the aligned aco. in response to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquiry, we also recommend these notices include clear information about aco activities that have a tangible impact on the care experience. such items could include information on care coordination, beneficiary incentive programs, and the waiver of the 3-day rule regarding skilled nursing facility coverage. informed choice for beneficiaries to opt in: we are pleased to see implementation of this option. we believe the ability to opt in will encourage beneficiary engagement and help drive demand for coordinated, value-based care within medicare fee-for-service. the challenge lies in informing people of their care choices -- providing clear information, and an easy process for opting in. by including acos in mycaremychoice.org, the foundation learned first-hand how little consumer-facing information is available. we recommend cms require acos to develop transparent, culturally competent communications for their websites to inform individuals about their potential value, as well as how to opt in. thank you for the opportunity to comment.  please feel free to contact us for any additional information.\n sincerely,\n\n\n bruce a.

an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our community.\r\nsincerely,\r\njessicah s. p. collins, m.d.\r\ndiabetes and

success dear administrator verma: the california primary care association (cpca) represents more than 1,300 nonprofit community clinics and health centers (chc) in california that provide comprehensive quality health care services to low-income, uninsured, and underserved californians.  cpca members include federally qualified health centers (fqhcs) and other licensed community and free clinics throughout the state.  one in six californians are served by cchcs, translating into an annual patient base of approximately 6.5 million with 20 million encounters in 2017.\n fqhcs serve a unique role in california\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care safety net. by design, fqhcs are located in medically underserved, low-income rural and urban communities and are one of the few providers who open their doors to anyone regardless of their ability to pay. on average, approximately 8% of california fqhc patients are eligible for medicare, though that number can range up to 39% and is notably higher in rural communities. most fqhc medicare patients are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid, and experience unique challenges due to their advanced age coupled with low incomes.  these challenges include high rates of chronic disease, multiple co-morbid conditions, and social and community factors that can impact their health.  because of the particularly vulnerable demographic of their patients, fqhcs contemplating risk arrangements must be especially thoughtful about risk stratification and rate setting.\n fqhc patients are not only affected by complex medical needs, but by co-occurring social needs such as food insecurity, homelessness, and lack of social support. current risk adjustment models do not adequately capture patient risk beyond traditional diagnostic criteria. this essentially penalizes providers and organizations that treat populations with greater social needs with lower risk scores (ultimately resulting in a lower financial benchmark).\n\n page | 2\n cpca member health centers are represented at the federal level by the national association of community health centers (nachc).  cpca joins nachc in responding to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pathways to success proposed rule.  like nachc, we believe that the proposed rule includes important steps toward increased success in the medicare shared savings program (mssp), while also raising areas of concern and questions that can use clarification.  in summary, we join nachc in focusing our comments on the following areas: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 health centers are important partners in accountable care arrangements, and are interested in pursuing value-based care in order to produce cost savings for the system and enhanced quality of care for beneficiaries. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 cms should invest in a more gradual pathway to increased levels of financial risk for provider-led accountable care organizations (acos). \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 many fqhcs, because they provide care to some of the most underserved communities, require additional investment to prepare for two-sided risk arrangements. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 increased flexibility in the ability to provide telehealth services will support health centers participating in the pathways to success program. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 a more appropriate benchmarking process will support participating health centers in delivering the best care for the vulnerable populations they serve. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 cms should be mindful of inadvertently causing \u00e2\u0080\u009ccherry-picking\u00e2\u0080\u009d of patients by allowing acos to provide beneficiary incentives.\n health centers are important partners in accountable care arrangements, and are interested in pursuing value-based care in order to produce cost savings for the system and enhanced quality of care for beneficiaries.\n fqhcs are mission driven to provide their patients with the highest quality care even within a safety-net system and limited resources.  this mission has lead fqhcs to serve as trailblazers in care and payment delivery transformations, seeking constantly for better and more efficient ways to deliver care to their communities.  health centers are leading the way in implementing team-based care, integrating medical and behavioral health, and in embracing patient centered health home initiatives.\n\n page | 3\n\n in addition to the cutting edge health center efforts listed above, many california fqhcs have joined with other providers within their local delivery systems to develop and participate in accountable care organizations (aco) under the medicare shared savings program (mssp). in fact, at last count, california had fifteen fqhcs participating in acos, including one provider-led mssp aco that is exclusively made up of fqhcs.  needless to say there is great interest among california\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fqhcs in exploring value-based payment systems such as the mssp.  we encourage cms to see fqhcs as partners in exploring a value-based and high quality system of care. cms should invest in a more gradual pathway to increased levels of financial risk for provider-led accountable care organizations (acos). health center participation in value-based care models \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ranging from acos to multi-payer initiatives \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have demonstrated cost-savings and high-quality outcomes. in fact, a review of the 2014 mssp performance year found that 44 percent of provider-led acos that included at least one fqhc achieved shared savings compared to just 28 percent of all acos. furthermore, health centers often participate in provider-led acos, and these acos in both upside-only and two-sided risk arrangements saved more money in performance year 2017 than acos in only two-sided risk arrangements ($0.182 billion versus $0.033 billion, a difference of nearly $150 million).1 clearly, health centers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 record of cost-efficient, high quality and comprehensive care health centers provide makes them powerful drivers of cost savings in accountable care arrangements. as health centers often operate on razor thin margins, it can be challenging for them to take on a two-sided risk arrangement and, most especially, the high level of financial risk proposed in the pathways to success \u00e2\u0080\u009cenhanced\u00e2\u0080\u009d track. an investment of time and resources is required to adapt new models of care and develop new financial relationships with other providers. for many health centers, the two years cms proposes to allow for that investment through upside-only, shared savings arrangements is not sufficient. the claims data from medicare often arrives months after the fact, but this data is vital to health centers, which must adjust their care model to produce the highest quality outcomes and bend the cost curve. cpca appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recognition of the additional time many provider-led acos may need to transition to higher levels of two-sided risk by allowing provider-led acos to cycle through the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasic\u00e2\u0080\u009d track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one- sided model (level a & level b) for up to two years. however, this means that provider-led acos will be required to take on financial risk by their third year of the program. due to the pace of data sharing and the imperative to transform care models, cpca recommends cms allow provider-led acos an even more gradual pathway to two-sided risk. specifically, cpca joins nachc in recommending that cms allow provider-led acos a minimum of three years in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasic\u00e2\u0080\u009d track in an upside-only arrangement. because health centers provide care to some of the most underserved communities, they often require additional investment to prepare for two-sided risk arrangements.\n\n page | 4\n\n page | 5\n\n page | 6\n care services in specific communities. should cms decide to allow acos to incentivize beneficiaries, it should implement safeguards to ensure that higher-revenue acos do not inadvertently attract healthier patients, potentially skewing quality metrics and leaving sicker patients with fewer options. we also encourage cms to take appropriate measures to ensure that there are no anti-kickback or physician self-referral laws violated through this beneficiary incentive process.\n our final thought is that there is a significant administrative burden associated with participation in the medicare shared savings program. participation in the program (and program success) will likely continue to be limited until cms can remove the existing administrative and legal barriers to participation. unfortunately, the pathways to success model does little to address this issue.  cpca, and california\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fqhcs, would appreciate the opportunity to partner with cms to reduce administrative burden while simultaneously furthering the goals of the program.\n thank you for the opportunity to provide our suggestions. if you have questions or comments please contact me at apatterson@cpca.org.\n\n sincerely,\n\n andie patterson

shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success [cms-1701-p]\r\n\r\nwe appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed modifications of the mssp aco program titled pathways to success [cms -1701-p]. careconnectmd is a physician run medical group that is planning to apply directly for the enhanced track aco in 2019. our group is comprised of primary care providers that almost exclusively care for patients living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.\r\nour patient base consists of the frail, elderly, and suffering from multiple complex chronic conditions. most of them suffer from cognitive impairments and are near the end of life. historically, these patients cost about three times more than the usual medicare beneficiary. it is in the context of this special needs population that we suggest modifications to the current proposal that would encourage management of this high cost group of patients more appropriately and efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\nclaims-based determination of place of service 31 and 32\r\n\r\nwe are gratified to see that cms recognizes concerns expressed by other acos devoted to similar special needs populations. we support your proposal to utilize medicare claims of skilled nursing facility stays to validate the place of service of beneficiaries in nursing homes. using physician claims data alone is commonly inaccurate.\r\n\r\nextension of the agreement period from three to five years\r\n\r\nwe support this proposition because it enhances predictability and stability of program.\r\n\r\nexpansion of the snf 3 day rule waiver to include snf and long-term care settings.\r\n\r\nwe approve of your proposal to expand the snf 3-day rule waiver to all qualified facilities in risk bearing acos participating in either retrospective or prospective attribution methodologies. however, most of our beneficiaries reside in a snf or long- term care setting and therefore would not qualify under the current rules. we request modifying the waiver to include these beneficiaries. our experience in medicare advantage has demonstrated the ability to directly admit to skilled nursing from nursing homes significantly reduces unnecessary hospitalizations and saves money without compromising quality. furthermore, our accountability for down side performance incentivizes us to prevent costly unnecessary nursing home snf admissions.\r\n\r\nproposed changes to historical benchmarking and subsequent performance year adjustments\r\n\r\nwe are concerned that the proposed hcc risk adjustment to the benchmark each year may not be adequate for our population due to the rapid rate of disease progression near the end of life. our beneficiary population is almost entirely composed of patients that will expire within 3 years. we know from our experience in medicare advantage that the hcc and other medicare risk domain methodologies do not account for the additional expense of

21244-8016\nsubmitted electronically via https://www.regulations.gov/comment?d=cms-2018-0101-0001\nre: medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success [cms-1701-p]\ndear administrator, verma,\nwe appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed modifications of the mssp aco program titled pathways to success [cms -1701-p].  careconnectmd is a physician run medical group that is planning to apply directly for the enhanced track aco in 2019.  our group is comprised of primary care providers that almost exclusively care for patients living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.  by the time of application, careconnectmd aco expects to have 7000 - 9000 attributable beneficiaries, serviced by over 90 physicians and np/pas covering regions in at least 4 states. because of our years of experience in managing similar beneficiaries for numerous ma plans including isnps, we are confident that applying our expertise to the mssp program will increase the quality of care and result in meaningful savings to cms.\nour patient base consists of the frail, elderly, and suffering from multiple complex chronic conditions.  most of them suffer from cognitive impairments and are near the end of life.  historically, these patients cost about three times more than the usual medicare beneficiary.  it is in the context of this special needs population that we suggest modifications to the current proposal that would encourage management of this high cost group of patients more appropriately and efficiently.\n\nclaims-based determination of place of service 31 and 32\nwe are gratified to see that cms recognizes concerns expressed by other acos devoted to similar special needs populations.  we support your proposal to utilize medicare claims of skilled nursing facility stays to validate the place of service of beneficiaries in nursing homes.  using physician claims data alone is commonly inaccurate.\nextension of the agreement period from three to five years\nwe support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notion of enhanced predictability and stability in achievement of savings against a fixed benchmark afforded by the proposed extension of the agreement period from three to five years.\nexpansion of the snf 3 day rule waiver to include snf and long-term care settings.\nwe approve of your proposal to expand the snf 3-day rule waiver to all qualified facilities in risk bearing acos participating in either retrospective or prospective attribution methodologies. however, most of our beneficiaries reside in a snf or long- term care setting and therefore would not qualify under the current rules.  we request modifying the waiver to include these beneficiaries.  our experience in medicare advantage has demonstrated the ability to directly admit to skilled nursing from nursing homes significantly reduces unnecessary hospitalizations and saves money without compromising quality.  furthermore, our accountability for down side performance incentivizes us to prevent costly unnecessary nursing home snf admissions.\nproposed changes to historical benchmarking and subsequent performance year adjustments\nwe are concerned that the proposed risk adjustment to the benchmark each year may not be adequate for our population due to the rapid rate of disease progression near the end of life.  our beneficiary population is almost entirely composed of patients that will expire within 3 years.  we know from our experience in medicare advantage that the hcc and other medicare risk domain methodologies do not account for the additional expense of this extremely sick population, especially as the beneficiary approaches the end of life.  we suggest that adding a frailty modifier to the risk adjustment (like the pace program) would better reflect the true cost of caring for this cohort.\nwe have the same concern about the proposal to blend regional ffs expenses into the benchmarking methodology.  we support the concept of adding a regional ffs expense modifier to protect high performing acos against an unfair lowering of their benchmark.  however, we are concerned that your regional ffs cohort representing 25% of the benchmark will not be adequately adjusted for our extremely expensive population.  if not adjusted appropriately, our benchmark could be unfairly affected to the point our special needs aco becomes unviable.  indeed, a major impetus for us to become an aco is because several of our providers have been asked to leave community based acos due to their patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high ffs medicare costs.\nexpansion of the telehealth waiver to prospective risk acos\nwe support the proposed expansion of the telehealth waiver and recommend it be available to prospective and retrospective risk bearing acos.  telemedicine, in our population is proving to be a powerful tool in accomplishing real time access to clinicians, including specialists in nursing and long-term care facilities.  this prevents costly emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and expensive unnecessary testing.\ncomments on quality metrics:\npertaining to the use of opioids: we endorse the addition of opioid use quality measures.  however, we are concerned that the measures be adjusted for beneficiaries that are near the end of life.  for example, nqf 2940 \u00e2\u0080\u009copioids at high doses in persons without cancer or hospice does not capture appropriate situations in our patient population near the end of life in palliative care.\ninstitutional population adjustment to utilization metrics:  hospital utilization for our population is more than three times that of the average aco population.  readmission and admission rates from institutionalized populations should be measured against a similar cohort population.\nwe are very excited about participating in the mssp program and believe that most of the proposals in pathway to success represent improvement to its integrity and viability.  your support and encouragement for physician lead value-based models is much appreciated.  we believe the mssp program will give opportunity for physicians like us, who care for the sickest, most frail and most expensive patients, to materially improve the outcomes and reduce the cost.\nregards,\nkerry weiner,

program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success, published in the federal register on august 17, 2018\n variabilities of aco population shifts, especially with retrospective assignment. this variability is particularly prevalent within the aged-dual population. as a rural service provider aco with a large sector of our population residing in long-term care settings we have been particularly impacted by turnover in assigned populations served. the current benchmarking methodology inadequately weights increases in assignment of high needs populations residing in long term settings. we suggest factoring considerations or developing subsets that differentiate rural from urban populations, and allowances for institutional versus community-based settings. these beneficiaries comprise some of the most vulnerable, under-served, high cost, and greatest challenges to the medicare program. we have service areas without a hospital within 30 miles or a specialist within an hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drive. the more precise the benchmarking methodology, the more likely it is to reward the goals of the program and not random variabilities, or worse exploitation of methodology weaknesses. suggestion: cms physician escrow accounts- we share the program goal of widespread transition to two-sided programs. one practical tool that cms could offer acos to equip them to make the transition is to offer providers accepting medicare an option to voluntarily escrow a percentage of their claims for value-based programs. providers could then assign their escrow to an aco entering into a two-sided risk arrangement with cms. some variation of this approach could assist physician led acos with limited capitalization a path to participate in two-sided risk contracts while providing cms with sufficient collateral.\n we respectfully submit these comments and suggestions as constructively as they are intended.\n sincerely,\n

accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents\r\na strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed\r\nproviders. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared\r\nsavings program (mssp).\r\n\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained\r\nquality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the\r\nlowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant\r\ninvestments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating\r\npositive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care\r\npartners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed\r\nrule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways\r\nto success.\r\n\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced\r\ntracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of\r\npreliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the\r\noption to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some\r\nmuch-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\n\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding\r\naccess to this important program feature.\r\n\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks\r\nwill create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk\r\nscores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between\r\nnewly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that\r\nlimiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect\r\nproviders who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can\r\nexperience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be\r\nadequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a\r\nbenchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to\r\nunderstand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the\r\nimportance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our\r\ndemonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our\r\naco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared\r\nsavings unattainable.\r\n\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged\r\nby the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a\r\nstrong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of\r\nclaims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable\r\nreports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\n\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office\r\nworkflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of\r\nimportant documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also,\r\nwhile i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of\r\nimplementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense\r\nto my offices operations.\r\n\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look\r\nforward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow\r\nme and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\njay sailer, md\r\nmaury river family practice, llc\r\naugusta care partners     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n

success,\u00e2\u0080\u009d released by the public inspection desk on august 9, 2018 and published in the federal register on august 17, 2018 by the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms).  the page  numbers referenced in the below comments correspond to the public inspection desk release. wellcare health plans, inc. focuses exclusively on providing government-sponsored managed care services  to  5.5  million  families,  children,  seniors  and  individuals  with  complex  medical  needs primarily through medicaid, medicare advantage and medicare prescription drug plans, as well as individuals in the health insurance marketplace. collaborative health systems (chs), a wellcare company, is a management services organization that partners  with primary care physicians as they move to value-based  payment systems.  as of october 2018, chs manages two next generation model accountable care organizations (acos), 15 medicare shared savings program (mssp) acos, and partners with physician groups in other value and quality-based models such as independent physician associations (ipas). chs acos serve over 169,000 medicare beneficiaries in 11 states plus the district of columbia. wellcare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision is to be a leader in government-sponsored healthcare programs in partnership with our members, providers, and government partners.  we  have a  long-standing commitment to our federal and state partners to deliver value, access, quality, cost savings, and budget predictability. it is from this vantage point that we offer these responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3 wellcare  asks  cms  to  consider  changes  to  their proposed basic  track  glide  path,  both  in  the number of years an aco can stay in one-sided risk and in percentage of savings an aco can realize. our alternative proposal is outlined in the chart below.  we believe there are clear benefits to allowing an aco to stay in a one-sided model for three years while requiring them to transition to two-sided risk during the fourth year, or level d.  the three-year timeframe is reflective of the current regulation, which allows for a three-year agreement period in one-sided risk.  we also urge cms to reconsider the proposed reduction in shared savings for the basic track to be more closely aligned with the percentages  in current  regulation.   these  changes  will  incentivize  program  participation  even  as cms requires acos to transition to two-sided risk faster, and will also achieve cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal of stability for the mssp. basic track glide path enhanced  track (current track 3)  level a, level b, and level c ( one- sided model) level d (risk/reward) level e (risk/ reward) shared savings (once msr met or exceeded) 1st dollar

to exceed 15% of updated benchmark\n\n\n\n\n 4 wellcare is committed to the aco program and its sustainability.  we welcome the opportunity to meet with cms to further discuss our alternative proposal for the basic and enhanced tracks. cms proposes to \u00e2\u0080\u009callow eligible acos in the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path the option to elect entry into a higher  level of risk and potential reward under the basic track for each performance year within their agreement period.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  wellcare supports this proposal.  we agree with cms that this flexibility allows  an aco to determine its own readiness to take on risk, as determined by factors such as experience with the program. proposals for permitting annual election of beneficiary assignment methodology (page 92) cms  proposes  to  allow  basic  and  enhanced  track  acos  to  elect  prospective  assignment  or preliminary  prospective  assignment  with retrospective reconciliation prior  to  the  start  of  each agreement period, and to change that selection for each subsequent performance year.  wellcare supports this proposal.  some acos may prefer the prospective assignment because they want to know who is on their patient panel at the start of the performance year.  this methodology may help acos identify high-risk individuals and better strategize their care management techniques.  other acos  may  prefer  the  accuracy  of preliminary  prospective  assignment  with  retrospective reconciliation.  giving individual acos the choice of beneficiary assignment methodology and the option to switch assignment methodologies allows acos to choose which methodology best fits their delivery approach. fee-for-service benefit enhancements (page 269) shared savings program snf 3-day rule waiver (page 271) cms proposes \u00e2\u0080\u009cto expand eligibility for the snf 3-day rule waiver to include acos participating in a two-sided model under preliminary prospective assignment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  we support the expansion of eligibility for  this  waiver  beyond  those  acos  participating  in  track 3 or enhanced to those in basic participating  in  the  two-sided  model.    expanding  the  eligibility  provides  an  additional  incentive  to acos to take on two-sided risk and provides additional resources for these acos to ensure they are delivering the necessary care and services to their patient panel. billing and payment for telehealth services (page 281) cms  notes  that  its  proposals  regarding  telehealth  services  would apply  to acos  in a two-sided model  and  enhanced  under the prospective  assignment methodology.    wellcare  supports  the proposed changes to telehealth services, especially the proposal for the home to be treated as an originating site.  we support these proposals for all acos assuming  two-sided risk, regardless of their assignment methodology.\n\n\n\n\n 5 providing tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement (page 295) beneficiary incentives (page 296) wellcare  supports  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099  proposal  to  allow  acos  to  establish  a  beneficiary  incentive  program. beneficiary  incentive  programs  bring  a  higher  focus  on  patient  engagement,  and  encourage  the patient to take control of his/her own health and wellness.  beneficiary engagement programs have been successful in other areas, such as medicaid, and we support allowing acos to create similar incentive programs. cms specifically seeks comment, on page 308, on whether or not acos \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould be required to notify cms  of  any  modification  to  its  beneficiary  incentive  program  prior  to  implementing  such modification.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  cms is also seeking comment \u00e2\u0080\u009con whether information about a beneficiary incentive program should be publicly reported by the aco or simply reports to cms annually or upon request.\u00e2\u0080\u009d in  order  for beneficiary  incentive  programs  to  be  utilized  by  acos,  they  cannot  be  overly administratively burdensome.  in its proposal, cms lists specific records required to be maintained by the aco, including the identification of each beneficiary who received a payment; the type and amount  of  each  payment; and the  date  of  the  qualifying  service  and  the  healthcare  common procedure coding  system  (hcpcs)  code.    wellcare  encourages  cms  to  adopt  a  policy  where acos must record information, but are not required to publicly report.  rather, acos should make records  available  to  cms  upon  request.  such  a  policy  balances  the  need  for  an  aco to  be accountable for its beneficiary incentive program while limiting the administrative burden of public reporting. beneficiary opt-in based assignment methodology (page 327) according to cms, some stakeholders asked cms to consider a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeneficiary opt-in methodology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which would allow \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeneficiaries to opt-in to an aco before they receive a primary care service from a  physician  in  the  aco.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   cms is  specifically  seeking  comments  on  this  alternative  beneficiary assignment methodology. wellcare  does  not  support  a  beneficiary  opt-in  based  assignment  methodology.    allowing beneficiaries  to  choose  an  aco  moves  the  program  away  from  its  fundamental  purpose.    cms defines an aco as \u00e2\u0080\u009cgroups of doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers, who come together voluntarily to give coordinated high-quality care to their medicare patients.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  acos should focus on bringing in the right doctors and providers into their organization to improve health of their patients, not recruiting patients to opt-in to the aco.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 7 aco to get an admission, discharge, and transfer (adt) notification when a patient is admitted to a  hospital,  transferred  to  another  facility,  or  discharged  from  the  hospital.  acos  are  forced  to negotiate provisions of these alerts on a  hospital by  hospital basis,  which is very costly  and time intensive. wellcare encourages  cms  to  consider  methods  to  improve  the  timely  delivery  of  patient  data, especially adt notifications, to the aco.  for our acos with access to adts from all hospitals, the 30-day readmission rate per 1,000 discharges declined by 3.2%, from 182.0 to 176.2.  our acos with limited access to adt feeds saw a small increase in 30-day all cause readmissions per 1,000 discharges.  these notifications are  essential to improving a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  health status  and  ensuring effective  coordination  of  care,  as  they  prompt  follow-up  and  improve  communication  among providers. conclusion wellcare appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on these important policy issues and to partner with cms.  if your staff would like further detail

august 17, 2018 the centers for medicare and medicaid  services (cms) published proposed rules entitled medicare shared savings program (mssp) - accountable care organizations (acos) - pathways to success (cms\u00e2\u0080\u00931701\u00e2\u0080\u0093p). in this communication, the national  organization  of state offices of rural health (nosorh) makes comment and recommendation  related to these proposed rules. nosorh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments are specific to the sections of the proposed rules which would reduce the permitted term of aco participation  in the track 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 upside only category. the comments also pertain to the proposed changes to medicare payments for acos in an upside-only category. the comments will explore how the proposed rules will  affect rural aco participation  in the aco. the comments are followed  by specific recommendations about how cms might modify its proposals to assure continued  participation  of rural health care providers in the mssp.\n general comments nosorh has assessed the current status of rural health care providers in mssp acos. based upon  this assessment nosorh has identified  the likely implications  of the proposed changes on rural acos. this analysis is summarized in the following  comments.\n rural acos - description a substantial number of accountable care organizations currently in operation include rural health care providers. an august 2018 report from the rural policy research institute (rupri) indicates  that in 2017 53 acos include a provider group that is either exclusively or largely located in non-metro locations. this represents 10.2% of the 520 total acos in the enumeration.  an additional  144 acos include  a mixed metro/nonmetro provider group. this means that an additional 27.7% of the total number of acos are having some rural impact. a january 2018 cms estimate, cited by caravan health, indicated  that 66 of 561 mssp acos (11.8%) had participation  by some rural providers. this estimate is consistent with the 2017 rupri enumeration for acos with health providers either exclusively or largely located in non-metro areas.\n almost all the rural acos are currently in track 1. the rupri report indicates that almost all acos that include rural providers are in the track 1 - upside only category. 50 of the 53 acos (94%) with health providers largely or exclusively from rural locations  are in track 1. 124 of the 144 acos (86.1%) with mixed rural/urban health providers are in track 1. both percentages are higher than the 84.8%  of all acos in track 1.\n\n such as training  and modifications  to data systems. while this average figure covers a range of different individual  aco levels of expenditure, the same survey showed that 87% of all aco respondents replied that their investments in aco startup and operation were either significant  or very significant.\n these additional costs are an important factor affecting the potential  return on investment of participating  in the mssp. if shared savings cannot offset these additional  costs, an aco will be facing a net loss. despite this reality, cms does not fully consider  the additional  costs associated with aco operation in its calculations for the program.\n rural acos face greater cost challenges than do many urban acos. rural acos generally have lower patient volumes than do urban acos. as a result, the implementation  cost per patient in rural acos is higher. it may be prohibitive. many rural acos need support to be able to cover these costs.\n the importance of upfront costs for rural acos is indicated by the significant number of rural acos supported under the aco investment model (aim) initiative - a one-time program which supports infrastructure development for rural or underserved area acos established in or before performance year 2016. according to a rupri study, in 2017 75% of acos with health providers exclusively in rural locations were aim participants. 35.6% of acos with health providers largely in rural locations were aim participants. 11.1% of acos with mixed rural/urban health providers were aim participants. these numbers point to the disparate challenges faced by rural acos in managing  the costs of running  an effective aco.\n it should be noted that aco costs are not limited to aco patients. acos will generally implement system-wide infrastructure changes for all patients, not just aco enrolled patients. for example, data processing  improvements will  often be system-wide for participating providers. in this way, aco benefits will not be limited to aco enrolled  patients. the changes in infrastructure and systems will likely lead to improvements for all patients of participating  providers. these benefits, including  quality and cost improvements, are not part of the measurement and assessment of the mssp.\n rural acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 resulting savings \u00e2\u0080\u0098savings\u00e2\u0080\u0099, as calculated  for acos are the difference between actual patient cost and the historically  benchmarked patient cost for aco enrolled patients. with smaller enrolled patient populations such as those in rural acos, the historical  costs of an enrolled population  may be volatile. if a relatively small number of patients develop serious new health problems, the service costs for the enrolled population  could quickly surpass the benchmark. this will likely put smaller rural acos at greater risk than larger, urban acos for failing  to reduce estimated costs.\n despite this challenge,  several studies indicate  that rural acos can achieve substantial medicare savings for their enrolled patient population.  these savings are achieved by acos that are largely track 1, upside only organizations:\n\n in a key study, a cms evaluation of the aim program showed that in their first performance year aim acos showed lowered medicare spending  with no sign of decrements in quality of care. the study showed that acos with upside-only financial  risk in rural areas can, with up-front funding  and management company support, achieve mssp aims.  in 2016, 41 aim acos demonstrated $105.4 million in reduced total medicare spending  relative to similar  traditional  medicare beneficiaries  in the same geographic area. 30 of the 41 acos had lower total medicare spending  than the baseline for their enrolled  patients. the aim acos showed $82.8  million  in net savings to the medicare program after subtracting earned shared savings.\n a follow-up study of aim acos showed similar  savings performance for 2017. in that year 45 aim acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including  several new first year acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 demonstrated a total of $81 million in lower medicare spending.  the aim acos had a lower per capita spending of $172 per year, a figure which surpassed the $138 per year savings of track 3 acos in the mssp for the same period. this indicates  that the downside risk assumption is not a predictive factor in the savings performance of acos, and that the performance of rural acos in track 1 is significant  even without downside risk assumption.\n several other studies point to key factors for rural aco success. some studies point to year-to-year improvement in aco performance, demonstrating an operational learning  curve. other studies show differences between physician-only aco organizations  and hospital-inclusive acos. a few studies have suggested that acos supported by professional  management companies  fare better than do others which do not. what seems clear is that understanding of aco savings performance is just beginning  to emerge. it may be premature to make major mssp changes, particularly if rural aco participation  in the program is to be maintained.\n as mentioned previously, the medicare savings gained from aco operation is not limited to aco enrolled  patients. as discussed in the mssp pathways to success proposed rule, cms estimates that the overall impact of acos, including  \u00e2\u0080\u009cspillover effects\u00e2\u0080\u009d on medicare spending  outside of the aco program, lowered spending by\n$1.8 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $4.2 billion  (0.5 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1.2 percent) in 2016 alone. these analyses provide \n important evidence that acos save more money for medicare than what is reflected in the basic evaluations of performance.\n it should be noted that those acos which  fail to achieve savings over their enrolled patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benchmarks do not actually \u00e2\u0080\u0098lose\u00e2\u0080\u0099 money. these acos only fail to achieve targeted savings. services to aco enrolled  patients are paid on the same fee for service payment schedule that is used for non-enrolled  patients. should  acos leave the mssp these patients would continue  to cost medicare the same. the exit of acos from the program would simply eliminate incentives for reducing cost and improving quality in the future.\n\n\n\n\n readiness of rural acos for risk assumption a survey conducted by naaco of all mssp acos indicated  that most of the acos in track 1 would likely leave the mssp if they were to prematurely lose the 5% apm incentive for participation. this survey showed that only 33% of respondents in track 1 would be somewhat likely or very likely to continue their participation. the potential drop in track 1 aco participation  in the mssp would be even greater if these acos were further forced to assume downside risk. a 2018 naaco survey indicated  that 71% of all track 1 acos would likely leave the mssp if forced to assume downside risk. given that 86% of rural acos are in track 1, elimination  of upside-only risk arrangements would likely lead to an exodus of most rural acos from the program.\n being accountable  for health care does not necessarily require the inappropriate assumption  of risk. while  rural acos, as a cohort, have demonstrated the ability to generate medicare spending reductions,  in any given year some rural acos may not be able to achieve savings. if they were to be forced into inappropriate  assumption of losses, they might face financial  challenges in those years. inappropriate assumption  of risk by fragile rural provider organizations  could  threaten rural health system sustainability and runs counter to the purpose of the aca \u00e2\u0080\u0093 improving access to affordable, quality health care.\n summary nosorh believes that the aim of the mssp in rural areas should  be to permit widespread participation of rural health care providers in accountable care payment mechanisms. this does not necessarily involve the assumption of inappropriate risk. while  some rural acos are ready to assume a level of downside  risk, a larger number may not be immediately able to make this transition.  in addition,  required assumption  of inappropriate risk may create disincentives for other rural health care providers from joining  into new aco arrangements.\n nosorh believes that incentive mechanisms  should be maintained  to permit rural acos to generate medicare savings on a discontinuous basis \u00e2\u0080\u0093 allowing  shared savings in some years while not putting rural health services at risk in years when no savings are forthcoming. this would  require continuation  and enhancement of the track 1 type payment arrangements. nosorh  believes that these arrangements are a net benefit to medicare. they would permit patient payment savings in some years and would cost no more than patient payments on the current fee for service schedule in others.  in line with this perspective nosorh makes the following  recommendations  to cms.\n recommendations in line with the analysis discussed previously, nosorh  makes the following recommendations  to cms. recommendation 1 - maintain current track 1 incentive structure: nosorh believes that the current multi-year participation  arrangements give rural acos realistic term for implementation  of accountable care systems. nosorh recommends that cms maintain the existing track 1 structure and incentives for both continuing and new rural acos.\n\n recommendation 2 - maintain eligibility of track 1 acos for apm incentives: nosorh believes that participation  in a track 1 aco shows a commitment of a health care organization  to accountable  care. track 1 acos have been shown to generate savings for medicare with no loss of quality. nosorh recommends that cms maintain the eligibility of track 1 acos for alternative payment model (apm) incentives and mips exclusions.\n recommendation 3 - permanent extension of track 1 aco arrangements: nosorh believes that assumption  of downside risk is not essential for successful accountable care. nosorh  feels that rural acos can contribute to accountable  care and to medicare savings on a continuing  basis while operating as track 1 acos. nosorh recommends that cms consider allowing acos to operate with track 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 upside only - arrangements on a permanent basis.\n recommendation 4 - additional support for costs of aco participation: nosorh recognizes that all acos face substantial implementation  and operational costs. these costs can make aco participation  prohibitive for many rural acos, particularly those in underserved areas.  nosorh recommends that cms use the lessons of the aim program to develop new support mechanisms for acos in rural and underserved areas.\n\n", "0297": "allow acos to start a level a even

based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos.  these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community.  as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success.\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finite resources.\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total population, instead of differentiating between \u00e2\u0080\u009cnewly assigned\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinuously assigned\u00e2\u0080\u009d beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality,  the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my office\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations.\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our community.\nsincerely,\nrobert w. mcmahon, md, faan\naugusta health neurology\naugusta care partners\n\n", "0299": "as you know, under the current medicare shared savings program (mssp) beneficiary assignment regulations, an np is an authorized aco professional, but their patients cannot be assigned to the aco unless they receive one primary care service from a primary care physician participating with the aco each year. this has inhibited np practices from joining or establishing shared savings aco's and limited the scope of the shared savings program (mssp). if the mssp is to continue to develop and improve patient access, quality and cost effectiveness, it must be fully inclusive of nps and their patients.\r\n\r\ntherefore, i support cms' proposal to update the voluntary alignment option for beneficiary assignment in the shared savings program (mssp). this proposal would allow a patient to choose an np as their primary shared savings aco clinician and be assigned to an mssp aco without requiring a primary care service from a primary care physician. this proposal will increase the participation of nps and their patients in the mssp and is consistent with a patient-centered approach to health care delivery.\r\n\r\ni am a nurse practitioner in a very rural clinic. we are in a town of population 475. my clinic is in an aco as we are trying very hard to keep afloat. right now my patients cannot be counted in the aco without seeing a physician. there are no physicians in my

are nurse practitioners and they already cut me from the group and i had to buy the clinic to keep it open. why would they even want to help me by seeing my patients? this is just a bad law. it is

\r\n      npg health collaborative llc - aco response re: cms proposed rule pathways to success\n in the early spring of 2016, nine independent critical access hospitals, located in nebraska and northern kansas, started looking at what it would take to apply to participate in cms medicare shared savings program aco.  these facilities had very little experience in valued-based medicine or population health management. it was impossible for any of these facilities to apply on their own, as they would not be able to meet the required 5000 attributed beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needed to be approved by\ncms.  working together in this collaborative allowed the hospitals, clinics and providers to start \n working together to develop the infrastructure and processes to develop a successful collaborative\naco. \n\n the application process was completed in the fall of 2016 and we were approved effective january 1, 2017 for our 3-year agreement in a track 1 mssp.  we had 9 critical access hospitals/rural health clinics/providers with over 9,000 attributed medicare beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in our first year.  in 2018 we added 5 more critical access hospitals and now have just under 16,000 attributed medicare beneficiaries.  since the aco investment model (aim) funding was not available to us when we started, the costs of infrastructure and support is being supported by the critical access hospitals who have already narrow margins to support this development.\n the plan when starting this journey was that it would take us up to 6 years as a track 1 mssp aco to be able to complete the development of infrastructure, processes and the comfort level to move to a risk model aco.  the proposed changes in the pathways to success proposed rules shortens that to 4 years and will make it very difficult to complete the development needed to prepare rural critical access hospitals to move to a risk track.  it was also our plan to continue to add other critical access hospitals to our collaborative once we gained traction and developed expertise.  with the proposed rule changes limiting risk tracks to one or two years will make it very difficult to attract other critical access hospitals to join the collaborative.   at this time very few critical access hospitals in our state participate in an mssp and we believe, given the proper amount of time, others would join into this effort.  we recently received our first year results and although we did not achieve shared savings, we are within the 3% corridor of our first year benchmark.\n please allow the time needed to organize these efforts and to encourage other critical access hospitals and providers to join into the program.\n sincerely,\n\n\n rodney g. triplett npg health

medicare shared savings program; accountable care\norganizations--pathways to success\ndear administrator verma,\nthe national rural health association (nrha) is pleased to offer comments on the cms proposed rule for the medicare shared savings program: accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success. we greatly appreciate your continued commitment to the needs of the 62 million americans residing in rural areas, as reflected in cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s implementation of a rural health strategy.  we look forward to our continued collaboration to improve health care access and quality throughout rural america.\nnrha is a non-profit membership organization with more than 21,000 members nationwide that provides leadership on rural health issues.  our membership includes nearly every component of rural america\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care infrastructure, including rural community hospitals, critical access hospitals, doctors, nurses and patients.  we work to improve rural america\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health needs through government advocacy, communications, education and research.\nwe appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued emphasis on narrowing the gap between rural patients and providers. this letter outlines suggestions and recommendations that we believe will strengthen this proposed rule to allow financially vulnerable rural providers a meaningful opportunity to participate in the program. we look forward to our continued collaboration to further refine the program to meet our shared goals of robust rural participation coupled with local access to care for rural beneficiaries.\nnrha urges cms to maintain a one-sided risk option for rural and safety net providers. while we understand your desire to move more providers into two-sided risk we believe most rural providers would opt out rather than participating, leaving the program without rural participation and rural populations without the added benefits of the aco program. acos have provided increased population health activities that provide an opportunity to keep the population healthy, while also providing providers the flexibility to address patient needs and care coordination that may not be otherwise permissible. this provides real benefits to the patients and providers. however, rural providers are safety net providers essential for the health of their communities. without these critical local points of access to care, rural communities would quickly wither and die.\nrural hospitals are often the number one or two largest employer in town and attracting other employers in contingent on them having local access to a hospital with the services they envision their workforce needing. furthermore, most physicians in rural are hospital based, or have a crucial connection with the hospital. if the hospital closes, those physicians leave the community along with the nurses and pharmacist and other professionals. currently 44 percent of rural hospitals are operating at a loss, up from 40 percent just a year ago. since 2010, 89 rural hospitals have closed and left their community without local access to care.\nthe risk, particularly as felt by rural hospital boards, would be deemed too great to remain in an aco if two-sided risk was required. it is important to understand the governance structure of rural community health systems. the vast majority of rural community hospital boards of directors are not steeped in the world of health care delivery and are new to delivery system reform and payment. the board is frequently made of up community leaders, for example a farmer or rancher, school teachers, clergy from the local church, bankers, and other community leaders. the board fully understand the community and works diligently to understand the hospital operations to make the best decisions for the community. the board\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval is required to move into risk arrangements. appropriately, the board\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main concern is the viability of the hospital and thus the community at large. such a board is unlikely to accept an arrangement where leadership cannot guarantee they will not have to make a payment to cms for losses. caravan health, a national rural aco, has experience with more than 250 rural health systems and their boards of directors, they estimate that very few rural health system boards will approve a risk arrangement and will terminate participation in the mssp, or not begin the journey towards better community health.\npat schou, executive director of the illinois critical access hospital network (which has a number of hospitals in an aco) said that their hospitals \u00e2\u0080\u009chave reduced the spend [for medicare] but have not reached shared savings [being able to reap additional payments from medicare]. many have negative margins or maybe a positive margin of 1 percent so how can they actually take on risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d she points out their network rural hospitals spent two times as much money investing in the aco as they received from aim dollars. \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t promise [hospital] boards that they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to write a check [to medicare to cover any loses]. you cannot do anything without board approval. the flaw is boards will never say yes to this level of risk\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009cto assume risk they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that but $83 million shows we benefit medicare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nit is this background that is essential to understand in order to understand why rural hospitals are unable to take on down side risk. it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that they are not providing excellent care that is of high value. it is simply that the risk is too great. even rural hospitals that are not part of the 44 percent operating at a loss have razor thin margins. what cms would deem a \u00e2\u0080\u009csmall\u00e2\u0080\u009d loss would be catastrophic for these small providers and could result in closure. that closure then results in loss of access to necessary care for the community, inability to attract or keep local businesses resulting in a cascading loss of other community businesses such as the local bank, grocery store, and restaurants. ultimately, as one reporter discovered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you want to

willing to gamble.\n\u0002 a hospital crisis is killing rural communities. this state is \u00e2\u0080\u0098ground zero.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by lauren weber and andy miller, 9/22/2017. available at https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rural-hospitals-closure-georgia_us_59c02bf4e4b087fdf5075e38\nrural acos face the issue of a vulnerable patient population that is older, sicker, and poorer than their urban counterparts, including a higher chronic disease burden. furthermore, with the closure of 89 rural hospitals since 2010, rural america is also facing increasing issues of access to care. rural beneficiaries must travel further to receive care in emergency as well as cost saving preventive services and ongoing monitoring and care for chronic disease. these same rural beneficiaries often struggle with lack of transportation or the financial resources to make these medically necessary trips. all of these factors highlight the need for rural acos to manage this vulnerable population, while also highlighting the reasons that making rural aco unable to sustainably take on downside risk at this point in the program. rural providers have made great strides in successfully working with and managing this vulnerable patient population, however, the impact of small numbers, provider shortages, cultural challenges, sociodemographic challenges, limited financial resources for necessary data collection and management, and limited access to health care necessitate the ability to remain in the program without requiring acos to accept two-sided risk.\nfurthermore, these providers have already taken on a downside risk in the form of the investments required to participate and succeed in the aco program. some expenditures expended by a hospital participating in an aco, margret mary health in batesville indiana included, educating physicians, staff and board members, the cost associated with the application process approval with cms, management time to evaluate and implement actions, it system to process the cms data and make it useable for the care team, care coordinator rns to work with our chronic patients who were not making progress, and costs associated with the waiver program (i.e. we purchased and van and hired staff to pick up patients for appointments who have undependable transportation). this is by no means an exhaustive list and is only a single hospital participating in an aco. the hospital is pleased with the changes and the aco participation is paying off in higher quality of care that has resulted in greatly improved diabetes compliance rates, reduced the number of er visits and admissions for many of the patients in the program. while the hospital continues to participate because of their strong mission to help the patients in their community the positive changes in patient care have resulted in reduction of er visits and inpatient revenue, a further \u00e2\u0080\u009ccost\u00e2\u0080\u009d of aco participation. indeed, then secretary of hhs sylvia burwell estimate that the startup cost for an aco at a 200-bed hospital is $5.3 million and the annual operating costs for the aco is $6.3 million. since many of the costs are not based on the number of participating patients, the cost per covered life is often higher in a rural context.\nfinally, there is no credible evidence presented by cms that demonstrates that taking on two side-risk increases performance. indeed, the risk-free aim acos saved cms $22.70 per beneficiary per month compared to risk-bearing nextgen acos, which only saved $18.20 per beneficiary per month. the lower shared savings for the aim acos resulted even greater savings to the trust fund, $20 per beneficiary per month vs only $11.20 for nextgen. though we speak in averages, these results were not equally achieved by all participating acos, despite all having the same down side risk motivations. in fact, it was only four of the eighteen nexgen acos that generated more than half of the resulting savings.\ntaking on risk is not the ultimate goal, the goal of the aco program is to produce savings, or flat spending, to the medicare trust fund without a degradation in quality. two-sided risk is only a potential tool in achieving this goal. however, a forced push towards taking on risk will result in rural providers simply dropping out of the program since they cannot take on risk. the ultimate result will be rural patients and providers lose the benefits of participation in the aco program and the medicare trust fund loses out on the clearly demonstrated benefits of rural participation, including lower hospitalization rates and better care management. the proposed push for rural taking on risk would result in either rural providers pulling out of the program or the potential that an aberrant year or couple of patients could result in financial loses that could result in closure of the aco or participating hospitals or practices.\nsmall and rural acos have achieved excellent clinical quality scores above national averages even as they beat their spending benchmarks, however, the natural year-to-year variation in performance and risk of paying back shared losses even in a single year is too much uncertainty for providers that already struggle with low or negative margins. experience shows that rural acos overall have very strong financial performance under a limited risk scenario. the aco investment model (aim) program included 45 acos that received start-up funding from cms in 2015 and 2016. this cohort of mostly rural providers in track 1 saved more per capita than track 3 acos for the 2017 performance year even without downside risk. cms should allow these acos to continue these promising results without increasing the level of risk.\ncentral to this discussion about aco risk is scale. put simply, smaller organizations are less able to take on risk than those with more attributed lives. earlier this year, caravan health published data showing the variation in results from 2013 to 2016 based on aco size.  these charts illustrate the relationship between variable results and aco size. this first chart shows the annual savings and losses of all acos plotted against number of patient lives.\nthis second chart shows the year over year change in savings and losses in acos by size.\nthe charts make the relationship clear \u00e2\u0080\u0093 smaller acos have much less control over the level of savings or losses they experience each year. these acos can be doing everything right and still not realize savings due to the inherent unpredictability of year over year health care costs. the aco program would be ill-served by pushing smaller and rural acos into risk - the proof is in the data.\ncms should consider policy alternatives for those acos who cannot tolerate being held financially responsible for making a payment for losses they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control. one option is adjusting the corridors for determining shared savings and losses. the current minimum savings/loss rates function as risk corridors to protect both the aco and the government from the volatility of health spending. if those corridors were widened, acos would have some more breathing room for these inevitable swings, while still working toward better population health and shared savings. caravan health analysis shows that the risk corridors are currently set at a confidence interval of approximately 90 percent. those could be increased (or widened) to 95 percent or higher to create more integrity behind shared savings or losses.\nnrha supports the changes to the benchmarking methodology, but believes it is important to go further to address the problem of regional skew in health care costs. nrha appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acknowledgment of the disproportionate impact of the regional benchmark on rural providers. we are concerned that the current that rural beneficiaries historical underuse of health care due to limited access to care and cultural factors that often lead to low utilization mean financially fragile rural providers could risk the ability to provide services to an underserved population. while nrha is supportive of the use of regional data to rebase historical benchmarks, we believe beneficiaries that are not utilizing services should be excluded from the benchmark. additionally, cms should consider a way to consider the factors leading to low utilization such as a lack of access to care or high levels of undiagnosed chronic disease (as indicated by sociodemographic risk factors) that do not represent the desired effect of the program.\nfurthermore, we are concerned that the proposed remedy, to weight the regional benchmark in inverse proportion to its market share, would not address the poor incentive created by the current calculation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that the better an aco performs, the more it reduces its regional benchmark, effectively reducing the opportunity for future savings. one potential solution would be expanding region size as is done in setting benchmarks for medicare advantage.\nnrha is pleased with the increased flexibility provided in the proposed rule for acos. the proposed beneficiary incentive program is a promising tool for aco participants and we urge cms to maintain flexibility for acos to implement them on a participant level, as appropriate for their area and patient population. while we agree it is helpful for the aco to apply for waiver programs as a collective to ensure the aco board is involved in the required decision-making, participants within an aco often operate in different environments that are not served well by a one-size-fits-all approach. this will be especially true in the case of the beneficiary incentive program where aco participants may want to assign different incentive amounts based upon their region. furthermore, we encourage cms to allow the elimination of patient cost sharing for certain health care services shown to provide high value such as care management services. the aco program highlights the value of annual wellness visits and chronic care management to successfully improving the quality and lowering the cost of care. while these strategies have been shown to yield savings to cms, the administrative hassle of collecting co-payments for chronic care management leads many providers to simply not offer the service. for providers that continue to offer the service, they face the uphill battle of collecting the required co-payment without damaging the patient-provider relationship.\nnrha opposed to the new beneficiary notification requirement proposed by cms. not only is this new requirement extremely burdensome, but this exact type of notification has already been tried by cms in the pioneer aco program and rightly rejected.\ncms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal is particularly confounding in light of the already robust process in place. cms currently requires aco participants to post the aco poster in all their facilities and make the notice to patients available in all primary care settings. these notices are required to be on a cms template, to which cms makes minor changes every year. the hassle of keeping up with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new templates and replacing posters present in every aco facility is already quite burdensome and costly to participants. cms provides no evidence that the posters and notices are not working and proposes to add a third, even more burdensome requirement, without modification of the existing two.\nit is precisely these types of unnecessary hoops that prevent organizations from wanting to engage in acos. additionally, cms offers zero evidence that medicare beneficiaries are not already adequately notified. experience has proven that notifications tend to confuse patients more than anything, creating stigma and actually reducing the provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to effectively manage the care of their patients. cms repeatedly emphasizes that that providers, not patients, participate in the aco, and thus it is unclear that beneficiaries require any additional notification regarding the confusing world of alternative payment models in which their provider is involved.\nall medicare acos are qualified alternative payment models (apms) under the medicare access and chip reauthorization act (macra). what is defined as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore than nominal financial risk\u00e2\u0080\u009d should be defined to include more than just relative gains and losses to the medicare trust fund, but should be instead based on what the provider participating in the aco gains or loses. there are many financial risks that can be far more than nominal that the medicare trust fund approach overlooks, however, including:  start-up costs to get the aco off the ground such as data analysis and establishing procedures for coordinating care and sharing information; ongoing costs for new employees such as care managers; and foregone revenue from billable services that are reduced by the physicians participating in an aco due to use of appropriateness guidelines and efforts to reduce exacerbations of patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 conditions requiring emergency department visits and hospitalizations.\nwhile nrha appreciated cms recognizing the special impacts programs may have on rural providers, we are concerned that the exclusion of rural providers from incentive programs results in no positive payment adjustments. this lack of payment adjustment is another de facto cut to rural providers since medical inflation reduces the value of those payments. while we appreciate the intent behind these exclusions are to spare rural providers the devastating downside risk, we believe the aco program and other incentive programs can and should be modified to allow rural participation. modest modification could allow rural providers to thrive in the programs, as has been seen in the aim program. such program participation is beneficial to both the medicare trust fund and the rural patient population served. small changes such as continuation of the aim funding, ability to remain in the track 1 equivalent program, and changes to the benchmarking methodology will allow rural providers to participate and thrive.\nthank you for the chance to offer comments on this proposed rule, and for your consideration on our comments.  we very much look forward to continuing our work together to ensure our mutual goal of improving quality of and access to care.  if you would like additional information, please contact diane calmus at dcalmus@nrharural.org, or

program,. medicare shared savings program; accountable care \n organizations-pathways to success dear ms. verma: our client, a non-profit hospital system (the \"hospital\"), welcomes this opportunity to comment on the following proposed regulations issued by the centers for medicare and medicaid services (\"cms\") \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \"comments to medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success\" (proposed rule\"), 83 fed. reg. 41786 (august 17, 2018). please find the hospital's comments on the specific cms proposals below.\n1. proposed rule: cms has proposed removing track 1, 1+, 2 and 3 from the mssp and \n the hospital also believes the proposed changes to mssp are antithetical to two key initiatives launched by cms\u00e2\u0080\u0094reducing the regulatory burden on providers and reducing complexity in cms programmatic requirements. specifically, the hospital believes the basic track, where most aco entities will find themselves, creates unnecessary complexity and confusion in comparison to the current, multitrack, configuration of mssp. the method proposed by cms to determine placement within the basic track is laborious and will confuse and frustrate aco entities as to where they will enter and what their progression will be through the basic track.\n2. proposed rule: cms has proposed classifying aco entities by revenue as high revenue \n and other programs is antithetical to cms promises to reduce complexity and provider burden. the hospital feels that the proposed rule will serve to \"sour\" risk-adverse hospitals on entering into alternative payment models (apms\") which would frustrate a key legislative goal of macra. additionally, distinguishing aco entities by revenue, (which predicate most ccn-led acos as high-revenue by their very nature) will only serve to discourage participation by high-revenue aco entities.\n3. proposed rule: cms proposals are based upon analytic comparisons of track 1, track \n 1+, track 2 and track 3 participation and performance. (see proposed rule, p. 41787). hospital comment: the cms' proposed changes to mssp are based upon comparisons between track 1, 1+, 2 and 3 participants. cms references this comparison data throughout the proposed rule as justification for most of the significant proposed changes to the mssp including: the basic and enhanced tracks, limiting the years allowed in upside only payment, and distinguishing acos by revenue and experience. the hospital has several concerns with cms data analysis and assumptions drawn from that analysis. first, cms points to the following statistic as evidence that risk-bearing aco entities perform \"better than\" upside-only aco entities: in 2016, 68% of acos in two-sided models earned shared savings compared to 29% of acos in upside-only tracks. the hospital believes that the use of percentage based comparisons is potentially deceptive and not true indicators of how aco entities, particularly entities which cms proposes to define as high-revenue acos, have performed in track 1. the hospital also does not believe these statistics accurately reflect the success these acos have achieved in curbing costs and protecting the medicare trust funds. the hospital believes the number of acos participating in two-sided models earning shared savings in 2016 was too small to provide statistical significance as only 22 aco entities participated in two-sided models, with 15 earning shared savings. in contrast, the hospital estimates that 29% of track 1 participants (based on the 2017 ssp fact sheet, the total 2016 track 1 enrollment was not provided in the proposed rule) represents over 100 aco entities earned shared savings in 2016 under track 1. this means that almost ten times the number of track 1 aco entities met their cost-savings goals as opposed to two-side risk participants. the hospital has grave concerns about comparative analytics performed on track success with such starkly different n sizes since, numerically, the number of aco entities who met program goals in track 1 eclipses the amount of acos in two-sided risk who did the same. the hospital is also concerned with cms representing statistics as verified trends in performance when the program is very new and the most popular downside risk model, track 1+, is in its first year of participation. the hospital is also concerned by cms' declaration that low-rev acos are earning more shared savings than high- rev acos and believes that cms should release actual dollar savings to medicare by high-rev and low-rev acos to give greater transparency to their data analyses and assumptions made based upon those analyses.\n4. proposed rule: cms has proposed differentiating aco entities as experienced acos or \n savings. although the hospital has serious concerns about inappropriate n size comparisons in other analytics within the rule, the hospital agrees with cms assertion that 43% of track 1 participants being renewing entities in track 1 is evidence that the option for experienced acos to renew into upside-only risk models is retarding the movement of experienced aco entities into two-sided risk arrangements. however, the hospital does not support aco entities being required to participate in the enhanced track due to experience and encourages cms to allow all aco entities to participate in level e of the basic track since that meets the quality payment program's (qpp\") definition of more than nominal risk. the hospital is concerned that cms wishes to accelerate all aco entities into the enhanced track and sees this very high level of risk as unnecessary to achieve significant cost-savings for the medicare trust funds.\n5. proposed rule:  cms has proposed defining an aco entity as reentering if more than \n 50% of aco participants have participated in any aco for the five years preceding the aco's enrollment into the overhauled mssp. (see proposed rule, p. 41788). hospital comment:  the hospital does not support this particular component of the aco entity determination and encourages to cms to consider a slightly different implementation. specifically, the hospital encourages cms to abandon the 50% aco participant determination for aco entities who are deemed completely new, meaning that their legal entity has never sought to enter mssp prior to july 1st, 2019 when cms proposes the new tracks of mssp to begin. the hospital notes to cms that many current aco participants were enrolled in mssp track 1 by affiliated hospitals and often had very little control or knowledge of how the aco entity performed or met cost savings goals. the hospital believes that many of the aco participants who were \"pullee into participation by one hospital aco are also affiliated with other hospitals who are completely inexperienced with mssp participation. deeming these aco participants as experienced because they were drawn into a ccn driven mssp track 1 aco entity, and then potentially having their collective participation cause the new aco to be designated as reentering rather than new, will expose newly formed aco entities to a more aggressive glide path within mssp. the hospital believes this will cause the unintended consequence of very inexperienced acos, particularly high-rev acos, being driven to accept higher levels of risk more quickly than they are actually prepared to handle. this will further discourage \"high-revenue\" legal entities who have no experience with mssp from forming aco entities as their participants might incorrectly define them as a reentering aco. the hospital instead believes that cms should apply the 50% standard to newly formed aco entities where the legal entity has participated in mssp in the past under a different aco entity. this will serve cms' goal of preventing acos from gaming participation rules by forming and reforming aco entities to avoid being categorized as reentering without discouraging truly inexperienced legal entities from forming acos and entering mssp.\n6. proposed rule:  cms has proposed that experienced, low-revenue aco entities will be \n hospital comment:  the hospital has significant reservations about this proposal and encourages cms not to finalize it as proposed. the hospital believes that many low-revenue acos may be looking to partner with high-revenue entities, such as ipps hospitals, in order to have greater control over total part a and b expenditures for their attributed beneficiaries. however, the hospital disagrees that this addition automatically makes the low-revenue acos experience commensurate to that of a high-revenue, experienced aco. the hospital sees the potential that inexperienced high-revenue entities may seek out experienced low-revenue acos and join these entities to capitalize upon the aco entity's experience with success in downside risk. the hospital does not believe that an experienced low-revenue aco with a newly joined, high-revenue inexperienced aco participant, is equitable to a high-revenue, experienced, aco entity and therefore should not be aggressively accelerated to the enhanced track where maximum downside risk is required for participation. instead, the hospital encourages cms to reclassify these aco entities as experienced, but allow them to continue their basic track participation until the end of their participation agreement.\n7. proposed rule:  cms has proposed limiting upside-only participation to the first two \n years of the basic track, to limit reentering and renewing acos to one year of upside only, and to limit renewing, high-rev acos who are deemed experienced to the enhanced track of mssp. (see proposed rule, p. 41833-41834). hospital comment:  the hospital has significant concerns about these proposed changes to mssp listed above and encourages cms not to finalize them as proposed. as cited elsewhere in this rule, the hospital does not agree with cms statement that high-revenue acos are better prepared to aggressively take on higher levels of risk. instead, the hospital believes that creating advantages exclusively for low-revenue acos discourages the formation of new high- revenue acos and encourage disenrollment of existing high-revenue acos from mssp. the hospital encourages cms to consider that with greater medicare ffs revenue comes greater actual dollars at risk and many ccn driven acos may not be positioned to take on risk as aggressively as cms has proposed. the hospital also encourages cms to allow three years of upside-only participation for all basic track participants, regardless of experience or revenue definition. the hospital also respectfully urges cms to reconsider its proposal to require experienced, reentering high-rev acos to enter the revised mssp in the enhanced track. as previously discussed, the hospital is concerned that newly formed aco entities could be misidentified as renewing or reentering experienced acos due to engaging aco participants who were drawn into other aco entities but may not be as risk-experienced as cms believes. the hospital is particularly concerned that aco participants could be discharged from a high-revenue aco entity which elects to dissolve rather than enter the revised mssp program, and then those aco participants could be invited to join a newly forming high-rev aco entity, causing that entity to be deemed both experienced and reentering, although the actual aco entity and aco participants are neither.\n8. proposed rule:  cms has proposed limiting high-revenue acos to one participation \n of experience, revenue designation, or renewing/reentering status. the hospital believes that cms should not aggressively move aco entities to higher risk relationships than the \"more than nominal\" risk standard delineated in the quality payment program and fears that an aggressive glide path like the one proposed by cms will only serve to discourage high-revenue entities from forming acos and entering into the mssp.\n9. proposed rule:  cms has proposed reducing the sharing rate for upside only years within \n the basic track to 25% (no more than 10% of benchmark) as compared to the current sharing rate of 50% within track 1 of mssp. (see proposed rule, p. 41804). hospital comment:  the hospital respectfully disagrees with this proposal and encourages cms not to finalize it as proposed. the dramatic reduction of the sharing rate from 50% to 25% will shock current track 1 participants and encourage mass disenrollment from the mssp. the hospital believes that this reduction will also discourage new, inexperienced aco entities from joining the mssp due to limited return on the significant investment required to spin up an aco entity.\n10. proposed rule:  cms has proposed allowing annual choice in beneficiary assignment \n methodology for all participation levels within the proposed basic and enhanced tracks. (see proposed rule, p. 41790). hospital comment:  the hospital strongly supports cms proposal and encourages cms to finalize it as proposed. the hospital views this allowance as necessary due to statutory language from the bipartisan budget act of 2018 referenced by cms in this proposed rule, and it feels allowing all aco entities to choose from prospective assignment or prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation will serve to increase aco entity interest and participation in the program.\n11. proposed rule:  cms has proposed instituting a claims-based methodology for \n calculating an aco's benchmark based loss sharing limit rather than self-reported as is currently utilized within track 1+. (see proposed rule, p. 41808). hospital comment:  the hospital conditionally supports cms' proposal to institute a claims- based methodology for calculating an aco's benchmark based loss sharing limit and agrees that this will reduce the reporting burden for aco entities. however, the hospital is concerned that cms relied heavily upon track 1+ in its data analysis of this proposed change, and it notes that there are only 55 track 1-f hospitals and the track has existed for only one year. the hospital encourages cms to allow aco entities to self-report their benchmark should they disagree with cms' claims-based benchmark and request cms reconsideration based upon that self-reporting.\n12. proposed rule:  cms has proposed that aco participant ffs revenue include payment \n adjustments made under cms programs such as mips and hvbp. (see proposed rule,\np. 41809). \n programs should negatively affect organizations in a cost-saving model such as mssp. conversely, the hospital does not believe it appropriate to allow penalties to be considered savings as they are generally earned for poor performance in other cms programs.\n13. proposed rule:  cms has proposed allowing basic track participants to \"skip\" to \n higher levels of downside risk within the basic track. (see proposed rule, p. 41810). hospital response:  the hospital strongly supports cms proposal and encourages cms to finalize this flexibility. however, the hospital also encourages cms to allow inexperienced aco entities the option to \"glide backware once in their initial participation in the basic track should they glide upward ahead of schedule and their losses exceed the maximum medicare loss rate for the level they elected to glide to. if cms chose to install this additional flexibility, they could allow no more than 3 years of upside only to prevent \"gaming\" flexibilities to avoid transitioning to higher levels of risk.\n14. proposed rule:  cms has proposed limiting renewals in the basic track to low-revenue \n aco entities. (see proposed rule, p. 41788). hospital response:  the hospital respectfully disagrees with this cms proposal and encourages cms not to finalize it as proposed. while the hospital agrees with cms that renewal options in the current mssp for track i encouraged aco entities to spend inordinate amounts of time in upside-only participation agreements, the hospital believes that there is significant value to aco entities and the medicare trust funds to allow all aco entities to renew participation in level e of the basic track which will move the aco to \"more than nominal\" risk as delineated by qpp and qualify them as an advanced alternative apm participants. the hospital believes that aggressively forcing all aco entities into the enhanced track (track 3 under the current mssp) will scare risk-adverse aco entities away from risk-based relationships and will serve to deter the overall movement to value- based care. it also sets a higher standard for risk than what congress has defined as an advanced alternative payment model under macra which does not serve cms and congress' ultimate goal to have more medicare payments (actual dollar amounts) payed through risk-based models.\n15. proposed rule:  cms has sought comment on whether a glide path should be installed in \n the enhanced track. (see proposed rule, p. 41818). hospital response:  the hospital appreciates cms' request for comment on this proposal, and strongly urges cms to consider installing track 2 of the current mssp as a three year glide path for all aco entities within the proposed enhanced track of mssp.\n16. proposed rule:  cms has alternately proposed to allow higher shared savings (50%) for \n penalizing them with more aggressive participation requirements and an accelerated path to increased risk will dramatically reduce participation by such acos in mssp. the hospital appreciates the opportunity to submit these comments and thanks cms for their consideration. sincerely, .afl5lk o\n\n", "0303": "the honorable seema verma\r\nadministrator\r\ncenters for medicare & medicaid services\r\nu.s. department of health and human services\r\nattention: cms-1701-p, mail stop c4-26-05\r\n7500 security blvd.\r\nbaltimore, md 21244-1850\r\n\r\nre: comments on pathways to success mssp proposed rule\r\n\r\ndear administrator verma,\r\n\r\naugusta care partners is an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as an augusta care partners board member, it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact the office workflow and efficiency of providers in our network. it will be challenging to add yet another regulatory burden to the stack of important documents that patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit patients in our aco and allow augusta care partners providers to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our community.\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nmary n. mannix, fache\r\npresident & ceo\r\naugusta health\r\nboard member\r\n\r\nmary n. mannix, fache\r\npresident & chief executive officer | augusta health\r\np.o. box 1000 | 78 medical center drive | fishersville, va 22939\r\n(540) 932-4819 office | (540) 932-4809 fax\r\nmmannix@augustahealth.com | www.augustahealth.com     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     ", "0304": "please see attached file.\n\n october 16, 2018\n seema verma, administrator centers for medicare & medicaid services, department of health and human services, attention: cms-1701-p,\np.o. box 8013, \n baltimore, md 21244-8016\n re: cms-1701-p - medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations--pathways to success\n dear administrator verma,\n the national association of chain drug stores (nacds) appreciates the opportunity to respond to the centers for medicare and medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) proposed rule \u00e2\u0080\u0093 medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094 pathways to success. our recommendations are intended to support the movement to value \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the inclusion of community-based pharmacies, in new and evolving alternative payment models (apms) that aim to improve quality and outcomes for beneficiaries and reduce costs for the healthcare system.\n nacds represents traditional drug stores, supermarkets and mass merchants with pharmacies. chains operate 40,000 pharmacies, and nacds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nearly 100 chain member companies include regional chains, with a minimum of four stores, and national companies. chains employ nearly 3 million individuals, including 152,000 pharmacists. they fill over 3 billion prescriptions yearly, and help patients use medicines correctly and safely, while offering innovative services that improve patient health and healthcare affordability. the community pharmacy is an accessible, patient-centered healthcare destination that reaches the majority of communities across the united states: nearly 9 out of 10 americans live within 5 miles of a community pharmacy.1 nacds members also include more than 900 supplier partners and over 70 international members representing 20 countries. please visit nacds.org.\n the recommendations we offer in this letter are intended to improve the ability of medicare shared savings program (mssp) accountable care organizations (acos) to coordinate care, improve quality, and reduce the total cost of care by facilitating access to community pharmacy care. our comments focus on four main areas:\n 1) role of pharmacy care in quality improvement and total cost of care; 2) opportunities to integrate community pharmacy care into acos and apms; 3) aligning quality measures across programs and care settings; and, 4) early evidence on the role of pharmacy care in advancing population health and the potential to integrate care into value-based payments.\n 1) role of pharmacy care in advancing value over the last several decades, community pharmacies have evolved into patient-centered healthcare destinations offering a range of accessible and affordable clinical care services including chronic care management and disease state monitoring, smoking cessation programs, transitions of care coordination, minor ailment care, immunization screening and administration, chronic and acute disease screening, mental health services, medication management, health and wellness programs, lifestyle counseling, and more. the needs of a growing medicare population, increased burden from chronic disease, provider shortages and recent projections on the solvency of the medicare trust fund have all increased the urgency to develop new provider collaborations and evolve existing payment models to improve quality and outcomes and reduce costs more quickly.2\n health services research \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and our members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experiences \u00e2\u0080\u0093 illustrate the key role that community pharmacies are already playing in the healthcare continuum. community pharmacists routinely collaborate with other healthcare providers, health systems, and caregivers to positively address patient outcomes and mitigate rising healthcare costs.3 medication adherence is one of the most cited areas where community pharmacies can play a role in improving health outcomes and reducing costs. select studies illustrating the impacts of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and potential from \u00e2\u0080\u0093 improved medication adherence are described below. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 healthcare spending on non-optimal medication therapy (estimated at $528.4 billion per year)4 and medication non-adherence (estimated at $100-290 billion per year and attributed to 10% of hospitalizations)5 could be significantly decreased with the development of more purposeful policies and programs that leverage patient touch points in the community setting and that fully utilize the skillset of community pharmacists. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the pennsylvania project evaluated a pharmacy-based medication adherence initiative across 283 pharmacies. the intervention, which included pharmacist-led screening for medication non-adherence and counseling for those at an increased risk, led to statistically significant improvement in medication adherence for all medication classes that were studied, and an annual per patient cost savings of $241 for improved adherence to oral diabetes medications and $341 related to improved adherence to statin medications.6\n 2 dexter, p., miller, d., clark, d. et al.

(2015). role of pharmacy services in accountable care organizations. journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy. 21(4), 338-344.\n\n the study also examined the hit capabilities needed to manage quality and prescription drug costs. while about half of all acos could e-prescribe, confirm prescription fills, and maintain an active medication list in the ehr, only 10% reported the ability to integrate inpatient and outpatient data (e.g. medication data) from outside the aco in the ehr.18 addressing these data sharing gaps and capabilities are critical to facilitating the sharing of the data that acos, pdps, and pharmacies individually have to improve quality and efficiency and reduce costs. based on the research and our members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experiences we recommend that cms:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 work with community-based pharmacies in addition to acos and standalone pdps to address data sharing barriers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and support the connection of pharmacies to ehrs and other beneficiary records. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 test the impact of reimbursing pharmacy services and recognizing pharmacists as healthcare providers under medicare part b. testing the impact of these policies could be limited to the risk-bearing tracks of the mssp and to those acos that are entering into innovative new business arrangements with standalone pdps.\n we believe this would allow cms to fully assess the impact of better integrating part d drug costs and pharmaceutical management on quality, outcomes, and costs.\n\n 3) aligning quality measures across programs and care settings further, nacds has also examined quality measures under the merit-based incentive payment program (mips) which can be significantly influenced at the community pharmacy point of care \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and their overlap with measures required or included across other medicare programs. a wide range of pharmacy-level metrics are also part of mssp aco measure sets, including: \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedication reconciliation post-discharge\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor diabetes control\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cinfluenza immunization\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdepression utilization of the phq-9\u00e2\u0080\u009d among others. our members have been on the path to quality and value-based payment for several years.  in fact, many are using dashboards to assess their performance on quality measures. we applaud cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to align and refine quality measures across programs and payers through the meaningful measures initiative \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and ask for greater alignment across cms programs, healthcare settings including community pharmacies, and commercial payers. aligned quality measurement will support beneficiaries receiving appropriate care \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and a focus on patient outcomes across the care continuum.\n\n 4) evidence on pharmacies supporting population health and value nacds has a strong commitment to research to understand the role and potential for pharmacy care to advance population health and value-based care. in 2017, nacds\n launched three demonstration projects funded by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) that fostered collaboration across providers, community pharmacies, and immunization registries to increase adult immunization rates. we collaborated with 319 pharmacies across four states to test the delivery of influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, and pertussis vaccines in community pharmacies. researchers were also asked to examine the potential for creating value-based payments to support pharmacy-based immunizations. early results from these demonstrations found that the interventions increased most immunization rates from 2016-2017 with the most consistent increases across all sites seen for influenza (20-45%) and pertussis (13-74%) vaccines.19\n researchers also began to conceptualize how value-based payment models could be structured for community pharmacies. for instance, the university of pittsburgh medical center (upmc) tried to address estimated cost avoidance, vaccine effectiveness, and herd immunity as part of the payment model.20 they formulated a three-tiered model of increasing achievement tied to increasing reward. goals for each tier were defined as percent increases in vaccination rates from the year immediately preceding and incentives were determined as a percentage of direct medical costs avoided to be shared between the payer and provider.21 these research efforts are laying the groundwork for designing more inclusive value-based payment models\u00e2\u0080\u0093 and show the potential for integrating pharmacy care into existing alternative payment models (apms) such as through the mssp.\n while value-based payment models in community pharmacy are still in their early stages, there is significant potential to improve quality and reduce costs from more systematic testing and inclusion. one recent example is wellmark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inclusion of a value-based model, focused on better serving patients with asthma, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and depression in high performing independent and chain pharmacies in iowa and south dakota. goals of this program include ensuring that the patient is on the right drug and is adherent, and in the longer-term, to reduce emergency department visits, hospital readmissions, and total cost of care. while impacts of the wellmark model are too early to assess, it was based on the continuous medication monitoring (comm) pharmacy pilot, which was designed to assess the effects of comm on total costs of care, proportion of days covered (pdc) rates and the use of high-risk medications by elderly patients. the pilot results demonstrated lower total costs of care and meaningfully better medication adherence. per member per month (pmpm) costs were approximately $300 lower for patients who received medications only from the pharmacy offering the comm program as compared to patients receiving medications from other pharmacies. this pilot demonstrated that paying pharmacists to proactively address the safety, effectiveness, and adherence of medications at the time of dispensing can support optimization of medication therapy and decrease costs.22\n in addition, the chart below illustrates the impact of pharmacy care on patient outcomes and related costs:\n author title of article brief description of intervention results\n tran mt, et\nal. \n modeling the cost- effectiveness of a smoking cessation program in a community pharmacy practice the cost effectiveness of a pharmacist- directed smoking cessation program that achieved abstinence of at least 1 year in 25% of patients was studied. depending on the smoker's age at the time of cessation, the incremental discounted cost-effectiveness was $720- 1,418/life-year saved.\n brennan ta, et al. an integrated pharmacy-based program improved medication prescription and adherence rates in diabetes patients pharmacists provided counseling for adherence to diabetes medications and recommendations for other medications often used in tandem with diabetes medications aimed at reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease (ace-inhibitors or arbs and/or statins). patients were identified by a pbm for the intervention. pharmacist-based interventions are effective in improving medication adherence and encouraging patients to start taking medications they need as part of an evidence-based treatment regimen. the return on investment of the initiative was estimated at 3:1. vegter s, et\nal. \n improving adherence to lipid-lowering the pharmaceutical care program, medication monitoring and optimization, was initiated in community pharmacies to focus on lipid-lowering therapy in new patients. the follow-up period was 1 year. patients in the program had a lower risk for discontinuing therapy and in a cohort of 1,000 patients, the intervention resulted in a reduction of 7 nonfatal strokes, 2 fatal strokes, 16 nonfatal heart attacks, 7 fatal heart attacks, and 16 revascularizations over patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lifetimes. the intervention also produced considerable net cost savings.\n spence mm, et al. evaluation of an outpatient pharmacy clinical services program on adherence and clinical outcomes among patients with diabetes and/or coronary artery disease an outpatient pharmacy clinical service program targeted nonadherent diabetes mellitus and/or coronary artery disease patients with hemoglobin a1c and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol outside clinical goals. patients who received the outpatient pharmacy clinical service program were more likely to be adherent with their diabetes medications (53.5% compared to 37.4%). this group was also more likely to continue taking their medication, less likely to have an emergency department visit, and the return on investment for this program was estimated at 5.79:1.\n lee jk, et al. effect of a pharmacy care program on medication adherence, blood pressure, and low- density lipoprotein cholesterol: a randomized trial comprehensive pharmacy care program for elderly patients aged 65 years and older with coronary risk factors to improve medication adherence and its associated effects on blood pressure (bp) and ldl levels pharmacy care program led to increases in medication adherence, medication persistence, and clinically meaningful reductions in bp. after 6 months of intervention, medication adherence increased from baseline of 61.2% to 96.9% and associated with significant improvements in systolic bp (133.2 to\n129.9) and ldl-c levels (91.7 to 86.8). \n van boven jf, et al. medication monitoring and optimization: a targeted pharmacist program for effective and cost- effective improvement of chronic therapy adherence medication monitoring and optimization (memo) program is a platform for monitoring and improving therapy adherence through facilitation of targeted and continuous patient- centered pharmaceutical care around chronic medications. for osteoporosis, therapy discontinuation after 1 year was\n16.1% in the memo patients, \n compared with 31.7% in the control patients. for dyslipidemia, the therapy discontinuation rate was 13.6% in the memo cohort and 25.9% in the control group. the cost- effective aspect was favorable for the primary prevention population and significant for the secondary prevention population (lower costs and more health gains).\n klepser dg, et al. cost-effectiveness of pharmacist- provided treatment of adult pharyngitis community pharmacists used a rapid antigen detection test for strep throat and provided medication for positive results during the research project. the cost associated with providing the treatment was compared to 5 physician-provided treatment strategies for strep throat. pharmacist treatment of strep throat was the most cost effective.\n cranor cw, et al. the asheville project: short- term outcomes of a community pharmacy diabetes care program. patients scheduled consultations with pharmacists over 7-9 months. during the appointments, pharmacists provided counseling and education, training on the use of blood glucose monitors, and clinical assessment of the patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 diabetes including monitoring, follow-up, and referral. patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a1c measurements (a 3- month assessment of blood sugar) were significantly reduced. researchers observed a 16% decrease in all-diagnosis costs.\n\n conclusion we thank cms for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule. if you have any questions or would like to discuss our recommendations further, please contact us.\n\n\n tom o\u00e2\u0080\u0099donnell svp, government affairs & public policy nacds\n\n", "0305": "as you know, under the current medicare shared savings program (mssp) beneficiary assignment regulations, an np is an authorized aco professional, but their patients cannot be assigned to the aco unless they receive one primary care service from a primary care physician participating with the aco each year. this has inhibited np practices from joining or establishing shared savings aco's and limited the scope of the shared savings program (mssp). if the mssp is to continue to develop and improve patient access, quality and cost effectiveness, it must be fully inclusive of nps and their patients.\r\n\r\ntherefore, i support cms' proposal to update the voluntary alignment option for beneficiary assignment in the shared savings program (mssp). this proposal would allow a patient to choose an np as their primary shared savings aco clinician and be assigned to an mssp aco without requiring a primary care service from a primary care physician. this proposal will increase the participation of nps and their patients in the mssp and is consistent with a patient-centered approach to health

accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our community.\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nj. scott just, md mba facep\r\npresident,\r\naugusta

success\n dear administrator verma,\n on behalf of blue cross blue shield of massachusetts (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbcbsma\u00e2\u0080\u009d), thank you for the opportunity to provide our comments in response to the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) notice of proposed rulemaking for the medicare shared savings program (mssp). bcbsma is one of 36 independent, community-based, and locally operated blue cross and blue shield plans that collectively provide health care coverage for more than 100 million \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one in three \u00e2\u0080\u0093 americans.\n at bcbsma, our highest priority is making quality health care affordable for individuals, families and employers who have made us the health plan of choice in massachusetts. founded in 1937, bcbsma is the leading private health plan in the commonwealth\u00e2\u0080\u0094a not-for-profit company with a proud history of community and health care leadership.\n we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughtful consideration of how various aspects of the mssp could be improved to maximize overall program performance and ultimately improve the affordability and quality of care for medicare beneficiaries. our specific comments are focused on the proposed redesign of the mssp participation options, the agreement period, and benchmarking methodology:\n sided risk in the mssp, and we also know from the 2017 mssp results confirm that aco performance improves with longer participation in the program.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 providing an appropriate window for successful acos to continue in the program and achieve a reasonable return on their investment will encourage broader upfront adoption, incentivize better performance, and encourage greater long-term returns by retaining high performers. as currently drafted, however, we question whether certain provisions within the proposed rule could instead lead to more departures of existing acos or decisions not to participate in the program.\n o we believe that the incentives to initially engage in or to more aggressively take on two-sided risk should be appropriately measured to encourage voluntary entry and to ensure continued transitions to enhanced risk. in particular, the proposed modification to shorten the time period (from 6 to 2 years) in which a provider must take on two-sided risk may be too aggressive. a sufficient glide path is key to encouraging organizations to embark on the journey of delivery system transformation and turn away from the traditional fee-for-service (ffs) incentive to drive volume.\n o there are significant investments required in the early phase of the mssp, and the proposed modification to reduce the sharing rate for providers in the one- sided model by 50 percent compared to its current level is not likely to provide the necessary return on investment to encourage entry into the program.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 we agree with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to modify agreement periods from 3 years to 5 years, which we believe can create more stability in the program, and demonstrates a commitment to the program and true delivery system transformation.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 we agree that moving toward regional benchmarks is an important goal and would provide additional symmetry with the medicare advantage (ma) program. however, cms must proceed in a way that preserves and encourages participation by the high- spending providers in what is a voluntary program. moving to regional-adjusted benchmarks too quickly will discourage participation by high-spending providers; if only the lower spending providers remain, cms will not only lose the opportunity to realize savings from the high-spending providers, but it will subsidize the already low-spending providers who are inherently below the regionally-adjusted benchmarks.\n members through mssp contracts, i wanted to share more about our extensive experience in developing commercial value-based arrangements.\n in this effort, blue cross blue shield of massachusetts developed the alternative quality contract (aqc) in 2007, an innovative global two-sided risk payment model that combines a population-based budget (adjusted annually for health status and inflation) based on historical levels of health care expenditures and covers all inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, behavioral health, and other health services bcbsma patients require -- with substantial performance incentive payments tied to the latest nationally accepted measures of quality, outcomes, and patient experience. the aqc arrangement is a 5-year agreement that encourages providers to invest in long-term, lasting improvement initiatives.\n in addition to the global budget, with symmetrical 2-sided risk, the aqc includes a significant earning opportunity based on quality.   the quality measure encompasses ambulatory and hospital care and includes measures of clinical process, clinical outcomes and patient care experiences.   the quality score is used to both determine the aqc organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality incentive payment and also determines the amount of shared savings or losses that the provider receives \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with a higher quality score driving a higher share of savings and a lower share of losses.   in these ways, the quality measure set serves as an important backstop against any impulse to underuse services that may arise in the context of a budget constraint. further, bcbsma sets the quality measure targets at the beginning of the multi-year contract and does not change them over the contract term \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thereby allowing provider system to plan its quality improvement agenda for the contract period.   one of the areas providers struggle with in cms aco programs is the ever-moving target on quality, as benchmark targets change annually.\n the aqc now includes approximately 90 percent of the physicians in the blue cross hmo network in massachusetts, making it the predominant contract model between blue cross and its network physicians and hospitals. an october 2014 study in the new england journal of medicine shows that the aqc has improved the quality of patient care and lowered costs in the 4 years since it was first implemented \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with achieved savings accelerated year by year. we are also especially proud of the results that focused on chronic conditions. we would be happy to share with you more details of our aqc model, and more generally our experience in risk- bearing contracting as cms considers the aspects of the mssp.\n thank you for the opportunity to comment on these important issues pertaining to the proposed changes to medicare shared savings program and our own experiences with value- based contracting. we appreciate your commitment to addressing and finding solutions to current challenges to health care quality, access, and affordability and we look forward to continuing to work you.\n\n\n\n\n if you have any questions, please see my contact information below.\n sincerely,\n deirdre w. savage vice president blue cross blue shield of massachusetts 617-246-3359

medicare shared savings program (mssp) proposed rule\n differentiation of participation options for high- and low-revenue accountable care organizations (acos)\n in order to provide acos with \u00e2\u0080\u009cpathways to success\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the mssp, cms proposes to redesign the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation options. specifically, the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) would discontinue tracks 1 and 2 and the deferred renewal option. instead, it would offer two tracks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 basic and enhanced \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that eligible acos could enter for an agreement period of not less than five years. the basic track would include a glide path to risk consisting of five levels, but only certain acos would be permitted to enter the program at the start of the glide path with upside-only risk. the enhanced track would mirror the current track 3.\n cms proposes additional policies to distinguish among acos and restrict some acos to only certain participation options. one such proposed distinction is between what cms has termed \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh-revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos. to define low- and high-revenue acos, the agency would assess the degree of control an aco holds over the medicare expenditures of its assigned beneficiaries in terms of how much of its beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 revenue it \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaptures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d specifically, if an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medicare part a and b fee-for-service (ffs) revenue is 25 percent or more of the total medicare part a and b ffs expenditures for its assigned beneficiaries, cms would consider that aco \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh- revenue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d in addition, cms proposes to differentiate between \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos, based on acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 prior experience in \u00e2\u0080\u009cperformance-based\u00e2\u0080\u009d (or two- sided) risk medicare acos.\n cms proposes to limit high-revenue acos, which the agency states are often hospital- led, to a single agreement period in the basic track. conversely, it proposes to allow low-revenue acos to participate in two agreement periods in the basic track. additionally, cms proposes to prohibit experienced, high-revenue acos from entering the basic track at any level, and would instead limit them to immediate participation in the proposed enhanced track. cms would allow experienced, low-revenue acos to participate in level e of the basic track for up to two agreement periods before requiring them to transition to the enhanced track. cms also considers and seeks comments on proposals to allow low-revenue acos to have potentially greater access to shared savings than high-revenue acos.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 5 of 25\n\n degree of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control over its assigned beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 medicare expenditures indicates that it is able to take on more risk, more quickly. as such, we urge cms not to finalize any proposals that differentiate between high- and low-revenue acos, or between acos with and without hospital participation, at this time. such proposals are unwarranted and could have negative effects on patient care, as well as cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to transition our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care system to one that pays for value instead of volume. in short:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the bifurcation of participation options for high- and low-revenue acos creates an un-level playing field based on faulty and incomplete definitions, assumptions and data; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 risk readiness is not determined by aco composition; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the proposal fails to empower acos to maximize their contribution to patient care and is a distraction from the goals of acos and cms.\n the bifurcation of participation options for high- and low-revenue acos creates an un-level playing field based on faulty and incomplete definitions, assumptions and data. cms bases its proposal to differentiate between high- and low-revenue acos on incomplete and misguided data that suggest \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos outperform \u00e2\u0080\u009chospital- led\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos, as well as its assumption that high-revenue acos are likely to include hospitals, health systems, and/or other institutional providers. however, the results of the aco program cannot be explained simply by dividing the world into high- and low-revenue or hospital- and physician-led. as such, cms should not base such significant changes to the mssp on these distinctions. this is especially true given that, in 2017, only approximately one third of acos achieved any shared savings at all.1 any generalizations about which acos are more successful than others would not advance the goals of the mssp to improve the quality of patient care and reduce costs.\n under the mssp as it currently stands, cms defines an aco as \u00e2\u0080\u009chospital-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d only if it includes an inpatient taxpayer identification number (tin) on the participant list it submits to cms. this definition misrepresents the wide range of hospitals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 involvement in acos, including:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 jointly initiating and leading an aco with a physician group; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 participating in the aco contract without a leadership role; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 contracting with a physician group for health system services and resources without appearing on the physician group aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participant list; or \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 participating in another manner.\n for example, an academic medical center might have an aco that is run through its faculty practice; cms would call this aco \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d despite the obviously critical\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 6 of 25\n\n role the academic medical center would play in providing care to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patients. as another example, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d aco may be truly led by an investor, which would not be reflected in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participant list. indeed, cms itself recognizes this fallacy of relying on participant lists when it indicated that to move from being a high- to low-revenue aco, an aco could simply remove a hospital from its participant list but make no other changes to its care delivery.\n this is even more troubling considering the vagueness with which the specifics of the proposal are presented in the rule. for example, cms neither sufficiently explains the basis for its proposed threshold of 25 percent to identify high-revenue acos, nor provides any indication of which current acos would be considered high- or low- revenue. the agency does not even provide acos with the tools to run a calculation themselves to determine whether they are high- or low-revenue and, in fact, recognizes it would be difficult for acos to do so. cms indicates in the rule that it would inform an aco of whether it is high- or low-revenue only after it has submitted its application for participation in the mssp. however, by that point, acos and their participants would have already had to make several critical participation decisions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all with woefully inadequate information. this is especially true for existing acos that have already experienced the long lag time between when they complete their performance years and when they receive their performance data from cms, as well as fluctuations in their lists of assigned beneficiaries, or those that do not have a team of actuaries that can run necessary calculations for them. if the rule is finalized as proposed, this lack of transparency and resources from cms would leave acos having to make uninformed decisions about a full five years of participation. we strongly recommend cms release data on which it based these and all other proposals and provide acos with significantly more tools and resources to run calculations themselves.\n differentiation between high- and low-revenue acos based on flawed data. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed differentiation of high- and low-revenue acos is based on misleading definitions and inaccurate data regarding the performance of physician- and hospital-led acos. while some differentiation between participants may be appropriate, favoring a certain provider type or aco size over another simply incentivizes physicians and hospitals to distrust one another rather than improve care coordination. cms cannot effectuate sustainable change in care delivery without having all providers of care at the same table.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 7 of 25\n\n of the success of an aco as it fails to account for not only methodological issues with setting the benchmarks but also the spillover effect on patients who are not participating in an aco that nonetheless benefit from its integrated care networks, care coordination and other operational infrastructure.\n in fact, a methodology that calculates how much shared savings was earned against a benchmark depends equally, if not more, on the benchmark itself (and the market context in which it is set) than on the efforts of the aco. two acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 regardless of whether or not a hospital participates in them \u00e2\u0080\u0093 could be performing exactly the same but have completely different results because their benchmarks are different. no aco can decline its expenses as quickly as its benchmark declines, which means that no matter how well an aco may perform, it still may fail to earn shared savings. cms may not even be able to explain the degree of change in an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark: one of our members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 acos saw its benchmark decline by $1000 in a single rebasing and no one, including cms, could explain why.\n the interrelationship between cms programs can also impact shared savings calculations. for example, the physicians of some of our members participating in acos also participate in the comprehensive primary care plus (cpc+) program, through which participants receive upfront care management fees. in the mssp, the millions of dollars that these acos spent in care coordination, which included those care management fees, were counted as an expense of the acos, impacting their benchmarks. in addition, two of our member hospitals that participate in one of these acos also began participation in the bundled payments for care improvement (bpci) advanced initiative earlier this month; any savings generated from patients that are assigned to the aco that trigger a bpci advanced episode will be attributed to the hospital as a bpci advanced participant, not the aco.\n other studies performed by external researchers that rely on cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitions of hospital- and physician-led also misstate the difference in savings between the two groups. for example, in a study published in the new england journal of medicine on sept. 5, 2018, the authors conclude that physician groups that participated in acos saved money for medicare \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhereas hospital-integrated acos did not produce savings (on average) during the same period.\u00e2\u0080\u009d2 however, a closer analysis of the results in the study, using the authors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 own methodology of finding significance at the 5 percent level, demonstrates that their conclusion is not supported. the authors base their conclusion on their comparison of the performance of physician-led and hospital-led acos over eight years (years one, two and three of the cohort that entered the aco program in 2012, years one, two and three of the 2013 cohort and years one and two of the 2014 cohort). however, in only two of those eight years were the differences in savings between physician-led and hospital-led acos statistically significant. therefore, even though they used different methodologies, both cms and other researchers have\n\n2 j. michael mcwilliams, et al., medicare spending after 3 years of the medicare shared savings \n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 8 of 25\n\n significantly overstated the degree to which the performance of hospital-led acos differs from that of physician-led acos. cms should not base a major redesign of the mssp participation options on a single methodological approach nor on data that lack clarity and conclusiveness.\n moreover, when using more appropriate definitions of aco composition, our analysis revealed that acos with hospital participation actually saved more for the medicare trust fund than those without hospital participation. specifically, we analyzed cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list of the 472 acos that participated in the mssp in 2017 and deemed acos with any hospital participation as \u00e2\u0080\u009chospital-affiliated\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos. this methodology captures the important contributions that hospitals make to the care of aco beneficiaries, regardless of whether they are listed on acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 participant lists. our analysis found that nearly 20 percent of the acos that cms would characterize as physician-led, in fact, have affiliated hospitals contributing to the care of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries. and, our analysis demonstrates that, in 2017, hospital-affiliated acos saved a total of approximately $174 million, while non-hospital-affiliated acos saved a total of approximately $140 million.3 these numbers stand in stark contrast to the calculation of savings using cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitions of aco leadership; those definitions suggest hospital-led acos saved a total of approximately of $72 million and other acos saved a total of approximately $241 million in 2017. clearly, hospitals have made significant contributions to the savings to the medicare program that acos have achieved and should not be treated otherwise. thus, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed revisions to the mssp that rely on results suggesting \u00e2\u0080\u009chospital-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos underperform as compared with \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos are misguided and based upon inaccurate definitions of these acos and inconclusive evidence about their performance.\n we conducted additional analysis to demonstrate that small changes in definitions can lead to large variations in results. for example, if we define \u00e2\u0080\u009csmall\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos as those with fewer than 10,000 beneficiaries and those with 10,000 or more beneficiaries as \u00e2\u0080\u009clarge\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos, our data indicates that larger acos save significantly more than smaller acos, both in the aggregate and in per beneficiary savings. however, when we compare acos with fewer than 25,000 assigned beneficiaries (\u00e2\u0080\u009csmall\u00e2\u0080\u009d) to those with greater than 25,000 beneficiaries (\u00e2\u0080\u009clarge\u00e2\u0080\u009d), the opposite is true.4 perhaps these data also suggests that the larger an aco is, as defined by number of assigned beneficiaries, the harder it is to achieve shared savings. large acos must manage risk for a greater number of beneficiaries and bring together what is likely a higher number of providers in agreement on how to manage this risk. due to the magnitude of the total cost of care for these acos, prematurely forcing them to take on even a small percentage of risk could result in shared losses that nearly swallow their entire operating margins. we urge cms\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 9 of 25\n\n to seek ways to support these acos, rather than make it harder for them to achieve savings.\n importance of quality improvement to success in the mssp. in its heightened focus on achieving savings, cms overlooks the significant improvements in patient experiences, outcomes and quality of care that all providers have achieved through aco participation. excluding these achievements from the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009csuccess\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the mssp would render any such definitions incomplete and ill-suited to form the basis of significant program change. in our analysis, acos had an average quality score of approximately 92.4 percent in 2017, with a negligible difference between the scores of hospital-affiliated acos and acos without hospital affiliation. this delivery of high-quality health care across providers should be as important to medicare as the achievement of shared savings.\n given that managing hospital care is a key component of improving outcomes and reducing cost growth, hospitals are in an ideal position to contribute to the quality of care that acos deliver. by engaging providers across the care continuum, managing the coordination of care transitions, and driving data sharing within and among provider settings, hospitals play a vital role in improving the quality of care for aco and other beneficiaries. what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, these quality improvements often produce a reduction in health care costs, and thus should be efforts that cms seeks to support. for example, with hospital participation, an aco could more carefully manage transitions out of the hospital to minimize post-hospital care and reduce readmissions, improving patient outcomes and reducing costs.\n risk readiness is not determined by aco composition. using the level of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaptured\u00e2\u0080\u009d revenue as a proxy for the leadership composition of an aco belies the true nature of care delivery in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environment. there is no valid reason to conclude that an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaptured\u00e2\u0080\u009d revenue is an accurate or appropriate predictor of either the amount of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontrol\u00e2\u0080\u009d it has over its beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expenditures or its level of risk preparedness.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 10 of 25\n\n disabilities, end-stage renal disease, and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).5 these individuals also are more likely to have been previously cared for in an emergency department, thereby having higher medicare spending both prior to and during the receipt of ambulatory care. no matter how efficiently hospitals operate, they still have to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and do \u00e2\u0080\u0093 provide complete and medically appropriate care to these more complex individuals.\n similarly, the significant rise in medicare drug spending results in more medicare dollars being paid to hospitals for beneficiaries in its care. however, it does not indicate \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontrol.\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to our research, from 2015 through 2016, medicare spending on all medicare part b separately payable drugs increased more than 7 percent. approximately 96 percent of the growth was due to increases in drug prices and 4 percent was due to increased utilization. during the same time period, spending on outpatient separately payable drugs grew by approximately 11 percent. the price of outpatient separately payable drugs grew at an even higher rate of about 11.28 percent; thus, over 100 percent of the growth during this time was attributable to price increases of outpatient separately payable drugs. the utilization of these drugs decreased over the same period of time. the increase in drug spending from 2015 to 2016 represents about $1 billion in additional spending compared to if no change in price had occurred.\n control does not predict risk preparedness. cms offers no convincing argument to support its assumption that an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontrol\u00e2\u0080\u009d over the medicare expenditures for its assigned beneficiaries indicates that it is more prepared to take on more risk, more quickly, with less experience. indeed, researchers and aco participants are still working to determine what, in fact, does prepare an aco to take on risk. in the experience of our members, some factors that determined their own risk preparedness included:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 tight coordination between hospitals and post-acute providers; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 interdisciplinary management of the aco; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 robust care management in inpatient and outpatient settings; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 significant investment in infrastructure to close gaps in care transitions and coordination; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 investment in data analysis and reporting systems to better target the care each population receives; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 system-wide incentives to manage the total cost of care.\n the amount of time an aco spends in an accountable care arrangement is also a well- documented contributor to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to take on risk and share in savings.6 the risk\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 11 of 25\n\n preparedness of mssp acos also may be influenced by the accountable care contracts with other payers in which the aco participates.7 we urge cms to focus its attention on determining accurate predictors for risk preparedness and revise elements of the mssp based on those factors.\n proposal fails to empower acos to maximize their contribution to patient care and distracts from acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals. making participation more challenging for acos that would be high-revenue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 i.e., those with hospital affiliation, among others \u00e2\u0080\u0093 would marginalize these participants. we are concerned that this could lead to their departure and would squander the significant investments they have made in care coordination and data-sharing before they were able to pay off for the medicare program and its beneficiaries.\n while cms suggests that providers are \u00e2\u0080\u009cwaiting in the wings\u00e2\u0080\u009d to sign up for accountable care, in 2018, only 11.8 percent of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hospitals were participating in the mssp.8 if hospital participation falls \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as cms in fact expects it will \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it would be to the detriment of both patients and the medicare program because they would lose the important contributions of acos that include hospital participants. even under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s methodology, which systematically underestimates shared savings, net program savings were approximately $313 million in performance year 2017. using the more precise methodology of measuring savings against spending that would have occurred had acos not existed reveals the mssp achieved net savings in performance years 2013-2015 of approximately $542 million. in addition, by using new and stronger partnerships across the care continuum to excel on quality measures, hospitals participating in acos also may have impacted the relative quality scores of non- participating hospitals. should hospitals decline to participate in the mssp moving forward, these spillover effects also would disappear.\n we also are concerned that cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal essentially communicates to hospital-led acos that, although they invested more in their programs, they will, nonetheless, face higher hurdles in order to recoup any of it. such a message is a counterintuitive one to send, especially to the hospitals that were early adopters of risk and most prepared to demonstrate that the aco program works. for example, one of our members spent $1.4 million to set up its aco in 2015. it spends an additional $500,000 per year on annual maintenance of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two electronic medical record systems and $1.2 million per year to provide health coaching to beneficiaries on site and via telehealth. this brings its total investment to date to $6.5 million. and, even this aco relied on donated staff time from an even larger health system that helps run the\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 12 of 25\n\n\naco. we would expect that larger acos with multiple hospitals, hundreds of providers, \n and thousands of beds, would spend in the tens of millions to set up their acos and separately, in annual costs to maintain their acos.9\n without hospital participation, the mssp could be left with small pockets of healthy beneficiaries and an overall shift of the medicare program back to siloed operation. but where would this leave the troves of sicker and more complex patients that require hospital care? those beneficiaries would receive primary care in physicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offices, but be sent outside the aco for hospital-based care, likely facing interruptions in care transitions and delays in receiving care as they attempt to navigate the continuum of care on their own. non-aco beneficiaries that receive care in the hospital also would lose the benefit of the spillover effects that result from a hospital redesigning care pathways as part of its aco participation. such a result hardly accelerates the system- wide transition to value-based care that cms is so eager to effectuate.\n instead of making it harder for acos with hospital participants to achieve shared savings, and adding complexity to the mssp with arbitrary distinctions, we urge cms to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfloat all boats\u00e2\u0080\u009d by improving program methodology so that it accurately rewards performance for improving quality and reducing costs. we also urge the agency to offer resources and assistance to all aco participants that are working to redesign care delivery to improve the health of patients. indeed, the experience of acos in other models suggests upfront support increases the likelihood of acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 success. for example, acos in the aco investment model (aim), which was created to help rural providers in the mssp, received $58 million in loans from cms, much of it upfront, and achieved $82 million in net program savings in their first year.\n in addition, we urge cms to conduct in-depth studies of what other practices contribute to success in the mssp, such as infrastructure arrangements and workforce competencies. this information will be essential as cms increasingly expects providers to address community and population health. as acos continue to lead the field in testing out this type of care, we recommend cms encourage their learning efforts and provide them with adequate time and resources to make the changes they find are necessary.\n the aha stands ready to work with cms to identify which program methodologies would enable acos to prepare for risk, achieve shared savings and improve patient outcomes. acos are building momentum and determining the best ways to manage their patient populations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 total cost of care. stability and clarity in the aco program could go a long way in empowering them to do so.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 13 of 25\n\n differentiation of participation options for inexperienced and experienced acos\n in addition to differentiating between high- and low-revenue acos, cms proposes to differentiate between \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos in terms of prior participation with performance-based risk. it would make different participation options available to each group. specifically, cms would identify an aco as experienced with performance-based risk medicare aco initiatives as those that meet either of the following criteria:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the aco is the same legal entity as a current or previous aco that is participating in, or has participated in, a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under a two-sided model; or \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 forty percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or in an aco that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under a two-sided model, in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n as proposed, experienced acos would be required to enter the new mssp at the highest levels of risk (level e of the basic track for low-revenue acos and the enhanced track for high-revenue acos). thus, up to 60 percent of participants in a given aco could be prohibited from entering the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path based on the experience of as few as 40 percent of their co-participants. cms states that this proposal is intended to ensure that acos with \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant\u00e2\u0080\u009d experience with performance-based risk are \u00e2\u0080\u009cappropriately placed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d but in its own example, cms envisions an aco where 20 percent of participants have experience in track 3 and another 20 in the next generation aco model. this situation hardly represents cohesive and consistent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not to mention significant \u00e2\u0080\u0093 experience with a single set of aco methodologies such that it should drive participation options for all 100 percent of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants. therefore, we recommend cms define an \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d aco as one in which at least the majority of aco participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or in an aco that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under a two-sided model, in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 14 of 25\n\n identifying \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos to require that a majority of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in the same performance-based risk medicare aco initiative.\n reduction of time in upside-only risk arrangements\n under the rule, new, inexperienced acos would receive two-and-a-half years in upside- only risk arrangements for agreement periods beginning july 1, 2019, and two years for agreement periods beginning at a later date. inexperienced re-entering or renewing acos would receive a maximum of one-and-a-half years and one year, respectively. experienced acos, as noted above, would be immediately required to take on risk.\n the aha greatly appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow inexperienced re-entering and renewing acos, which include those that are currently participating in track 1 of the mssp, an additional year of upside-only risk. this would allow these acos to gain experience and familiarity with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed changes to the mssp, such as changes to benchmarking and risk adjustment, better preparing them to take on risk in a redesigned mssp. the aha also supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow acos to voluntarily assume more risk and move out of the upside-only levels as they feel prepared to do\nso. \n\n however, we have serious concerns about limiting of new, inexperienced acos to two years in upside-only arrangements. the timing of benchmark notification, data receipt and shared savings determinations under the program render such a short period of time effectively useless to determine if the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care coordination and other redesigns are having the intended effect. in other words, these acos are functionally blind to their financial performance for the entire length of a performance year and into the following year. at a time when aco participants need to determine how to invest any returns or how to alter their care delivery to achieve savings and improve quality, they have no visibility into whether they even have any returns to invest or whether changes they have already made have produced cost reductions or quality gains.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 15 of 25\n\n this proposal would force acos to take on risk without much-needed information, setting many up for failure.\n taking on risk this quickly could be especially difficult for rural providers with low patient volumes and could imperil their ability to participate in the merit based incentive payments system (mips), another vitally important cms value program. participation in any of the current mssp tracks qualifies clinicians and groups to use the mips apm scoring standard in which clinician or group quality and improvement activity scores are tied to their aco. rural providers join acos to contribute to the overall health of their communities, but as non-aco clinicians or groups, they would lack sufficient medicare part b patients or charges to surpass the mips low-volume threshold. without the ability to report mips measures via the mips-apm scoring standard, these acos would likely cease to report mips measures altogether.\n in addition, contrary to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belief that an upside-only track may be encouraging consolidation in the marketplace, we are concerned that the proposal to shorten the time acos can spend in upside-only arrangements would result in the consolidation or departure of acos, especially smaller acos, which do not feel prepared to take on risk after two performance years and one year of performance data. acos allow providers to collaborate without merging to achieve the scale necessary to engage in value-based care. thus, providers can form and join acos to access many benefits they otherwise might have merged to obtain. upside-only acos specifically allow providers that lack the size and sophistication to manage downside risk to engage in value-based care. shortening the time that acos can engage in upside-only arrangements would discourage smaller providers that cannot bear downside risk from joining acos. this would likely lead to more provider consolidation, as some providers may choose to merge with or join an organization that can manage the downside risk in order to access value-based care contracts. and, moving acos to downside risk before they are ready may cause them to perform poorly, which can put small providers out of business or force them to merge or consolidate to survive.\n we recommend that cms allow new, inexperienced acos three years in upside- only risk before requiring them to take on downside risk, but maintain the opportunity for acos that feel ready to elect to move into downside risk prior to completing three performance years. indeed, our recommended three-year upside- only term is supported by aco performance data itself. for example, it is well documented that the longer acos remain in the program, the more likely they are to achieve shared savings.10 evidence demonstrates that per beneficiary savings correlate to experience, especially after acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 third year in the mssp.11 in the experience of one\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 16 of 25\n\n of our members, whose $6.5 million investment to set-up and run its acos for its first three performance years is described above, it took three years to achieve any savings. this aco was only able to achieve savings by making regular adjustments to its care delivery as it learned more and more about its beneficiaries over all three years. and, when the aco did earn savings, it earned $2.1 million, not even a third of their initial investment. if this and other acos had had to take on risk before that crucial third year, they may have declined to participate in the mssp at the outset.\n we also believe that allowing acos to remain in upside-only risk arrangements for a longer period of time would result in more \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not less \u00e2\u0080\u0093 savings to the medicare program. contrary to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assertion in the rule that \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo-sided models perform better over time than one-sided model acos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the 2017 results of the mssp demonstrate that upside-only acos achieved 93 percent of the mssp savings to medicare. it is clear that it takes time to achieve shared savings, and spending a meaningful amount of that time in upside-only risk may actually increase, not decrease, the likelihood of achieving savings.\n levels of risk and reward\n reduction of shared savings rates for acos in upside-only risk arrangements. as part of its glide path to risk, cms proposes to gradually increase the shared savings that acos can achieve. the savings rate would be 25 percent in the upside-only levels, level a and level b. it would gradually increase to 50 percent in level e. however, this is a marked decline from the current up-side only savings rate of 50 percent in track 1 if acos meet certain cost and quality targets. in addition, as figure 1 below illustrates, once cms makes all the calculations that go into determining a shared savings bonus payment, the 50 percent savings rate ends up yielding much less. in this example, the hypothetical \u00e2\u0080\u009camerican aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d has 60,000 medicare beneficiaries and saved $300 per beneficiary, or $18 million in total. of the $18 million saved, cms would keep $10.8 million or 60 percent, and the aco would receive $7.2 million, or 40 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 17 of 25\n\n figure 1 begin here how an aco bonus payment is calculated (track 1, year 2)\n $10,000 per capita benchmark $9,800 per capita minimum savings rate (msr) (2%)\n $9,700 per capita actual spending american aco has 60,000 beneficiaries $300 savings/beneficiary up to 50/50 shared with cms based on quality score quality score = 80% calculate shared savings quality score (80%) x (50% shared savings) = 40% ($300 per beneficiary) x 40% = $120/beneficiary to aco cms receives $300/bene x 60%) = $180/bene cms shared savings bonus ($180/bene) x (60,000 benes) = $10,800,000 aco receives ($120/bene) x (60,000 benes) = $7,200,000\n\n\n in this example, with a 25 percent shared savings rate american aco would receive\n$3.6 million of the $18 million it saved, or 20 percent, and cms would keep $14.4 \n million. reducing the shared savings rate from 50 percent to 25 percent for upside-only acos would result in such low shared savings payments to acos that participation in the program would not be worthwhile for many of them. this is particularly true given the start-up and ongoing annual operational costs of participation, as described above, as well as other program features for which acos carry all of the risk. if acos receive far lower shared savings payments, they will have less capital to invest in caring for their beneficiaries, thereby reducing the potential for future savings to medicare. inexperienced re-entering and renewing acos that established their acos on the expectation that they would share in 50 percent of any savings they achieved and those that have already achieved some savings would face a significant cut to any savings they achieve in the future. we expect some of these acos would exit the program rather than put into care redesign the same amount of work for significantly less potential reward.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 18 of 25\n\n to address these issues, we recommend cms maintain a 50 percent shared savings rate for not only upside-only acos, but also for all levels under the basic track. we also recommend cms continue to allow acos to share in first-dollar savings once the minimum savings rate (msr) is exceeded. additionally, we recommend cms treat the achievement of quality scores as something that deserves reward rather than only something that can reduce shared savings. specifically, we urge cms to use an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality score to award additional shared savings up to a maximum sharing rate of 80 percent for upside-only acos and 90 percent for acos under two-sided risk. currently, the shared savings rates available to mssp acos function as a ceiling; an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality score can only reduce, not increase, that rate. however, given that one of the goals of the mssp is to improve quality and patient outcomes, we urge cms to modify the shared savings methodology to make the shared savings rates floors upon which quality scores can be used to award additional sharing points.\n degree of risk in proposed level e. while we believe the shared savings available to acos on the glide path to risk should begin at a higher rate than as proposed by cms, we recognize and appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to create such a glide path that allows for a gradual introduction of two-sided risk. we believe, however, that the degree of risk that acos in the proposed level e of the basic track would be required to assume should not be based upon the lopsided calculation that cms has proposed. specifically, cms proposes to make the benchmark-based loss sharing limit in level e a percentage point higher than the qpp standards while matching the revenue-based loss sharing limit to the qpp. this proposal would leave almost all acos with only one choice: the benchmark-based standard. acos would have to be extremely low-revenue to make selecting the revenue-based standard worthwhile. under this proposal, a large percentage of aco participants in level e would face a difficult benchmark, which could more intensely disadvantage smaller acos by creating larger swings in their results. thus, we recommend that cms fully align the loss sharing limits in basic level e with the standards for advanced apms under the\nqpp. \n\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 19 of 25\n\n the first four years of an enhanced track agreement period and 3 percent in the final year to arrive at a total of 15 percent.\n extension of agreement period length from three years to five years\n we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to extend the current three-year agreement periods to five years. this proposal will add predictability and stability to the mssp and allow acos a longer time horizon to redesign care in accordance with their experience in the program. given the longer agreement periods, we urge cms to create equally long-term program rules and avoid substantially altering them during the course of acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agreement periods. as acos take on more risk and create more innovative care arrangements, they need reassurance that the rules upon which they base their initial investments will be the same rules under which they will participate in the program. to the degree that acos base participation on modeling of the mssp and other aco programs, midstream changes would potentially leaving them with no option but to exit the programs in which they participate. this became apparent in the next generation program, when cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unilateral, mid-stream change to the risk- adjustment cap resulted in the departure of several next generation acos, including hospitals and health systems that were prepared to take on the high degree of risk next generation requires. as participation in the mssp would become more difficult under the proposals in this rule, it is essential that cms not lose participants due to methodological and other rule changes.\n expansion of access to waivers\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals to expand access to and usefulness of waivers of certain medicare program requirements. we encourage cms to consider adopting additional waivers to allow, for example, funding for transportation and other social services.\n skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule. cms proposes to extend the availability of the snf 3-day rule waiver to acos that elect preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment (assuming they are in a two-sided risk model). cms also proposes that beneficiaries that appear on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cumulative assignment list (that cms would create and update quarterly) at any point during the performance year will be eligible for the snf 3-day rule waiver, even though the beneficiary might not appear on any of that aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subsequent quarterly list updates or might not be finally assigned to the aco during retrospective reconciliation for that year. the aha believes this proposal would address one of the main barriers to using the snf 3-day rule waiver, which is the inability to know who is eligible for it. acos have found it challenging to identify to whom the waiver applies and this proposal will make it easier for them to do so, expanding access to treatment for patients.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 20 of 25\n\n billing and payment for telehealth services. cms proposes regulatory changes for the coverage of approved telehealth services furnished during performance years 2020 and beyond by risk-bearing acos with prospectively assigned beneficiaries. we support these proposals that would expand access to telehealth and protection for beneficiaries receiving care via telehealth, but we continue to urge the agency to more generally and broadly expand medicare coverage and payment for telehealth services. the aha will also continue to urge congress to remove the statutory barriers to increased medicare coverage of telehealth services, including the geographic and practice setting limitations on where medicare beneficiaries may receive telehealth services and the limitations on the types of technology that providers may use to deliver services via telehealth.\n proposed changes to benchmarking methodologies\n risk adjustment of historical benchmark. to better account for changes in beneficiary health status between the historical benchmark period and the performance year, cms proposes to use a single methodology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 cms-hcc prospective risk adjustment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to adjust the historical benchmark for changes in severity and case mix for all assigned beneficiaries, including continuously assigned beneficiaries. the aha strongly supports this proposal and believes it would remove unnecessary complexity from the mssp. additionally, the proposal would reverse the current approach that does not adequately capture changes in continuously assigned beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 health status and would improve the accuracy of acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benchmarks by reflecting the increased or decreased costs of treating these beneficiaries.\n in conjunction with this proposal, cms proposes to place a symmetrical cap of +/- 3 percent on acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk scores over the course of each agreement period. the aha appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow risk scores to rise and fall in conjunction with beneficiary health status. however, a 3 percent cap is too low and the five- year period over which it would be spread is too long. while we recognize the benefit of having a cap on the decrease in risk scores, we do not believe 3 percent will capture the significant beneficiary turnover and changes in health status that aco beneficiaries experience. this is especially true as the burden of illness in the medicare population increases over time. we urge cms to provide the modeling on which it based this proposal so that acos can analyze the same data that cms used and provide recommendations for a higher cap that would still meet the needs of both cms and acos.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 21 of 25\n\n track 3 acos experience today: a constant struggle against an outdated risk score under which they are at risk for a population whose risk score was calculated several years prior. such a situation could create a level of risk some acos cannot bear, deterring them from entering a redesigned mssp program. cms has already recognized the necessity of shorter-term caps on risk and price adjustments; the agency capped trend factor variation in the bpci program on a quarter-over-quarter basis and risk scores in the next generation aco program at 3 percent over two years.\n limiting risk scores to a three percent increase or decrease over five-year agreement periods could also incentivize acos to avoid higher risk patients; this is why insurers that participate in medicare advantage (ma) receive annual premium adjustments based on beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hcc risk scores. cms should look to ma and the experience of acos in other programs to determine the flexibility necessary in risk scores to ensure high acuity patients receive the care they need.\n benchmarking methodology for six-month performance years in 2019. for acos that participate in the jan. 1, 2019 to june 30, 2019 performance year, the july 1, 2019 to\ndec. 31, 2019 performance year, or both, cms proposes to use the full 12 months of \n 2019 to calculate the benchmark and assigned beneficiary expenditures for these acos. cms is concerned that any other approach, including the interim reconciliation approach the agency used with acos in the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial cohorts, would introduce further complexity into program calculations and interrupt program operations. however, this proposal traps acos with a full year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth of risk for beneficiaries that they may have only cared for six months of the year. cms has not provided sufficient justification for why it cannot use the relevant six month periods to calculate acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benchmark and assigned beneficiary expenditures. for these reasons, we oppose this policy and urge cms not to finalize it.\n beneficiary notification requirements\n under current regulations, acos must post informational signs in participant facilities and primary care service delivery settings, and they must provide upon request a written beneficiary information notice, for both of which cms provides templates. cms adopted these requirements in the june 2015 aco final rule in response to concerns from acos that the notification rules in place at the time were too burdensome. however, in this rule, cms again makes proposals that would increase the beneficiary notification burden that aco participants would face. specifically, cms proposes to require aco participants to provide additional information to beneficiaries at the first primary care visit of each performance year, including information about voluntary alignment, the provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation in the mssp, and the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opportunity to decline claims data sharing. this notice would be in addition to the existing requirements detailed above.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 22 of 25\n\n this proposal would add to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 regulatory burden as it relates to beneficiary notices and we are concerned it would cause them to divert important resources away from patient care and to aco operations. we recognize and appreciate the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to provide a template for this notice, but we believe its delivery would add unnecessary complexity to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 operations as they would need to expend resources disseminating this notice to providers and ensuring they disseminate it to patients. the requirement could also complicate individual providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to spend as much time as they can focused on patient care. rather than creating a new notice requirement, we urge cms to considering how to strengthen the existing notifications that acos deliver to beneficiaries.\n election of minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss rate (mlr)\n in its efforts to address \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaming\u00e2\u0080\u009d practices by acos that have taken advantage of the mssp, cms proposes to require acos to select their msr/mlr prior to assuming performance-based risk and to apply this selection for the duration of the agreement period. cms bases this proposal on its concern that allowing acos to change their selection during the course of an agreement period would incentivize acos to learn from their experience in the program and select an msr/mlr that maximizes shared savings or avoid shared losses.\n while we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow acos in two-sided risk arrangements the flexibility to choose their msr/mlr, we urge cms to allow acos to alter their msr/mlr throughout the proposed five-year agreement period. we do not agree that allowing for such changes would leave the mssp vulnerable to gaming; in fact, we believe it would be just the opposite. allowing acos to alter their msr/mlr in accordance with their experience in accepting certain levels of risk would allow acos to continue to advance in operating under performance-based risk, grow the competencies to be successful in the mssp, and build an understanding of the benchmark methodology. this flexibility could increase program participation uptake and retention.\n moreover, even experienced acos would need time to understand the implication of the benchmarking proposals included in this rule. that knowledge would be essential to informing their msr/mlr selection and it may take some years in the program to develop it. additionally, the attributed populations of acos can change significantly over time and as an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed population changes, so does its risk profile. cms recognized this need to allow providers to alter their risk thresholds throughout agreement periods when it allowed bpci participants to change their risk track (or \u00e2\u0080\u009cwinsorization\u00e2\u0080\u009d) levels on a quarterly basis.\n\n\n\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 23 of 25\n\n beneficiary assignment\n election of assignment methodology. to execute certain provisions of the bipartisan budget act of 2018, cms proposes to allow all acos to choose prospective beneficiary assignment or preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation. cms also proposes to allow acos to switch their beneficiary assignment selection on an annual basis. the aha strongly supports these proposals and believes they would bring necessary flexibility to the mssp, especially for acos that operate in areas with high patient churn rates. the ability to choose their assignment methodology would also support acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to manage care as they assume greater levels of risk.\n creation of an opt-in assignment methodology. in addition to providing acos with a choice of assignment, cms considers providing beneficiaries the option to opt-in to assignment to a specific aco. in evaluating possible approaches to operationalizing an opt-in methodology, cms considers a \u00e2\u0080\u009chybrid\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach through which beneficiaries that opt-in or voluntarily align with an aco would be prospectively assigned to that\naco. other beneficiaries would be assigned to that aco only if they receive the \n plurality of their primary care services from the aco and receive at least seven primary care services from one or more aco participants in the aco during the applicable assignment window. cms explains in the rule that the seven service threshold is based upon \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe threshold established by an integrated healthcare system in a prior demonstration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d we urge cms to release additional information on data on the proposed seven-service threshold, as we are concerned that this threshold is too high and could have the unintended consequence of significantly lowering several acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 assigned beneficiary counts. before offering pure opt-in assignment or a hybrid approach, we further urge cms to continue to explore the potential burdens an aco could encounter if beneficiaries are permitted to opt-in to aco assignment and how the option would be explained to beneficiaries.\n definition of primary care used in beneficiary assignment. cms regularly revises the definition of primary care services used to assign beneficiaries to acos. in this rule, cms proposes to include in the definition of primary care services current procedural terminology codes for advance care planning services (99497 and 99498). planning for advanced illness care and end-of-life care is an important element of primary care and we support the addition of these codes to the definition of primary care.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 24 of 25\n\n not to finalize the proposed payment collapse or add-on codes and, thus, not to add them to the definition of primary care services.\n monitoring for financial performance\n to address its belief that current regulations are insufficient to monitor acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 financial performance, cms proposes to monitor acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expenditures. cms proposes that, if expenditures are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a single performance year, the agency could take pre-termination actions. if expenditures are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d for an additional performance year of the same agreement period, cms proposes that it may terminate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation in the mssp.\n this proposal is not a necessary or appropriate mechanism for protecting the medicare trust fund. if acos in two-sided models believe they can achieve savings at some point, it would be more protective for the trust fund to allow them to remain in the program and pay shared losses to cms until then. moreover, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automatic advancement proposal would protect against acos who generate losses remaining in the mssp just to take advantage of waivers and other provisions. as those acos are required to take on increasingly more risk, they themselves would incur too many losses to remain in the program indefinitely. as discussed above, it can take several years for acos to understand their patient population and providers in order to generate savings and at the end of two years, acos barely have a single year of performance data. we do not believe acos would want to invest the millions of dollars required to set up and run an aco if they could be kicked out of the program just 24 months later. there already would be sufficient risk to participants under the proposed redesigned program; the risk of being terminated this quickly could be too much for many acos to bear. we recommend cms consider other approaches for monitoring financial performance, such as the use of corrective action plans, which it already uses as a pre-termination action when an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned population falls below 5,000.\n program data and quality measures\n the aha agrees that acos have a unique opportunity to use aggregate part d data to monitor appropriate use of opioids for their assigned beneficiaries and inform their own and wider opioid misuse prevention efforts. as cms describes in the proposed rule, polypharmacy (or the simultaneous use of multiple drugs by a single patient) increases the risk of adverse events including over-utilization of opioid medications. related issues, like patients having prescriptions from multiple practitioners, exacerbate both over-utilization and diversion of opioid medications. with access to aggregate part d data, acos could better monitor their beneficiaries to prevent these risks. in addition, acos often serve as proving grounds for value-based care programs that can be scaled larger with evidence of effectiveness; if acos are able to stymie opioid misuse through data monitoring, it is possible that non-aco providers may be able to do the same.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 25 of 25\n\n the three opioid use-related measures cms suggests for inclusion in the aco quality measure set seem to be appropriately focused on the right patient population. by specifying that patients of interest would be those without cancer or enrolled in hospice, these measures are less likely to harm patients for whom opioid prescriptions are suitable. in addition, these measures address the major risks associated with opioid diversion\u00e2\u0080\u0094high dosages and multiple prescriptions\u00e2\u0080\u0094rather than an overbroad measure of all opioid prescriptions. the aha appreciates that cms has recommended measures endorsed by the national quality forum (nqf), as nqf-endorsement is an indicator of scientific and statistical validity and reliability.\n however, a number of issues with these particular measures should be addressed before they are used as part of the mssp measure set. first, the measures are nqf-endorsed at the health plan level, and not the aco level. we encourage cms to conduct testing to ensure the measures provide accurate, reliable data at the aco level. the importance of accurate reporting of quality measures is particularly high considering the other proposed changes to the mssp that emphasize taking on more risk.\n furthermore, the purpose of the mssp is to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpromote accountability for a patient population, foster coordination of items and services under medicare parts a and b, encourage investment in infrastructure and redesigned care processes for high-quality and efficient health care service delivery, and promote higher value care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d strictly speaking, the mssp program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purpose is not to test out new measures or address specific epidemics, even though acos provide a logical opportunity to do both. obviously, addressing the opioid crisis is a top priority and accountability and coordination for a patient population necessarily involves addressing medication and drug use. it is unclear, though, how these specific quality measures would interact with the other measures currently used in the program. with these concerns in mind, the aha recommends that these measures be first reported on a voluntary or pay-for- reporting basis rather than associated with shared savings outcomes for the first few years.\n\n\n", "0309": "re:

pathways to success mssp proposed rule\r\ndear administrator verma,\r\naugusta care partners is an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient

program seeking feedback on ways  to make  the  program  successful  over  the  long-term  for  patients,  providers,  and  medicare  by improving program accountability and engagement of the program, including increasing program savings; moving to two-sided risk; and ensuring rigorous benchmarking.\n advocate aurora overview\n advocate aurora health, the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 10th largest not-for-profit health care system, with more than 500 sites of care across illinois and wisconsin, is fully committed to the transformation toward value-based care.\n both legacy organizations, advocate health care, in illinois, and aurora health care, in wisconsin, have been transformative  leaders  and  strong  partners  with  the  federal  government,  state  governments,  and commercial payors in the journey to value. with more than one million value-based lives, advocate has one of the largest accountable care organizations (acos) in the country and is a convener in the new bundled

scores to five percent (rather than three percent) during the contract term;\n7. supporting the regional adjustment factor in the benchmark calculation, but with recommended \n removal of aco

existing mssp beneficiary assignment methodology; \n\n10. opposing the proposed revisions to the early termination process; \n\n11. supporting increased program flexibility, particularly with respect to the provision of telehealth \n services;\n12. supporting quality proposals that will lead to improved health outcomes; and \n\n13. supporting removal of the aco-11 measure, which reduces administrative burden. \n\n our comments reflect our strong desire and commitment to partner effectively with the agency to provide high-quality, cost-efficient care centered on value to medicare beneficiaries.\n\n1. support for a 5-year mssp contract term \n\n advocate aurora health welcomes proposed changes that add stability and predictability to the mssp as we strongly agree with cms that increased stability and predictability will further strengthen the program. as such, we strongly support the proposed transition to a five-year contract term from the current three-year term for mssp participants. the expanded period of time will better enable our aco to effectively implement the clinical care practices and operational efficiencies that lead to the delivery of high-quality, cost-efficient healthcare services for our enrollees. however, as discussed in more detail below, we are very concerned that extending the contract term to five years without also increasing the proposed risk ratio cap on the benchmark to five percent (rather than 3 percent) will adversely impact our ability to achieve success; simply put, our enrollees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk scores on average likely will grow higher than three percentage points over a five year period, making it very challenging for us to achieve spending levels below the benchmark unless cms increases the risk ratio cap to at least five percentage points. recognizing that cms seeks to strengthen and encourage successful participation in the mssp, we strongly recommend that the agency couple the proposed five-year contract term with a five percent risk adjustment cap on the benchmark.\n\n2. support for goal of a glide path toward increased risk for basic and enhanced track acos, \n but over longer time periods\n\n\n 3\n otherwise successful mssps will not achieve program goals and otherwise eligible participants will opt not to participate in the program.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 basic track acos: advocate aurora health is very concerned that the proposed two-year period for progression to a two-sided risk model in the proposed mssp basic track is simply insufficient for the development and implementation of the infrastructure necessary for acos to achieve program success. our experience aligns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statements in the proposed rule that mssp participants who have been in the program for longer periods of time generally have achieved greater levels of success.  therefore, we strongly urge cms to allow acos to participate in the program for four years without downside risk before transitioning to two-sided risk. we firmly believe that giving mssp participants sufficient time to learn and effectively implement clinical care and administrative processes will lead to lasting aco success. a four-year period offers acos the experience they require, but also meets cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal of transitioning to two-sided risk within a reasonable timeframe.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 enhanced track acos: cms proposes a significant increase in risk in movement from the basic track level e to the enhanced track. as stated above, more experience enables acos to better understand the clinical practices and administrative processes necessary to deliver high- quality care that improves patient health outcomes in a cost-efficient manner. we are concerned that the proposed transition from basic track level e to the enhanced track represents a significant increase in risk that otherwise successful acos may not want to accept and therefore may deter further participation in the program. therefore, we strongly encourage cms to allow basic track level e mssp participants to remain in basic track level e indefinitely where they will experience meaningful two-sided risk, as well as create additional levels with the basic track or another glide path within the enhanced track toward higher levels of two-sided risk.\n\n3. maintain the current level 50 percent shared savings rate for one-sided acos \n\n advocate aurora very much supports and seeks to contribute to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical policy goal of bolstering the mssp. as such, we are concerned that the proposal to lower the shared savings rate from the current 50 percent to the proposed 25 percent for acos without downside risk will deter providers from participating in the program. a lower level of shared savings simply does not provide the necessary incentive for acos to cover the initial investment costs or incent an aco to move quickly into a downside risk model. therefore, we urge cms to maintain the current 50 percent shared savings rate for acos with no downside risk to ensure more participation and engagement\n\n4. delay the proposed timeline and start-date for new mssp contracts  \n\n advocate aurora health shares cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal of making modifications as appropriate to the mssp that will increase the chances for lasting program success. however, we are very concerned that the agency proposes many significant program changes for implementation under a short timeframe that will be very challenging and burdensome for acos to implement successfully. as such, we respectfully ask cms to delay the proposed july 1, 2019 start date and strongly recommend at least a six-month participant preparation period for the application cycle after publication of the final rule so that participants can adequately prepare and successfully implement any changes adopted in the final rule.\n below we offer several specific examples of the substantial operational challenges and burdens that would arise under a july 1, 2019 start date from our illinois track 1+ aco and its participating providers:\n\n\n 4\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 participant agreements: our track 1+ aco was advised by our cms coordinator to upload participant agreements for the 2019 year on the current 2018 agreement schedule. however, if the proposed july 1, 2019 start date in the proposed rule goes into effect, we are assuming that we will need to re-execute participant agreements again with our aco tax identification numbers (tin).1 the track 1+ aco has more than 800 tins, and executing a new participant agreement within a timeframe of less than six months is burdensome and operationally not feasible for advocate aurora and does not lend itself to a thoughtful, committed process. moreover, and importantly, such work is also frustrating and confusing for our participant providers.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 secondary repayment limits: as a current downside risk model, the track 1+ aco already have a secondary repayment mechanism in place. lack of current guidance on the limits of the secondary repayment or how to execute the secondary repayment from january to july of 2019 causes uncertainty, and will most likely result in extra costs to our aco to change the secondary repayment limits mid-year.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 mid-year start date: the mid-year start date, if implemented, would add confusion and make the program less predictable for our participating providers whose prior experience with the program has been based on full calendar year performance periods.   two of our aco will most likely be responsible for monitoring financial and quality performance for two distinct prospectively assigned populations, which will cause confusion and frustration; especially for the engaged provider monitoring their beneficiaries. we recommend that cms promote more stability and consistency in the program in calendar year program roll out.  rather than a six- month extension, a one-year extension of the current model would allow for providers to prepare and understand changes versus feeling the need to reorganize mid-year and avoid extra burden associated with monitoring two distinct prospectively assigned populations.\n again, these examples illustrate the significant challenges our illinois track 1+ aco and participant providers would face in transitioning to the enhanced track under an accelerated timeframe and a non-calendar year basis. we have very much appreciated the many changes to date that the agency has implemented throughout the medicare program to meaningfully reduce provider burden and allow providers to spend more time with patients.  implementing new mssp contracts under such an accelerated timeframe does not align with the other welcomed reductions in provider burden, as well as the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals of strengthening and stabilizing the mssp. as such, we urge cms to enhance program stability and predictably by delaying implementation of the new mssp contract periods until no earlier than six months after publication of the final rule and on a calendar year cycle.\n\n5. eliminate the proposed high revenue and low revenue aco designations to ensure a level \n playing field for all mssp participants\n advocate aurora health firmly believes that hospital- and physician-led acos have the ability to achieve program success in the mssp. furthermore, our experience very much suggests that, regardless of structure, significant investments are needed in population health platforms and care redesign models for acos to bear risk. therefore, we urge cms to eliminate the proposed distinction between high revenue and low revenue acos and instead ensure a level playing field for all acos participating in the mssp. establishing such distinctions sets up a system that disadvantages hospital-led acos and limits the types of innovations needed to build a high performing healthcare system from which numerous current and future beneficiaries can benefit. it is our experience that the best way to drive high quality of\n\n\n 5\n care for beneficiaries is to create incentives that drive all providers in a system to collaborate and innovate to deliver high-quality, cost-effective healthcare. the goal should rather be to incent all providers to work collaboratively and not disadvantage one aco structure over another. thus, advocate aurora health urges cms to eliminate the proposed distinctions between high revenue and low revenue acos and maintain consistent standards for all mssp participants that foster the provision of more coordinated, high-quality, cost-efficient care.\n\n6. support for improved risk adjustment in the benchmark calculation methodology, but increasing \n the proposed cap to five percent from three percent\n we greatly appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recognition for the need to apply an increase or decrease risk ratio cap in the benchmark calculation methodology over the course an agreement period.  appropriate application of risk adjustment recognizes that the underlying health of a beneficiary population changes over time and, specifically with respect to the mssp, over the course of an agreement period. as such, advocate aurora welcomes cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to incorporate cms-hcc risk scores into the benchmark calculation methodology.\n we are very concerned, however, that the +/- 3% proposed risk adjustment cap is too restrictive and does not allow for clinically appropriate changes in beneficiary risk scores, especially over the proposed extended five-year agreement period. we also understand the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concern about establishing inappropriate incentives to increase aco enrollee risk scores. therefore, to achieve an appropriate balance between acknowledging the changes to the underlying risk of the beneficiary population and discouraging inappropriate coding practices, we strongly encourage cms to consider increasing the proposed cap to +/- 5% cap. adding this meaningful change in risk adjustment will appropriately encourage more providers to remain in and join the mssp.\n in addition, we also wish to express our appreciation and support for cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed elimination in distinction of new and continuously assigned beneficiaries for purposes of risk adjustment. elimination of this distinction provides more transparency into the risk adjustment calculation for mssp participants, enabling us to better understand and achieve success in this program.\n\n7. support for the increased use of regional factors in the benchmark calculation with \n recommended removal of aco beneficiaries from the calculation\n advocate aurora believes the proposed regional adjustment to the mssp benchmark calculation methodology is a step in the right direction. we agree with cms that adding the national benchmarking blend with the regional factor will help mitigate the issue of large market share acos driving the regional benchmark, putting those acos in a position where they are having to compete against themselves. however, we strongly encourage cms to go further with the regional and national benchmark blend to have aco beneficiaries removed from the regional benchmark calculations. therefore, the regional benchmark would compare how acos perform to medicare fee-for- service (ffs) in that region. this would further provide a true comparison of aco costs to the overall region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cost.\n\n8. support for overall increased patient engagement, but without the beneficiary notification \n requirements as proposed\n\n\n 6\n concerns with the proposed beneficiary notification at the first primary care visit of the performance year, including the following:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 unsuccessful as a prior requirement: this proposed requirement was previously a requirement of participation in the mssp. however, cms removed the requirement because directly notifying beneficiaries resulted in tremendous beneficiary confusion. it was our experience that the beneficiary notice on average resulted in an additional ten minutes per visit just so that the provider or staff could explain the template letter. the template letter was not beneficiary friendly and was not written at an appropriate literacy level. this resulted in further confusion, and many beneficiaries became overwhelmingly concerned that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgovernment\u00e2\u0080\u009d had their data, asking to opt-out of data sharing, which limited the aco from receiving the data that would improve and better coordinate beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 care.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increased provider burden: implementing the proposed requirement would require providers to reformat their electronic medical record (emr) systems to include reminder prompts and documentation templates for sharing the beneficiary notice, all of which increase financial and administrative burdens for providers that would need to implement and enhance their emr system.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 defining a primary care visit: primary care visits are very loosely defined in the mssp program, assuming step 1 and step 2 attribution are used to define primary care visits. this methodology includes many specialists that do not traditionally identify as a primary care and therefore would make compliance with this proposed requirement very difficult and confusing for the provider to meet. therefore, we would urge cms to consider using traditional primary care specialties (e.g. family medicine, internal medicine, and geriatrics) to define primary care visits in order for acos to comply with the proposed requirement should cms ultimately adopt it in the final rule.\n furthermore, we commend cms for wanting to take a more beneficiary-centric approach toward aco participation. however, we strongly encourage cms to provide acos with more flexibility to provide relevant beneficiary engagement outreach. for example, we recommend acos have the ability to conduct and promote annual wellness visits, cancer screenings, or a diabetes follow-up, that correspond with the aco quality program. the outreach should also be disseminated in a manner of the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice, email for example, if this is more convenient for the beneficiary. as currently defined in the marketing guidance, beneficiary engagement is very limiting and prohibits the aco from being able to support individual providers in engaging beneficiaries in a meaningful way.\n\n9. maintain the existing mssp beneficiary assignment methodology  \n\n\n\n 7\n changes to the mssp assignment methodology, we urge cms to test alternative approaches in smaller models in a variety of markets to determine whether they meet programmatic goals.\n\n10. recommendation against proposed revisions to early program termination policies \n\n advocate aurora does not support the proposed early termination policy based on spending related to shared savings and loss for 2+ years. we understand the sentiment for early termination based on 2+ years of losses, especially if the aco is not showing improvement.  however, early termination based on shared savings seems arbitrary and minimizes the integrity of the program, as the point of the mssp program is for acos to continue to lower costs and receive shared savings. further, to assist and help acos succeed and achieve shared savings or lower costs, we encourage cms to make the program data and results more transparent and timely so that acos can actively monitor their performance in more real time to manage costs and provide high quality care.\n\n11. support for increased program flexibility, particularly with respect to the provision of telehealth \n services\n we appreciate the proposed expansion of the payment rule waivers, especially the telehealth waiver. such waiver enables our acos to use innovative delivery methods to provide high-quality, cost-efficient care to enrollees. these waivers represent the types of changes that will contribute to the long-term success of the mssp.\n advocate aurora recently piloted virtual visits with other capitated contracts, and as we evaluate the expansion of these capabilities, reimbursement for different services that can be provided virtually will only increase our ability to provide our beneficiaries greater access to care in a lower cost setting. we support and commend cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus to increase access to telehealth services and encourage the agency to continue pursuing similar policies that promote innovative technology to improve access to care.\n\n12. support for quality-related proposals that will lead to improved patient health outcomes \n\n advocate aurora supports the reduction of the aco measure set proposed in the rule. such changes reduce burden and improve efficiency for providers and therefore we welcome them as proposed. moreover, we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement to more outcome based quality measures.  these measures drive improvements in care that lead to improved patient health outcomes.\n further, we support cms providing acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 aggregated data on opioid use. however, we also encourage cms to go further and provide all medication use and substance use diagnoses aggregated data for beneficiaries. currently this information is removed from the aco data and we believe that it is important to monitor for the total health of beneficiaries.\n\n\n 8\n than dosage when determining the most appropriate metrics to help address and respond to the opioid epidemic.\n\n13. support for the removal of the aco-11 measure \n\n we greatly appreciate the removal of the aco-11 measure related to certified ehr technology (cehrt) attestation for the mssp program in the proposed rule. we believe an attestation to evaluate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of cehrt not only reduces burden on providers but also aligns with the requirements of other advance alternative payment models and we greatly appreciate the consistency.\n however, the proposed rule is unclear if basic levels a-d would still be required to comply with promoting interoperability requirements for merit-based incentive payment system (mips) purposes. we urge cms to clarify whether acos subject to the mips would not be required to report promoting interoperability (pi) data and would instead see pi performance category weights redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories.\n conclusion\n again,  we  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  provide  our  feedback. advocate aurora is  committed  to working  with  policymakers  at  all  levels  of  government  to  promote  and  preserve  the  health  of  the individuals, families, and communities of illinois and wisconsin, and to advance innovation in health care delivery to ensure quality and improve outcomes for all who are served by the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care system. advocate aurora appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts and we stand ready to be a resource to the agency as you work to alleviate regulatory burdens and improve the marketplace to improve access and lower cost of care for individuals, families, providers, and the nation.\n please do not hesitate to contact meghan woltman, vice president, government and community relations (630/929-6614, meghan.woltman@advocatehealth.com) should you have any questions or if we can be of any assistance.\n regards,\n\n gary stuck, do faafp

letter:  cms-1701-p\non behalf of the illinois rural community care organization (ircco), i would like to submit our comments in response to the proposed rules for the medicare shared savings program (mssp).  ircco represents 25 independent critical access and rural hospitals and their associated rural health clinics and independent physician practices spread across the state of illinois.  ircco is in its 4th year in the mssp track 1 and provides care to more than 25,000 medicare beneficiaries.  while we have not gained shared savings yet, ircco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accountable care organization (aco) participants have made tremendous progress towards changing their processes to a value based care model.\nwe are disappointed that the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) does not have a better understanding of rural providers and the challenges of bringing multiple, different independents together.  it takes time and resources to develop new care processes.  it takes time for independent medical providers to see the advantages of chronic care managements and to establish alternative urgent care center to avoid unnecessary emergency department visits.  rural providers are criticism because they are reluctant to take risk and slow to change.  in response, ircco offers how collectively 25 independent providers changed their work flow and processes to make a difference for their beneficiaries and local communities. we developed our programs and processes ourselves, and we believe will be lasting changes for the right reasons \u00e2\u0080\u0093 better care for our rural residents and good stewards of healthcare resources and dollars.  lastly, we offer our concerns and comments related to the proposed cms mssp rules.\nlisted below are ircco successes as a result of participation in mssp track 1.\nreduced emergency department (ed) utilization rate per facility and several ircco hospitals were able to reduce their readmission rates when 10 percent to one percent within a 12 month period of time.\nsubstantially increased the annual well visit rate for ircco participants starting in 2015 with less than two percent of the beneficiaries receiving annual well visits to an average rate of 40 percent.  most rural primary care providers had not put in place their required quality data capture programs and had to be built.\nincreased the aggregate hierarchical condition category (hcc) score by nine percent which more accurately reflects the complexity of the beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 conditions. with improved accuracy of coding, rural based aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s are preparing for the conversion to medicare advantage or other type of risk bearing alternative payment systems by 2020.\ndeveloped key performance indicators for primary care practices and management of beneficiaries through the continuum of care.  there had been no quality or financial performance measurements for primary care.  all ircco participants own at least one rural health clinic and/or physician practice and are learning how to manage primary care offices.  conversion now to data driven clinical care will propel our rural providers to use the data to evaluate and engage in higher quality care.\ndeveloped care coordination services throughout the rural hospital system and created follow up procedures for the different levels of care.  rarely were follow up appointments with primary care providers made for inpatient and ed discharges and only call backs for outpatient surgery were performed.  now, ircco participants have incorporated care coordination plans and call backs into their daily work at all levels of care with attention to social service needs. the fruits of this effort are seen in reduced readmission rates and increase in primary care visits.\ncreated awareness to the high cost of beneficiary care in the skilled nursing facilities (snf) surrounding the aco participants.  medical providers were not following through with beneficiaries discharged to nursing homes; consequently, the aco affiliated snfs had higher cost per stay, greater length of stay and only average star ratings.  having access to factual information based on cms claims can now be shared with beneficiaries and their families discharged to skilled nursing facilities. we anticipate this will lead to a higher value service for medicare beneficiaries and is consistent with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals to bring snf based care into the value-based care reimbursement initiative.\nimproved the management processes of primary care practices and clinics where aco critical access and rural hospitals recognize best practices for managing primary care similar to how hospitals strive for best practices in other departments. the introduction of management systems has accelerated the conversion of a cottage industry into a system base industry.\nincreased aco participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awareness to the cost of care per beneficiary having access as part of the mssp to the claims data and where beneficiaries go for care.  ircco has narrowed the gap between our beneficiary costs and the rate assigned based on cms hcc score rate as well as gradually decreasing the overall spend for our rural beneficiaries.  attention to cost and coding has been the first step in the process of decreasing healthcare costs.  next steps will be to manage downstream/specialty and other services used within the healthcare system.\ninitiated best practice specialty tracking programs to create loop closures and to pull patient care back to primary care providers for integration of care and duplication of services.  when ircco started its efforts in 2015, not one ircco participant had a tracking program in place for beneficiaries sent to specialists or to snf services; today, aco participants are building or have built referral tracking system.\ndeveloped best of practices for managing diabetics setting the gold bar for the a1c less than 8 where primary care practices were not using their disease registers and tracking diabetics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 care and treatment plans.  two ircco hospitals built successful programs that are now being evaluated and/or implemented with the other 23 facilities.\ninitiated chronic care management (ccm) programs and seeing decrease in avoidable and unnecessary visit to the ed and calls to primary care providers.  ccm technicians are managing compliance and social service problems and beneficiaries are happier.  multiple success stories where physicians have been against ccm and within 6-9 months thank ccm staff for their work.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey get it\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nincreased patient satisfaction scores and market share.  early adopters of aco and patient centered medical home strategies are experiencing increased patient satisfaction scores within the hospital setting and a gradual return/increase in their primary care market.\nlisted below are irrco comments/concerns regarding the mssp proposed rules\n1.\ttop concern:  risk too soon.   ircco is most concerned about the rapid push to risk especially for rural providers.  while we recognize the value of taking risk to achieve greater commitment by medical and hospital providers, there are many barriers and concerns that must be overcome.  we ask that cms extend the time frame for rural providers and/or decrease percent at risk.  our reasons are as follows:\ncritical access hospitals receive cost based reimbursement at 101% minus two percent for sequestration (technically 99 percent).  their bottom lines are often less than one percent and they have no margin for financial error and limited reserves.  there is no way a hospital/community board member will authorize even 2-3 percent of medicare \u00e2\u0080\u009crevenues\u00e2\u0080\u009d going to risk without greater assurances the hospital can meet the financial goal.  many hospital board members are local business owners or leaders in the community and unfamiliar with healthcare payment programs.  critical access and rural hospitals will struggle even with purchasing a surety bond payment.\nover the last 15-20 years, the rural market share has decreased with the growth of specialty services and push for referrals to centers of excellence.  while specialty services are needed, rural providers do not have systems in place to manage downstream referrals and spend.  ircco participants can manage only 30-40 percent of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeneficiary spend\u00e2\u0080\u009d through their own primary and local services.  the other 60-70 percent is spent with specialty care and larger facilities as well as snfs.  without solid tracking systems in place, it will be difficult for rural primary care to manage the overall spend.  rural providers are learning but these systems take time to put in place and relationships rebuilt with needed specialty and snf services.  under the new plan, rural providers will be put at risk within three years and will not have systems in place and tested.  there is no standard electronic medical records among healthcare providers.\neven though ircco received aim investment funds, the funds were used to build the necessary aco infrastructure, purchase access to an aco claims platform and provide education/training on value based care principles and strategies.  this then left ircco participants having to invest their own dollars to hire care coordination staff, participate in many aco and hospital meetings and training sessions, analyze their primary care work flow, develop outreach with patients and improve focus on care gaps and prevention to name a few expenses.   in addition, the ircco organization invested staff time and resources as well.  hospitals and organizations have to budget staff time and resources and advancing risk too soon while cause rural providers to become discourage and leave the mssp while truly making great strides toward value based care. if ircco had to move to risk by today and within the proposed year time frame, we would have had to leave mssp and lose what we have gained in moving the dial to a value based care system.  lastly, the vast majority of rural medical practitioners are employed.  it takes time (minimum of three years) to set new practitioner performance parameters to match the values of the mssp.  the learning curve is tremendous and takes patience and for true change to be lasting. the physician fee for service model has been in place for years! pushing too fast to risk will prevent other rural providers from joining the aco program in the future.  most importantly, it would have been extremely difficult for ircco and other like rural acos to have been successful without the investment funds.  rural is as important as urban areas to improve our quality and reduce overall healthcare costs.\nircco participants (hospitals, clinics and practices) account for 15 disparate electronic medical record systems and another obstacle for independent rural participants have to overcome or work around.  in addition, many practices having little understanding of how to abstract data and value of disease registry for tracking chronic diseases and best practices. most rural practitioners and clinic staff have limited knowledge of their electronic records and data analysis as rural has an older workforce and limited access to data specialists. also, our state does not have a central health information exchange system so tracking admission, discharges and transfers is very difficult for managing care coordination and return to primary care.\nsequestration.  under the risk model, will sequestration (two percent loss) be factored in?  both models?\nsecond concern:  proposed two new models/ basic and enhanced mssp. while ircco likes the idea of simplifying the model choices, we do not believe the basic and enhanced mssp models are a good fit for rural providers.  we propose and willing to work with cms to develop a rural model with appropriate quality and performance measures that reflect primary care and rural that address the volume issues.  if rural had a mssp model that would better reflect the care provided in our facilities, maybe rural would be able to move to risk within an agreement term.  it truly takes a minimum 3-4 years to implement the required process changes to be successful coming from aco experience with models that better fit physician organizations and large healthcare systems.\nthird concern:  beneficiary notification.  2015 mssp participants (irrco was one) were required to notify the medicare beneficiary that practitioner and/or hospital is in an aco and allow the beneficiary to opt out.  it was an absolute mess.  beneficiaries had no clue what an aco was and those that hesitated thought the participation gave the government greater access to their information.  it was a paper work burden and time-consuming process that added no value.  ircco strongly discourages the required beneficiary notification.\nfourth concern:  high revenue-low revenue.  the delineation between high and low revenue volume acos is very confusing.  how does a rural aco with 25 small rural hospitals fit?  why the difference needed?\nfifth concern:  we support the concerns expressed by our rural aco colleagues whose agreement ends december 2018 and will be offered limited options to continue to grow and develop their acos by the push to risk model tracks in 2019.  ircco is fortunate that we\nsnf waiver for all aco participants.  we appreciate the opportunity for critical access hospitals to have the same option of the snf waiver.\nbeneficiary incentives.  we agree with the opportunity to incentivize beneficiaries to participate in well visits and other related prevention programs.\nregional basing of rates.  we agree with the proposal to adjust aco financial benchmarks based on regions and comparable populations.  being rural, this would be a benefit as we would have gained shared savings for 2017 if our historic benchmark had not been adjusted down using the current methodology.\nsummary\nircco is partnering with eight other independent rural acos (mssps and clinically integrated networks) so that we can find an option to leverage our small numbers from 5,000+ to more than 200,000 medicare beneficiaries collectively.  our group of independent rural acos (all not managed by an outside company) would like the opportunity to pilot a large rural medicare aco and test out measures and performance standards that are rural centric.  rural aco hospital participants are connected to their medical practitioners and communities.  we can make that conversion.  some have been able to have early success while others, like ircco, are making great strides and will be our marks.  it just takes longer to turn our ship as multiple independents without the risk of immediate failure.\nrural acos believe we can be successful under aco/value based care models.  we choose to grow and provide better care services for our beneficiaries and we choose to be good stewards of medicare dollars.  in summary, we ask cms to reconsider the time line and strategies for basic and enhanced models and be open to developing a rural aco track that best reflects our services and population.\nrespectfully submitted,\npat schou, fache\nexecutive director\nillinois rural community care organization (\u0013 hyperlink \"http://www.iruralhealth.org\"

aco currently in the first year (py 2018) of a second three year agreement period.\r\nif we opt to continue under the terms of our current agreement (through 12/31/2020), we have the ability to share savings\r\nup to 50% (if msr is achieved), based on our quality results. if we were to opt out of our current agreement early, we would\r\nthen be eligible for shared savings at a initial maximum rate of 25%. is that a \"motivational\" change to move\r\ntrack 1 acos to new model options?\r\n\r\n2. quality performance - there are acos currently performing at a 95%+ level in their quality (gpro)

just short of our msr, which failed to result\r\nin shared savings $'s for the aco. if mssp is about cost and improving quality, it may be beneficial to further develop\r\nthe proposed model to financially reward those acos sustaining a very high level in their quality performance, as well as\r\nthose reducing costs.\r\n\r\na suggestion would be to implement a \"+\" or \"-\" risk band in terms of historical spend. acos performing within\r\nthe \"+\" or \"-\" range, achieving a high level in its quality performance, would be eligible for a financial incentive.\r\nmany acos are spending

proposed rule\r\ndear administrator verma,\r\naugusta care partners is an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient

administrator verma:\n\n the national health council (nhc) appreciates the opportunity to respond to the proposed rule entitled, \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 (the proposed rule). the nhc fully supports hhs\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s interest in testing new models of care that enhance alignment of incentives, engage patients in defining high-value care, focus on outcomes that matter to patients, and construct efficient arrangements among stakeholders. the nhc appreciates cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s efforts toward beneficiary engagement and patient centeredness. we offer our comments to further amplify the patient voice in policy initiatives that, like the proposed rule, might impact health care for individuals with chronic diseases and disabilities.\n\n founded in 1920, the nhc is the only organization that brings together all segments of the health community to provide a united voice for the more than 160 million people with chronic diseases and disabilities and their family caregivers. made up of more than 120 diverse national health-related organizations and businesses, the nhc's core membership includes the nation\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s leading patient advocacy organizations, which control its governance and policy-making process. other members include professional and membership associations, nonprofit organizations with an interest in health, and representatives from the pharmaceutical, generic drug, health insurance, device, and biotechnology industries.\n\n the nhc focuses its comments on five proposed refinements to the medicare shared savings program:\n\n e the nhc strongly supports cms-approved, aco beneficiary incentive programs that improve the patient and caregiver experience;\n e the nhc urges cms to adopt a prospective, beneficiary-driven, opt-in methodology for aco beneficiary assignment;\n nhc comments on aco proposed rule october 16, 2018 page 2 of 6\n e any medicare aco collaboration with stand-alone part d prescription drug plans (pdps)\n should be patient directed, and not offer additional drug-prescribing incentives to providers;\n e cms should ensure that complex patients have access to aco providers and receive appropriate treatment within an aco; and\n e cms should engage with patients and patient organizations to determine whether current quality measures actually measure what patients care about and make the improvements and additions necessary to increase the patient centeredness of all measure sets.\n\n the nhc strongly supports cms-approved, aco beneficiary incentive programs that improve the patient and caregiver experience.\n\n the nhc strongly supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to allow certain acos to establish cms-approved, beneficiary incentive programs.' the nhc understands these programs would be designed to encourage beneficiaries to obtain medically necessary primary care services. we are particularly encouraged by the set of potential beneficiary incentives set forth in the proposed rule, including home modifications, electronic-alert systems, meal programs, and treatment-adherence tools, as these add-on benefits are likely to be of high value to patients with chronic diseases and disabilities and their caregivers.\n\n the nhc agrees that aco success is, in large part, dependent on patients receiving the care they need when they need it. patients with chronic diseases and disabilities have a unique set of health care needs and often require specialized care. we encourage cms to ensure that acos implement any beneficiary incentive program in a manner that ensures maximal flexibility to match incentives with individual patient needs and goals. vouchers redeemable for transportation to and from medical appointments, for example, could make the difference between access to primary care services and reliance on emergency room care for one patient, yet have little practical value to another.\n\n the nhc expects that incentives that enable patients to better address and manage chronic conditions will improve patient outcomes and the caregiver experience, while reducing overall health care expenditures. thus, we applaud the proposed addition of beneficiary incentive programs to cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s overall patient engagement strategy.\n\n the nhc urges cms to adopt a prospective, beneficiary-driven, opt-in methodology for aco beneficiary assignment.\n\n the nhc appreciates cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s interest in exploring a beneficiary opt-in approach as an alternative beneficiary-assignment methodology. we agree that this assignment methodology is more patient centered than existing methodologies and is likely to strengthen the engagement of beneficiaries in their health care. in proposing this alternative, cms noted its receipt of stakeholder feedback suggesting that \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3under the current beneficiary-assignment methodology, it can be difficult for an aco to effectively manage a beneficiary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s care when there is little or no\n\n\n 1 beneficiary incentive programs let acos pay a medicare beneficiary up to $20 (updated annually based on the consumer price index for all urban consumers) for each qualifying service furnished to a beneficiary. 1899(m)(1)(a)\n of the social security act (as added by section 50341 of the bipartisan budget act).\n\n nhc comments on aco proposed rule october 16, 2018 page 3 of 6\n incentive or requirement for the beneficiary to cooperate with the patient-management practices of the aco.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5\n we strongly encourage cms to adopt the proposed patient opt-in assignment methodology and believe that the opportunity to make this affirmative choice is an essential element of patient engagement. not only does it further the goal of patient centeredness by accounting for personal health care needs, goals, and preferences, but it facilitates transparency between the individual and their health care providers. we strongly believe that any time a payment model incorporates incentives to drive what care is offered and when, patients must be informed and can opt in or opt out.\n\n similarly, the nhc believes that a prospective, opt-in approach is important for logistical purposes. patients must know how to navigate the system in which they receive care, understand the sets of incentives that may drive decisions, and appreciate their own role within the model to ensure they have the best opportunity to attain their health goals. unless a patient is aware of their aco assignment, and is an active participant toward the program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s goals, there is a risk that provider and patient goals, and strategies for reaching them, are not aligned.\n\n the nhc further urges cms to strengthen its processes to ensure that beneficiaries have all the information they need to understand what an aco is, how it works, what incentives might influence providers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 care recommendations, and how to access the benefits of an aco (including any beneficiary incentive program) and resolve concerns about level or quality of care in an\naco. while cms currently publishes a beneficiary-directed, informational document entitled,\n \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3accountable care organizations and you: frequently asked questions (faqs) for people with medicare,\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 we are concerned it lacks a clear and concise explanation of what incentives exist, how they might impact care choices, and what protections are available to ensure patients are informed about all relevant treatment options. these factors are important to allow patients to have an opportunity to make decisions about aco opt-in based upon their goals and preferences.\n\n individuals with chronic diseases and disabilities have complex care needs; most would embrace opportunities to reduce costs associated with their care if their health outcomes are not compromised, particularly if their out-of-pocket costs are reduced or they receive high-value beneficiary incentives. we suggest cms develop informational materials in a variety of modalities, formats, and languages, to ensure medicare beneficiaries have a clear understanding of the benefits and potential risks/compromises associated with acos. for example, short, informational videos for viewing in a provider\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s office, or as part of an outreach and educational campaign similar to what has been used for marketplace plan enrollment, could be augmented with brochures and clinician scripts for face-to-face visits. we urge cms to ensure beneficiary-informational materials and instructions to aco providers to ensure patients the opportunity for informed consent, are developed before the next beneficiary assignment period.\n\n\n\n 2 83 fed reg 41876.\n 3 https://www.medicare.gov/pubs/pdf/11588.pdf (accessed september 26, 2018).\n\n nhc comments on aco proposed rule october 16, 2018 page 4 of 6\n any medicare aco collaboration with stand-alone part d prescription drug plans (pdps) should be patient directed, and not offer additional drug-prescribing incentives to providers.\n\n in its proposed rule, cms seeks comment on how it might encourage collaboration between acos and stand-alone part d plan sponsors. individuals with chronic conditions, particularly those with multiple chronic conditions, have unique needs in managing their total health and often rely on specific combinations of treatments, including prescription drugs. the nhc supports care coordination strategies likely to reduce the risk of medication-associated adverse events and improve medication adherence.\n\n we support cms initiatives to encourage collaboration directed toward ensuring that patients are receiving their prescribed medications and taking them as prescribed. examples of this type of collaboration might include pharmacy \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3pill pack\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 packaging to better enable individuals relying on several therapies to take each as directed, or \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3syncing\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 of prescription refills to minimize the number of trips to the pharmacy a patient must make and reduce the chance of delayed prescription refills. the nhc believes that these collaborative approaches provide value to patients and acos.\n\n however, the nhc is concerned that cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s interest in pursuing \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3approaches to structuring financial arrangements to reward acos and part d sponsors for improved health outcomes and lower growth in expenditures for medicare ffs beneficiaries\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 may inject inadvertent incentives.\n permitting manufacturer financial incentives, discounts, and price concessions to be passed on from part d plans to clinicians prescribing their drugs could drive provider decisions toward financial considerations that are tied to prescribing higher-cost treatments or drugs for which manufacturer-negotiated discounts and price concessions increase their own profits. this could result in higher patient cost-sharing and ultimately higher costs to the medicare system.\n\n we ask that cms carefully consider potential unintended consequences of such a policy change and create appropriate safeguards to ensure that these types of collaborations improve patient care without creating incentives that lead to higher costs or impede patient access to the most appropriate treatment. the nhc expects that as cms develops a more granular vision of aco/pdp collaborative arrangements, stakeholders will be better able to identify the types of patient protections, checks, and balances, needed to avert unintended consequences such as higher costs of compromised patient outcomes. at a minimum, patients should be informed of the nature of any collaborative financial arrangement, and how it might impact their clinician\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s decision to prescribe one drug over another. furthermore, we believe it is important that savings from any arrangement between pharmacy programs and clinicians be passed on to patients.\n\n cms should ensure that complex patients have access to aco providers and receive appropriate treatment within an aco.\n\n as cms shifts its focus toward encouraging acos to adopt a two-sided risk arrangement, the nhc urges the agency to ensure that the incentives placed upon acos to reduce expenditures do not adversely impact individuals with complex health care needs. specifically, we remain concerned that providers will be encouraged to direct patients to least expensive care rather than most appropriate care \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 potentially resulting in underutilization of new and/or costlier technologies though they might be the best option. we remain concerned that the existing\n nhc comments on aco proposed rule october 16, 2018 page 5 of 6\n beneficiary safeguards, including appeals processes, are insufficient to address the impact on patients when providers do not offer access to new treatments that may improve patient outcomes.\n\n the nhc is concerned that acos operating under a two-sided risk arrangement may be discouraged from enrolling patients with complex health care needs, as they likely require a greater level of services. providers should instead be incentivized to enroll these types of patients, especially those likely to benefit most from the care coordination acos offer. at a minimum, cms should ensure that its benchmarking and evaluation mechanisms do not have the unintended effect of disincentivizing aco enrollment of individuals with chronic diseases and disabilities.\n\n we are similarly concerned that the prospective nature of benchmarking in a two-sided risk arrangement can shift the incremental costs of newly-available treatments to acos and their participating providers. patients seeking treatment for serious, potentially life-threatening conditions should be able to rely on their providers to present treatment options and recommendations consistent with their goals and preferences, even when the most appropriate care may also be the most expensive. we urge cms to develop mechanisms to neutralize aco disincentives for offering treatment options that are too new to be accounted for within the benchmarking calculations. medicaid managed care organization (mco) contracts, for example, often provide for a fee-for-service carve-out for newly available treatments. in addition, cms could collect and assess claims data to compare aco and non-aco fee-for-service care and proactively identify emerging patterns impacting beneficiary care. the nhc also urges cms to ensure that patients have a process for submitting and resolving complaints, concerns, or questions on treatment options or other aspects of care.\n\n we believe these kinds of protections are essential to ensuring acos, particularly those in early phases of transitioning to two-sided risk arrangements, are not unduly driven by cost-reduction considerations with respect to the patients they choose to treat, or how they choose to treat them.\n\n cms should engage with patients and patient organizations to determine whether current quality measures used actually measure what patients care about most and make the improvements and additions necessary to increase the patient centeredness of all measure set.\n\n the nhc appreciates that cms has historically selected quality measures for the medicare shared savings program by harmonizing the set with other federal incentive programs. we, therefore, fully support the agency in its efforts to develop an aco quality measure set that is consistent with the agency\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s meaningful measures initiative. similarly, we applaud the significant work cms is undertaking across programs to address excess opioid utilization and urge it to implement its proposal to adopt aco quality measures that reflect appropriate opioid prescribing as well as clinician detection of high-risk behaviors indicative of opioid misuse or abuse.\n\n the nhc believes that as the administration explores shared-risk arrangements and other value- based care strategies, the question of how \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3value\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 is defined and quality is assessed cannot be addressed without the patient voice. patients want clinically effective treatment options that are relevant to their personal circumstances and individual goals. shared decision making, as part of\n nhc comments on aco proposed rule october 16, 2018 page 6 of 6\n treatment plans that align with the individual\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s goals, is a foundational component of high- quality patient-centered care that should be reinforced with appropriate quality measures. the nhc urges cms to further engage patients and patient advocacy organizations to develop or identify measures that reflect quality care for individuals with chronic conditions and that can be utilized across programs.\n\n conclusion\n the nhc appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed rule. we continue to support cms in its efforts to ensure the medicare shared savings program meets the intended objectives of improving quality of care while reducing costs. please do not hesitate to contact eric gascho, our vice president of policy and government affairs, if you or your staff would like to discuss these issues in greater detail. he is reachable by phone at 202-973-0545 for via email at

washington, dc 20201\n re: cms proposed rule: medicare program: medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success (cms-1701-p)\n dear administrator verma,\n the american college of cardiology (acc) appreciates the opportunity to provide input on the cms proposed rule: medicare program: medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success (cms- 1701-p).\n the acc envisions a world where innovation and knowledge optimize cardiovascular care and outcomes. as the professional home for the entire cardiovascular care team, the mission of the college and its more than 52,000 members is to transform cardiovascular care and to improve heart health. the acc bestows credentials upon cardiovascular professionals who meet stringent qualifications and leads in the formation of health policy, standards and guidelines. the college also provides professional medical education, disseminates cardiovascular research through its world-renowned jacc journals, operates national registries to measure and improve care, and offers cardiovascular accreditation to hospitals and institutions.\n general comments:\n\n\n value-based transformation in his speech before the federation of american hospitals: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is no turning back to an unsustainable system that pays for procedures rather than value.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n acc believes that in refining the mssp, acos should reflect the appropriate patient populations and provide a complete picture of care provided by all clinicians involved, including specialist clinicians.\n in this letter, acc is offering detailed comments related to the basic and enhanced participation tracks, benchmarking methodology, waivers and beneficiary incentives, and aco and standalone part d plan collaboration.\n basic and enhanced participation tracks:\n under the proposed rule, eligible acos would enter an agreement period of not less than five years and be able to choose from two tracks. a \"basic\" track would act as a glide path and allow acos to begin under a one-sided model and incrementally phase-in higher levels of risk (referred to as levels a through e) that, at the highest, level e, would qualify as an advanced alternative payment model (apm) under the quality payment program. notably, the shared savings rate for the first two years of an agreement period in the basic track (levels a and b) is set at 25 percent while the current mssp track 1 is set at a 50 percent shared savings rate.\n the enhanced track has a higher level of risk sharing than what is offered in the basic glide path and allows acos to qualify as an advanced apm immediately. acos in the enhanced track will bear the same level of risk throughout the five-year agreement period, in an arrangement that mirrors the current mssp track 3.\n acc believes that the pathway for success as proposed should be refined to provide more appropriate levels of risk and shared savings for participating acos. the college is strongly concerned that the rapid assumption of significant levels of risk by acos will discourage new participants and impede current mssp acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to make patient- centered infrastructure investments that are necessary for successful participation.\n considering the rule as proposed, acc asks cms to provide technical assistance for physician-led acos that may not have robust actuarial and analytics capacity and experience with downside risk. lack of such assistance places physician-led acos at a significant disadvantage compared to larger hospital-led acos that are more likely to have advanced actuarial and analytics capacities.\n 50 percent shared savings rate for basic track levels a and b\n\n\n successful participation. providing high value patient care requires large capital expenditures. acc is concerned that the 25 percent will deter participants from making the investments necessary for successful participation in both one-sided and progressively two-sided financial risk tracks. this is especially the case as physician practices and health systems contend with often conflicting incentives of having a subset of the medicare fee-for-service patients in an aco while the remainder are in a purely fee-for-service reimbursement structure.\n cms should ensure that the mssp remains a viable participation option for physician practices and health systems providing high value patient care. a 50 percent shared savings rate will ensure they receive adequate credit for the infrastructure investments made to optimize patient care.\n allow successful acos to remain in non-risk bearing arrangements longer\n acc supports allowing acos to stay in a non-risk bearing agreement longer than the two years that cms proposes. the 2017 mssp results confirm that aco performance improves with longer participation in the program. for acos inexperienced with risk, aco participation requires significant investment in clinical practice transformation and quality measurement and data reporting capabilities. savings derived from those investments are realized over the lifetime of the aco, not necessarily in the first or second year of the performance period. providing a longer window for successful acos to continue in the program and achieve a reasonable return on their investment will encourage broader upfront adoption, incentivize better performance, and encourage greater long-term returns by retaining high performing cardiologists.\n an alternative that could be adopted is continuation in a non-risk bearing agreement (i.e., for either early participants or small and mid-size acos) that is dependent on demonstrable progress. for example, criteria for remaining in mssp one-sided risk could include factors such as: a) generating savings, but falling short of the shared savings threshold, b) steady improvements in quality and/or costs, or c) evidence of structural investments (e.g., population health analytics, care management, clinical integration governance and management, etc.).\n glide path for financial risk between the basic and enhanced tracks\n the change from 4 percent risk in basic level e to 15 percent in the enhanced track is a significant  increase  and  may  present  a  barrier  to  successful  participation  by  smaller  and  less experienced acos. acc is concerned that acos may choose to leave the program rather than transition to the enhanced track in their second agreement period due to the large increase in two-sided risk. the college recommends that cms consider refining the ehanced track with a two-sided risk glide path similar to the basic  track. for instance, year 1 of the enhanced track could contain a level of 7 percent two-sided risk, move to 10 percent in year 2, and then 15 percent in years 3, 4, and 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n benchmarking methodology:\n risk adjustment\n cms proposes modifications in the risk adjustment methodology to account for changes in case mix and severity of assigned beneficiaries and eliminate the distinction between continuously and newly aligned beneficiaries. the college strongly supports eliminating that distinction.\n cms proposes to cap the risk score growth at +/-3 percent of the risk score for benchmark year 3. the  college  is  concerned  that in capping  the  growth  in  risk  scores  for  a  defined  attributed population,  risk  adjustment  in  performance  benchmarks  is  not  reflective  of  the  population  a physician practice or health system is managing on a year to year basis. this discrepancy could contribute  to  adverse  incentives  for  program  participants  and  encourage adverse  selection  of patients. acc recommends that cms raise the cap to at least +/-5 percent to more accurately account for changes in relative patient risk over a five-year performance period.\n regional factors\n cms proposes to incorporate regional factors when establishing the benchmark as part of the first agreement  period,  as  well  as  for  updating  the  benchmark. the  college  is  supportive  of  this proposal. as  a  refinement  to  the  proposal,  acc  recommends  that  cms remove  aco beneficiaries from the regional comparison group.\n waivers and beneficiary incentives:\n the acc strongly believes that high value patient care is dependent upon clinicians having the tools to appropriately manage the care of a defined patient population. the college appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to implement the following flexibilities in care coordination and offers comments on refining the proposals. where statutorily permissible, acc recommends that cms allow waivers and beneficiary incentives to be adopted across the spectrum of acos, including those in one-sided risk arrangements.\n attribution\n cms proposes that all acos can select between retrospective or prospective attribution at the start of  each  agreement  period,  as  well  as  the  option  to  change  that  selection  for  each  subsequent performance  year. the  college  strongly  supports  this  added flexibility  for  mssp  acos. having the option of prospective attribution will allow acos to better manage their patient populations and tailor clinical practice transformation efforts to their patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 health care needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n beneficiary assignment\n cms proposes allowing beneficiaries to designate a physician regardless of specialty or a nurse practitioner, physician assistant or clinical nurse specialist as their \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary clinician\u00e2\u0080\u009d responsible for coordinating their overall care. the college strongly supports this proposal and appreciates cms  recognizing  the  diversity  in  care  settings  and  clinicians  from  which  a  patient  may receive care. this added flexibility will allow patients to designate as their \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary clinician\u00e2\u0080\u009d a specialist clinician that may already be responsible for the majority of the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care such as cardiologists.\n to inform future work on care coordination across the continuum of primary care clinicians and specialist clinicians, acc recommends  that cms review the  november 2017 jama cardiology article entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cpayment reform to enhance collaboration of primary care and cardiology: a review.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  this article resulted from an in-person meeting held in january 2016 where acc collaborated with the duke-margolis center for health policy with a group of member participants along with representatives from primary care organizations, payer, cmmi, and health system leaders. table 1 of the article outlines five models of care under a collaborative management framework between cardiology and primary care. the college would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this work further with cms.\n telehealth\n cms proposes that beginning in 2020, acos in any two-sided risk arrangement with prospective assignment will be reimbursed for telehealth services. the college encourages cms to interpret this  provision  of  the  fy  2018  bipartisan  budget  act  as  allowing  for  telehealth reimbursement  for  acos  in  two-sided  arrangements  prospective  assignment  with retrospective reconciliation, which will allow more acos to utilize this important waiver.\n skilled nursing facility (snf) three-day waiver\n cms proposes that acos in any two-sided arrangement will be eligible to use the snf three-day waiver. this waives medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rule that a beneficiary must have a three-day inpatient stay before medicare will reimburse for a snf stay. the college encourages cms to make this important care coordination flexibility available to all mssp acos, including those in one-side risk arrangements.\n beneficiary incentives\n cms proposes that acos in a two-sided arrangement can create a beneficiary incentive program, paying  an  assigned  beneficiary  up  to  $20  per  qualifying primary  care  service  received. the college strongly supports this flexibility in patient care management and appreciates cms implementing an important provision of the fy 2018 bipartisan budget act.\n\n\n\n\n\n aco and standalone part d plan collaboration:\n cms seeks comment on how mssp acos and the sponsors of standalone part d prescription drug plans (pdps) could be encouraged to collaborate to improve the coordination of pharmacy care for medicare beneficiaries. the college supports affordable access for all patients to all approved prescription drugs with scientific evidence of net clinical benefit or as articulated in clinical practice guidelines. cms should ensure that patient access is not impeded through any  collaborative  arrangement  between  an  aco  and  a pdp. specifically,  cms  should exercise caution regarding the use of prior authorization or other utilization review tools in such an arrangement.\n conclusion:\n acc is committed to working with cms and providers to enable success in the medicare shared savings program and the overall value-based payment environment.  the college looks forward to ongoing discussion and collaboration with cms in creating opportunities for cardiologists and the cardiovascular team to participate in the medicare shared savings program and other alternative payment model initiatives.\n if you have any questions or would like additional information regarding any recommendations in this letter,

population. we offer effective solutions for the most chronically-ill and medically complex patients \u00e2\u0080\u0093 those 10 percent of patients that consume 60 percent of medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s costs. additionally, we are committed to delivering innovative solutions through expanded care management capabilities across an integrated post-acute care (pac) network, data-driven insights, and 24/7 direct consumer assistance and support.  this includes kindred healthcare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation in accountable care organizations, bundled payments, and value-based purchasing programs.\n studies  demonstrate  that inpatient  rehabilitation  facilities  (irfs)  and  long-term  care  hospitals (ltchs) create optimal outcomes for the most difficult to treat patients, and thus, kindred healthcare believes  that  they play  an  essential  role  in  a  successful  medicare  shared saving  program  (mssp) accountable  care  organizations (acos).   kindred  healthcare is  the  leading  provider  of  specialized healthcare  to  clinically  complex  patients  in  nearly  2,500  hospitals  and  post-acute  care  facilities  in  45 states.  we  are  the  premier  provider  of  rehabilitation  and  critically  complex  care, delivered  in our 75 long-term care hospitals, 19 free-standing inpatient rehabilitation facilities, 99 hospital-based acute rehabilitation units, and through contract rehabilitation services in nearly 1,700 unaffiliated post-acute locations.\n kindred  encourages the  centers for  medicare  and  medicaid  services  (cms)  to  consider  additional pricing and regulatory flexibility for irfs and ltchs to allow them to effectively participate in alternate payment models.  below are more details regarding the additional waivers cms could grant which would furnish these providers with the necessary flexibility to respond to innovative payment designs and could present a stepping stone toward achieving a unified post-acute care payment system.\n\nii. expand payment flexibility \n cms has encouraged post-acute care providers to participate in alternative payment models (apms) such as  acos.  however,  medicare  reimbursement  for inpatient rehabilitation facilities and  long-term  care hospital  services  is  very  rigid,  with  a  fixed  per-patient  discharge  prospective  payment  system  based largely on factors outside of the hospital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control. in contrast, other pac providers have a greater degree of control over their medicare costs, namely through reducing their \u00e2\u0080\u009cunits\u00e2\u0080\u009d of utilization in either a per diem  payment  system  (nursing  homes)  or  a  fixed-length  episodic  payment  system  (home  health). although irfs and ltchs are encouraged to collaborate with acos on delivering efficient medicare spending, they are not given sufficient flexibility to adjust the costs associated with the resources used. to  facilitate  innovation  of  care delivery,  cms  should  grant acos  and  bundle  holders  more flexibility to negotiate market-based payment arrangements with irfs and ltchs so that patients that are treated under alternative payment models have continued access to quality care in settings that their treating physicians require.  otherwise, what should be clinical decisions will be made for purely  financial  reasons  because  under  the  current  system  acos  and  bundle-holders  are constrained by an inelastic medicare fee structure that effectively prices them out of apms.\n 3 | p a g e\n cases. in addition, flexibility would be provided to further reduce spending by lowering lengths of stay (los) by incorporating a per-diem payment method for shorted than average stay patients.\niii. expand regulatory waivers   \n in addition to pricing flexibility, cms clearly retains the regulatory authority to waive some or all of the restrictive  requirements  in  the  context  of  these  models,  and  have  made  similar  concessions  for  other providers. although cms waived the significant and well-established snf three-day stay rule, the agency should go further and also waive certain regulatory requirements that must be relaxed to facilitate patient access to irf and ltchs under the mssp.\n accordingly, various regulatory requirements should be waived in the context of specific apms to allow irfs and ltchs to more effectively participate. currently, existing conditions of participation restrict fair competition across pac providers. one example is the three hour therapy rule for irfs. according to the three hour therapy rule, medicare requires that at the time of admission, the patient must receive and benefit from  three  hours  of  therapy  per day  for  at  least five  days  per  week.    if  patients  are  unable  to tolerate three hours of therapy for five days each week, they would not qualify for irf payments. another example is that irfs and ltchs are required to have higher staffing ratios with more frequent patient contact by physicians than other pac settings. in addition, irfs and ltchs must meet stringent federal hospital  conditions  of  participation,  among  other  strict  federal  and  state  hospital  licensing  and  other regulatory requirements.\n cms also restricts the proportion of patients with certain clinical conditions (i.e., the irf \u00e2\u0080\u009c60% rule\u00e2\u0080\u009d) or level of clinical severity as measured by average hospital length of stay (i.e., the ltch 25 day average length of stay rule).  waiving these regulatory restrictions will furnish acos and bundle-holders with additional flexibility to treat patients in the most clinically appropriate and cost-effective setting for the appropriate length of time.  with the appropriate reporting requirements and financial incentives in place to ensure high quality clinically appropriate care, these regulatory restrictions are unnecessary and impede the  ability of providers to fully innovate  or reform health delivery systems.   if left unaddressed,  these regulatory differences have the potential to negatively impact patient referral patterns and patient access to clinically appropriate care in certain types of settings as well as restrict fair competition across pac providers.\n these approaches are consistent with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recent emphasis on expanding provider access to apms, and has been favorably discussed by medpac in the context of reforming and advancing medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post- acute  care  payment  systems.  cms  has  the  authority  to  permit  such  flexibility,  and  to  waive  these bureaucratic requirements without congressional approval; the agency should do so when promulgating any future models or changes to the current programs.\n\niv. conclusion \n\n 4 | p a g e\n congressional approval; the agency should do so when promulgating any future models or changes

2018\n dear administrator verma:\n on behalf of our more than 400 hospitals and health systems, the california hospital association (cha) appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) proposed rule outlining changes to the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\n cha appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued engagement of stakeholders on its new direction for the center for medicare & medicaid innovation (cmmi) and the development of new alternative payment models (apms). in addition, cha is pleased that cmmi has demonstrated its commitment to engagement through stakeholder meetings \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as the behavioral health payment and care delivery summit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and continued support of the health care payment learning and action network. we look forward to more of this engagement in large and small group settings. more importantly, we look forward to the outcomes of those activities in advancing new payment models that continue to transform our health care delivery system.\n in reviewing the proposed changes to the mssp \u00e2\u0080\u0094 effective january 1, 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 cha is guided by a number of principles that our members believe are critically important in new model design. for example, cha supports a focus on voluntary models that reduce burdensome requirements and unnecessary regulations, allowing providers to focus on providing high-quality, patient-centered care. cha is concerned that a number of the proposed changes will only further divide the field, rather than encourage collaboration, by significantly disadvantaging hospital participation in this program. we urge cms to reconsider a number of provisions going forward, and we look forward to continued dialogue.\n these guiding principles inform our more detailed comments noted below.\n guiding principle: cha supports a phased approach to financial risk that recognizes the significant investment risks associated with the development of apms in the early years of implementation.\n cms administrator seema verma october 16, 2018\n\n page 2 approach that allows operational changes to take place over time. unfortunately, cms continues to underestimate the significant upfront investment required of providers that develop and implement apms. overcoming this challenge is particularly difficult in a state like california, which has an incredibly complex health care marketplace with some of the most onerous health care regulations in the country. to develop the clinical and operational infrastructures necessary to better manage patient care, california hospitals and health systems must invest substantial time, energy and resources. an analysis by the american hospital association estimated start-up costs of $11.6 million for a small accountable care organization (aco) and $26.1 million for a medium aco. our health systems in california note that these costs remain exceedingly high, with one system estimating the startup costs for year one at over $7 million.\n cha supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow inexperienced re-entering and renewing acos, including those that are currently participating in track 1 of the mssp, an additional year of upside-only risk. however, we also urge the agency to allow new, inexperienced acos three years in upside-only risk, rather than two. requiring them to proceed to downside risk prior to the end of a three-year performance period is too soon.\n guiding principle: cha supports episode-based bundled payment models that recognize hospitals as the most appropriate initiator.\n we are deeply disappointed that several of the proposed changes make it harder for existing and new acos to participate in the program. moreover, a number of provisions significantly disadvantage and discourage participation in this program and, as such, the opportunities to advance our shared goals in health care transformation are stymied. more specifically, cha does not support the proposed differentiation between high- and low-revenue acos. cms should make significant revisions to improve the methodology to reward performance for improved quality and reduced costs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamental principles. in addition, we urge cms to maintain a 50 percent shared savings rate for all basic level acos.\n collectively, the provisions outlined in the proposed rule will limit participation by hospitals and health systems, including integrated health systems that are currently struggling to find additional efficiencies in an already efficient system. we believe strongly that hospitals are best equipped to lead other providers in moving toward downside risk. hospitals and health systems have provided \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and continue to provide \u00e2\u0080\u0094significant infrastructure support related to health information technology, regulatory compliance and other administrative functions that are key to successful apm implementation. in addition, hospitals are experienced in the necessary patient and family engagement and discharge planning programs through which to achieve efficiencies under these models. hospitals take the financial responsibility for an episode of care seriously, and are committed to working collaboratively with physicians and post-acute care providers under new models to improve the quality and efficiency of care.\n guiding principle: cha supports the development of apm methodologies that allow california hospitals to build on experience with capitation under managed care.\n cms administrator seema verma october 16, 2018\n\n page 3 largely managed care market. while it makes sense to have a regional blend of data for some areas of the country, there are many areas in california where additional efficiencies cannot be realized. california\u00e2\u0080\u0099s providers are at a significant disadvantage under this program due to the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historically low spending growth, compared to other areas of the country. as such, we urge cms to consider a number of changes for markets with providers that wish to participate in the mssp, but are at a significant disadvantage compared to other areas of the country.\n cha supports a number of changes to the benchmark methodology, including increasing the proposed 3 percent symmetrical cap on risk scores and applying the increased cap on a year-over-year basis rather than over the entire agreement period. in addition, we urge cms not to finalize the proposal to use the full 12 months of calendar year 2019 to determine the benchmark and assigned beneficiary expenditures for acos that participate in one or both of the 2019 six-month performance periods.\n guiding principle: cha supports removal of legal and regulatory barriers to clinical integration, as well as modifications and waivers to medicare policies that deny hospitals the flexibility to provide the most efficient and clinically appropriate care.\n cha applauds the administration for its work to date under its patients over paperwork initiative and active solicitation of stakeholder feedback on changes to both the stark law and anti-kickback laws through two separate requests for information. we urge the agency to continue to find additional opportunities under the mssp to remove unnecessary barriers in care delivery and care transitions. both federal and california state law create serious barriers to clinical integration, which is essential to creating efficiencies and improving care under apms. clinical integration depends on hospitals, doctors, nurses and other caregivers working as a team to ensure that patients get the right care, at the right time, in the right place. shared savings and gainsharing provide important mechanisms for aligning providers' interests to decrease health care costs while improving quality, as the health care industry transitions from volume- to value-based payment.\n therefore, cha supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposals to expand access to the three-day waiver for skilled-nursing facility and telehealth coverage under the mssp. cha urges cms to look for additional opportunities to further streamline care delivery for our beneficiaries. in california, state law poses a significant challenge to aligning incentives. therefore, it is incredibly important to ensure federal flexibility. the cost of doing business is increased by the need for complex business agreements to appropriately navigate a complex regulatory framework. these costs should be avoided.\n we urge cms to consider additional waivers, including those related to hospital discharge planning requirements and inpatient rehabilitation rules, as noted below.\n hospital discharge planning requirements current hospital discharge planning requirements that prohibit, or otherwise limit, information hospitals may provide on post-hospital services inhibit efficient care coordination. cha urges cms to waive these requirements in models that hold participating hospitals financially accountable for quality and costs for the entire episode of care, so that the hospital has the flexibility to direct patients to the most clinically appropriate next setting of care.\n\n cms administrator seema verma october 16, 2018\n\n page 4 inpatient rehabilitation facility 60 percent and three-hour rules the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system \u00e2\u0080\u009c60 percent rule\u00e2\u0080\u009d requires that at least 60 percent of a facility\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patients (medicare and non-medicare) have conditions or diagnoses that fall within a list of 13 specific diagnostic categories, either as a primary diagnosis or as a qualifying comorbidity. given that the design of certain apms is expected to decrease the volume of patients referred to these facilities, cha urges cms to consider waiving this requirement. in addition, under models that include a voluntary per-diem type of payment method, the three-hour requirement for therapy should also be waived.\n cha appreciates the opportunity to provide cms with our comments. if you have any questions, please contact me at akeefe@calhospital.org or (202) 488-4688.\n

improve communication and coordination between acos and snfs: we believe that acos will achieve better quality, financial, and patient outcomes with improved communication and coordination with snfs.

for snf utilization and select quality measures that are data-driven, impactful, and aligned across payers.\n\n below, we provide more in-depth and specific recommendations related to each of the overarching points, above.\n\n specific recommendations\n snf 3-day waiver\n cms proposes to allow the use of the snf 3-day waiver for any aco in a downside risk track of the basic track or the enhanced track, regardless of beneficiary assignment methodology. cms also proposes to allow critical access hospitals (cahs) and rural hospitals operating under a swing bed arrangement to be eligible for the snf 3-day waiver. ahca supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 decision to provide greater access to the waiver.\n however, we believe there are also opportunities for further improvement.\n\n ahca recommends that cms allow snfs to apply for and \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3own\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 the waiver, rather than requiring that acos apply for and maintain the waiver. we believe this will reduce confusion and administrative burden for acos, snf affiliates and the beneficiaries they serve. the 3-day waiver is important because it allows patients to receive the appropriate level of care at the right time, and we believe this will increase access to and use of the waiver.\n\n ahca recommends that cms allow waiver access to all aco tracks, irrespective of risk. any medicare beneficiary assigned to an aco should automatically be afforded the ability to waive the 3-day stay requirement. we believe it is important for all patients, regardless of their assignment to a risk-bearing or non-risk-bearing aco, to have the opportunity to avoid unnecessary time in the hospital and receive appropriate care. in\n addition, by allowing more providers to use the waiver, unnecessary costs to the healthcare system will be reduced. the snf 3-day requirement is an outdated regulatory burden which increases health care spending and reduces quality of care. as stated above, we believe this waiver allows patients to receive care in the most appropriate setting, resulting in cost reductions from eliminating or reducing hospital stays preceding snf admissions and should therefore be granted to more providers in effort to improve overall quality of care.\n\n ahca also requests that cms create equal eligibility requirements for all snfs, cahs, and rural hospitals with a swing bed arrangement. first, we believe that if cahs participate in the waiver, a 3-star requirement should apply, like the 3-star requirement for snfs. alternatively, if no comparable cah rating system exists, cms should limit cah use of the waiver to only those cahs truly located in rural areas experiencing snf access issues. the intent of the cah certification is to ensure access to care in rural communities. as such, cahs must meet two location-related requirements: 1) they must be located at least a certain distance from hospitals and other cahs; and 2) they must be located in rural areas. however, according to a recent department of health and human services office of inspector general report, nearly two-thirds of cahs would not meet the rural location requirements if required to re- enroll.! it is important to provide equal and fair assessment to all facilities and to have an appropriate quality standard in place. to that end, ahca also urges cms to re-evaluate the appropriateness of the 3-star requirement for waiver eligibility. second, we believe that the star rating system does not provide a comprehensive representation of snf quality and should not be the sole requirement for snf waiver eligibility. cms should implement an exceptions process for snfs who temporarily drop below 3 stars so they can continue to utilize the waiver. many of our member snfs have dropped below 3 stars at some point due to technical issues with the ratings requirements and not because of change quality performance. it is also essential that cms address the appropriateness of 3-star threshold when future changes are made to the star rating system that follow the publication of the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3pathways to success\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 final rule.\n\n in addition, while the star rating system incorporates risk adjustment for the individual metrics involved in the star rating system, no adjustment is applied to the weight of long stay and short stay quality measures when calculating a quality rating. short stay measures and long stay measures are weighted equally, even if a facility has considerably more medicaid long stay volume. this has led to inequality among providers that have higher long stay volume than short stay volume. for mssp acos, an accurate depiction of short stay quality is particularly important. a recent analysis also found that \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3there can be no nationally consistent process for assigning star ratings, since the most significant contributors to the ratings are the state-level inspections, which are conducted by separate sets of inspectors within each state, using protocols for which there is no national\n\n\n\n1u.s. department of health and human services office of inspector general.

(ccsq) to take these issues into consideration when revising the star rating system so that medicare payers, beneficiaries, and upstream and downstream providers are provided with accurate information about snf quality.\n\n creating flexibility within the criteria for snfs will allow snfs that provide high-quality care to benefit from the waiver. in addition, an improved rating system will avoid the penalization of snfs that provide high-quality care but are subject to an inaccurate or insignificant drop in star ratings that have no relation to quality and patient outcomes.\n\n ahca appreciates cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 continued refinements of the snf 3-day waiver in the shared savings program and believes that this waiver, with the appropriate access and requirements, will have an even more meaningful impact on the quality and costs of care.\n\n aco transition to risk clinical guidelines\n cms proposes to replace mssp tracks | and 2 with the new basic track, which would require downside risk beginning in year three. mssp track 3 would be replaced by the new enhanced track but maintain the same risk requirements. ahca supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 decision to require acos to transition to downside risk and cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 broad goal to transition more providers to downside risk. however, as acos transition to risk and drive cost reduction strategies, providers across different care settings must discuss and coordinate clinical guidelines to ensure appropriate patient care. we have heard from countless members that many acos simply require snfs to reduce length-of-stay (los)\n and if facilities do not meet acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 demands, snfs will be removed from the post-acute network, regardless of patient outcomes or potential rehospitalizations. as such, we believe there should be guidelines on los requirements for different types of patients in the snf. premature discharges can result in rehospitalizations, worse patient outcomes, and increased costs to the system, which should be avoided. therefore, we urge cms to: (1) monitor snf utilization by acos and the associated impact on rehospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality; and (2) create formal guidelines on appropriate care protocols and los requirements for aco patients in the snf.\n specifically, cms should point out to acos medicare beneficiaries have the right to a statutorily defined snf benefit found at 42 u.s. code \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 1395i\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b63, requirements for, and assuring quality of care in, skilled nursing facilities. while we respect the need to develop new approaches to efficiency in medicare, beneficiary rights and access to quality care should be a core element to any cms program or demonstration.\n\n financial gainsharing\n\n\n > fuller r. the need to validly compare nursing home quality across state lines. 3m health care inside angle. published august 24, 2018.\n\n ahca is supportive of the transition to risk, but as acos assume risk, we believe that cms should encourage the use of gainsharing and other financial arrangements between acos and downstream providers. as cms has noted, acos achieve financial savings largely because of reduced snf spending. however, snfs experience aggressive aco actions, including the dictation of medical practice, required reductions in los, and other interferences with snf operations. as such, to reward snf behavior and cooperation with acos, we believe acos should compensate snfs in keeping with proportion of savings snfs achieve for acos while maintaining quality outcomes. we recommend that cms create gainsharing guidelines for acos and snfs, whereby snfs receive financial benefit from improved outcomes and aco savings. ahca believes it is important to create the proper financial incentives for acos and their downstream partners, so providers are properly rewarded for efficient and effective care. with the proper incentives in place for acos and downstream providers, we believe cms would create incentives for acos in the shared savings program to work with snfs in order to achieve medicare savings and quality rather than using inappropriate utilization controls discussed above. in regard, gainsharing guidelines could reinforce the use of best practices and clinical practice guidelines (e.g., medication assessment and reconciliation).\n\n of serious concern, some of our members have entered into financial agreements with acos and worked to improve patient care and reduce costs, often by putting significant dollars at risk. however, in some cases, acos have violated the terms of these contracts and providers have no avenue to voice and/or address these violations without fear of retaliation. providers have indicated a broad-reaching fear any legal action will result in termination of contracts or loss of preferred provider status. we request that cms add a provision to the mssp regulations at 42 cfr \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 425.116(b) to protect the right of aco providers/suppliers to take remedial action against an aco for violating contractual obligations related to the care of mssp beneficiaries. providers must have access to meaningful avenues to communicate questions, concerns, or violations. in addition, we believe cms should incorporate provider satisfaction metrics in their evaluation of acos.\n\n apm safeguards\n the shift from ffs to apms and managed care has revealed a myriad of challenges for providers and beneficiaries, creating significant barriers to beneficiary access and choice.\n as acos and other alternative payment models (apms) transition to risk, we believe cms must ensure patient access, provider flexibility, and coordination of services. as such, ahca recommends that cms consider the following apm safeguards in future aco and apm refinement and development:\n\n\n1. the model must place the medical management of post-acute care with post-acute\n care providers;\n\n2. the model must preserve a patient\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s freedom of choice of provider;\n\n the model must not restrict guaranteed medicare benefits to medicare beneficiaries;\n\n4. the model must allow providers the flexibility to deliver patient-centered care (e.g.,\n improving the current 3-star requirement for the snf 3-day waiver) in order to achieve the patient\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s highest practicable level of function and outcome;\n ww\n\n5. the model must not inadvertently create access barriers for patients with complex or\n chronic diseases; and\n\n6. model savings should come from more efficient delivery of services and care\n coordination, rather than from summarily truncating lengths of stay or shifting the site of care.\n\n ahca requests that cms take the above apm safeguards into consideration when refining acos and other apms. we believe these safeguards will improve patient access, care coordination, and quality outcomes.\n\n beneficiary assignment\n cms proposes to remove the exclusion of claims including the pos code 31 for the aco assignment methodology and instead exclude services billed under cpt codes 99304 \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 99318 when these services are furnished in a snf based on an analysis of facility-level claims data. ahca commends cms for this proposed change and believes this will result in improved patient attribution.\n\n however, our members are concerned that acos often do not provide snfs with information about attributed aco beneficiaries when entering the nursing facility. as a result, this can lead to disjointed care, poor patient experience, and unnecessary burden on the snf. some of our member snfs have been forced to bear the full financial cost of a beneficiary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s snf stay due to incorrect information provided to them by the aco.\n ahca recommends that cms require acos to enhance communication and interoperability of electronic health records with snfs. we believe that improving the dissemination of electronic health records among providers will result in improved coordination of services and reduced inefficiencies as patients transition from one care setting to another. this communication must occur in a timely fashion, often in real time, to provide necessary care to aco beneficiaries. recently, cms highlighted its commitment to improving interoperability in the healthcare system, so we believe our recommendation for acos to share electronic health information with snfs aligns with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 goal of improved interoperability and will result in improved services.\n\n benchmark formation\n cms proposes to incorporate regional fee-for-service (ffs) expenditures when establishing an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s historical benchmark in the first agreement period. in addition, cms proposes to reduce the weight of regional adjustments from 70% to 50% and cap the regional adjustment by a flat dollar amount equal to 5% of national medicare ffs per capita expenditures. furthermore, cms proposes to use the cms-hcc prospective risk scores to adjust the historical benchmark based on changes in severity and case mix for all assigned beneficiaries, subject to a 3% positive or negative symmetrical cap for all agreement periods beginning july 1, 2019.\n\n ahca supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to incorporate regional expenditures into acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 historical benchmarks, however, ahca is concerned with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 methodology to calculate hcc risk scores. specifically, we are concerned with the fact that hcc scores\n do not accurately predict spending or utilization in snfs. because snfs have such a large role in the shared savings program, we recommend that cms refine its hcc risk adjustment methodology to account for the unique characteristics and needs of the snf population. a key to success in the shared savings program is accurate and reliable financial benchmarks, which is why it is vital to improve the methodology and ensure accurate and stable benchmarks. we believe a risk adjustment methodology that takes this into consideration will ultimately aide in the formation of a fair and reliable aco benchmark.\n\n quality measures\n cms seeks comments on quality measures per the meaningful measures initiative.\n within the current mssp measure set, ahca supports the continuation of the pneumococcal vaccination quality measure. in addition, as cms refines the mssp measure set, we believe that regardless of which quality measures are used, the following principles should be considered for quality measure selection. specifically, quality measures need:\n\n\n1. to reflect the primary goals of care for the population receiving care;\n\n\n2. to be meaningful to the consumer and provider;\n\n\n3. to be more heavily weighted for patient outcome measures than structure or process\n measures, particularly when used in p4p of vbp programs;\n\n4. to be risk adjusted to account for differences in patient populations and acuity\n (preferably by use of regression modeling not just through a set of exclusions);\n\n5. to use structure and process measures (if outcome measures are not available) that\n have an association with improved outcomes;\n\n6. to help achieve better outcomes (e.g., results reflect recent care delivery and can be\n used in quality improvement efforts such as qapi);\n\n7. to be readily available for use now or are under development to be used in the near\n future; and\n 8. to be based on data and measure specifications that are in the public domain.\n\n furthermore, beyond principles for quality measure selection, we believe quality measures should also reflect goals of care. as such, we recommend that cms consider the following goals when selecting quality measures for the mssp:\n\n\n1. return patients to their prior living situation or the most independent and least\n institutional setting practical as quickly as possible;\n\n2. avoid unnecessary rehospitalizations;\n\n\n3. improve patient function, particularly related to mobility, self-care (e.g., activities of\n daily living, or adls), and speech;\n\n4. improve patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 clinical conditions (e.g., wound healing, post-surgical recovery,\n\netc.);\n\n\n5. complete patient course of treatment for an episode of illness that requires skilled\n nursing care (e.g., [v medications such as antibiotics); and\n\n6. educate beneficiaries on how to better manage chronic disease(s) or disability (e.g.,\n transitioning to successful self- administration of medications)\n\n finally, we recognize the need to ensure that quality measures are built on the same criteria across payers and providers to avoid different kinds of rehospitalization measures and other quality measures, which result in provider confusion. accordingly, we urge cms to ensure quality measure alignment across payers. we believe quality measure alignment will allow providers to more easily manage quality measure performance and achieve high quality scores across different models and programs, while reducing administrative burden and costs.\n\n we applaud cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 commitment to the shared savings program and the continued refinement of various program components. in addition, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the mssp \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3pathways to success\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 proposed rule.\n\n if you have questions about any of our comments,

shared savings program (mssp) beneficiary assignment regulations, an np is an authorized aco professional, but their patients cannot be assigned to the aco unless they receive one primary care service from a primary care physician participating with the aco each year. this has inhibited np practices from joining or establishing shared savings aco's and limited the scope of the shared savings program (mssp). if the mssp is to continue to develop and improve patient access, quality and cost effectiveness, it must be fully inclusive of nps and their patients.\r\n\r\ntherefore, i support cms' proposal to update the voluntary alignment option for beneficiary assignment in the shared savings program (mssp). this proposal would allow a patient to choose an np as their primary shared savings

https://www.regulations.gov/comment?d=cms-2018-0101-0001\nre: medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success [cms-1701-p]\ndear administrator verma,\nthank you for the opportunity to provide comments regarding the recent centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) proposed \"pathways to success\" rule on the medicare shared savings program.\n\nthe mainehealth accountable care organization (mhaco) is one of the first medicare shared savings programs that started in july 2012.  we are deeply committed to the achievement of the quadruple aim and superior care of our medicare beneficiaries.   mhaco is an integrated system comprised of 10 hospitals (including maine medical center, an academic medical center based in portland, maine), nearly 1600 providers (including mainehealth employed plus private practitioners) across 380 practice sites (including 11 rural health centers and 2 fqhcs).  we manage over 230,000 lives across 14 distinct value based agreements including mssp with 55,000 attributed beneficiaries.\nfirst and foremost, let me acknowledge the hard work and thoughtfulness that clearly went into the recent \u00e2\u0080\u009cpathways to success\u00e2\u0080\u009d proposed rule.  it is evident that you seek to create program stability while you desire to achieve even greater outcomes in the program in a more rapid timeframe.  the proposal has a number of positive elements, yet there are some areas of significant concern.  i will highlight the elements that are most important to mhaco within this letter.\nelements of pathways to success which we support:\nthe gradual glide path to risk, including the inclusion of the former track 1+ model\nreduction of quality measure requirements, in particular the elimination of aco #11 in favor of an attestation at the aco level (provided this aligns with mips/apm)\nthe flexibility to select either retrospective or prospective attribution\nelements of pathways to success with significant concern:\nsharp reduction in shared savings opportunity from 50% to 25%:\nshared savings for hospital/health system acos have been much lower than physician-only acos, in part because of the complexities of attribution within a multi-specialty, multi hospital network.  thus, while health systems such as ours have had substantial revenue reductions due to efforts to reduce admissions, health systems have not been able to make that loss up in shared savings.  25% is not sufficient to incentivize participation as there will not be enough financial opportunity to reinvest in infrastructure- either at the practice level or at the system level.\nuntenable  jump from basic level e to enhanced track:\nmoving from a 4% of benchmark cap at basic level e to a 15% benchmark cap in the enhanced track in a single year means moving from an approximate $22m loss potential to an $83m loss potential.  for mhaco, this level of potential loss would preclude our participation due to unpredictable risk.  mhaco would support continued participation in level e by designing the program to assure certain quality marker achievement thereby demonstrating ongoing engagement in value based efforts.  additionally, we recommend alignment with qpp nominal risk standards of 3%.\nunwanted network bifurcation:  in order to survive under downside risk models, mhaco has been contemplating bifurcation of our network into employed vs private practice networks.  while a suboptimal approach, the primary reason to split up our network is that small private/independent practices cannot afford the financial penalties related to missed benchmarks. while this would be a necessary survival tactic, it would not be a favored strategic tactic because our approach for over 20 years is to have our network working together to improve and provide superior care for our beneficiaries- our community.  ironically, the costs to set up a bifurcated new network and aco entity are by no means trivial and ultimately would be absorbed by mhaco.\nunfair impact to  \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos\u00e2\u0080\u009d by pushing them to accelerated risk tracks:\nwe can appreciate the fact that some hospital system acos may have more access to funds to cover losses, however there are several reasons why cms should reconsider this approach:\nhospital impact:  hospitals already face significant reductions to cms reimbursement which amplifies the cost shifting to commercial payers, creating an access issue for the population under 65 years of age.  for example, cms recently proposed significant reductions to medicare payments in the outpatient rule.\nhospital/health system/aco impact:  together hospitals, health systems and acos can make huge investments in their communities.  specifically, not for profit hospital systems like mainehealth are committed to serving all people in their communities including the uninsured and underinsured.  we do not see the same commitment to community engagement and investment from other acos such as large physician-led acos that may be targeting communities with higher benchmarks where a positive roi is assured.   mhaco however is committed to serving the entire community of southern maine and has invested heavily to do so.  in addition to the hospital employed providers, we include many private providers in our aco, for both mssp and commercial value- based agreements because our philosophy is driven by the fact that it takes the entire provider community to provide the highest value care to our beneficiaries as well as to make the necessary strategic changes to achieve the quadruple aim.  for example, mhaco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment in community health includes:\nnearly 40 rns, lcsws, and medical assistants to support complex care management\nsignificant investment in a population health management tool to aggregate data across disparate systems to inform the care we provide our patients.  we have over 40 different ehrs to gather information for effective population health management\ndevelopment of detailed clinical models to support end of life and post-acute care\nengagement of nearly  1600 providers in healthcare transformation through in person meetings, value-oversight committees, constant communication tactics such as newsletters, webinars, dinners, 1:1 meetings\nperverse incentives:  our concern is that in the current environment if cms pushes to drive losses more quickly to hospitals,  it will be increasingly difficult for hospital systems to invest dollars back into  population health management activities for the community of providers that we engage in value- based activities - the very investments that are necessary for long term success of aco to meet the triple aim\nearly termination if exceeding benchmarks:\nthe provision to terminate acos if they exceed benchmarks is very worrisome as there are a multitude of reasons why acos may not make their benchmarks.  health systems/acos/providers would need 100% confidence in cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark methodology which has been significantly flawed to date.  understandably, the construct of the benchmark is complex and many acos do not have the skill set or actuarial support to analyze, review and assess the complexities of benchmarking.  mhaco advocates for  changes in the regional benchmarking methodology to include:\nreinstatement of the 70% regional blend (as opposed to the proposed 50% cap)\na regional comparison that consists of the fee for service population as our aco maine market drives the entire region.\nplan design:\nmhaco exists in a primarily fee for service environment where most health plan design does not require choosing a primary care physician.  while done in the name of \u00e2\u0080\u009cretaining patient choice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d this construct of plan design makes it challenging if not impossible at times to truly manage the population.  furthermore, there is no protection for the cost of new part b drugs and/or new technology.  all of these factors (lack of pcp selection, part b drug costs, technology expense) work against us in controlling costs and providing value.\nrisk adjustment caps at +/- 3%:\nmhaco is very supportive of the proposal to remove the distinction between continuously enrolled and newly assigned beneficiaries as it relates to application of the risk adjustment.  however, we object to an arbitrary cap on the risk as it fails to recognize the true risk of the population.  an alternative could be that an adjustment greater than 3% could trigger a coding audit so that cms has comfort that the adjustment was not a result of up-coding.  as you are aware, many acos are placing efforts on complete and accurate clinical documentation to enable our risk stratification and predictive modeling platforms and assure the right patients have access to care management resources and appropriate care.  we would not want to deter these important efforts.\nbeneficiary notification\nas a 2012 aco, we were originally required to send notification letters to all beneficiaries in order to receive claims data from cms.  the process was not only onerous, but it was also particularly confusing to the beneficiaries.  frankly, voluntary alignment and opt in letters are no different.  in keeping with hhs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal for administrative simplification, we advocate for pcp assignment but should that not be acceptable to cms, we would then prefer a claims-based attribution. simplicity is critical as it allows us to focus on our quality improvement and cost reduction strategies as opposed to compliance with complex administrative requirements.\n2019 six- month extension period:\nwe appreciate the ability to extend our current agreement through june 30, 2019 and recognize that many acos are anxious to move forward with a risk agreement.  however, we support a choice of either a six month or twelve month extension.  clearly, the six month extension results in additional administrative burden including two application periods, two efforts to re-contract our 130+ tax ids, and two reconciliations.  at minimum, we hope that there will be ample time to secure extensions to agreements for 2019 for those acos that have contract periods expiring as of december 31, 2018.\nfinally, we applaud cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to embrace the tenets of the aca and incent health systems and providers across the country to move toward value-based care.  furthermore, cms has recognized that there are inherent challenges with the current mssp model that must be modified and improved.  in response, acos such as ours have embraced the efforts of payment reform and remain deeply committed to investing for the future by financing millions of dollars as well as allocating significant system resources, people and operations to meet the goals of value- based care.  tremendous amounts of time and resources are placed toward educating, engaging and aligning our 1600 providers in the ways they can lead this transformation, care for patients better with fewer resources, and continue to excel in the quality of care they give to our beneficiaries.  please be aware that mainehealth works to provide care in an environment with low fee for service reimbursement from cms and no pmpm support for our activities such as population health management, complex care, and technology advances.  private payors on the other hand recognize the critical importance of such investments while cms fails to support.\nit has been remarkable and inspiring, particularly at national conferences like naacos, to witness the innovation, dedication, and fortitude that providers, leaders and health systems have channeled toward achieving success on behalf of cms and medicare beneficiaries under these new mssp programs.  we are all diligently working on health care transformation together, and it takes time, energy, and willingness to change when something does not work.  however the current assumption from cms that providers who are not taking downside risk are less accountable and/or less committed to change is frustrating and is leading to lower morale, further disengagement, and is hampering the spirit of innovation and culture of change which cms is working so diligently to incent.\nmhaco has spent years creating a value based culture, promoting accountability, engaging providers in the work and investing in infrastructure and technology to support finding success under mssp and to move to downside risk.  however, culture change takes time and infrastructure and technology need funding- especially across large networks in a rural state with disparate capabilities such as ours.  it would be unfortunate if the changes to the program that cms is contemplating forced acos to leave the program.   mhaco is concerned that fully implementing the current proposal will result in our own inability to continue with the program, force more acos to drop out, and disincentivize any new acos from forming which ultimately could result in negligible advancement of value-based care and improved outcomes for the medicare population.  mhaco strongly advocates for a pathways to success program that allows for the inclusion for as many providers and health systems as possible, supports program infrastructure, and follows the recommendations made above.\nin closing, on behalf of mainehealth system and mhaco, i greatly appreciate the opportunity to share comments and recommendations with you.  thank you for your work on behalf of our maine and new hampshire medicare beneficiaries and providers to advance value-based payments and improve health and wellness.  we appreciate your interest in sustaining the success of medicare acos.  the mainehealth aco  is fundamentally committed to the health and well-being of our medicare beneficiaries and supports healthcare transformation through innovation and reform by creating an environment where providers are encouraged to enter into value-based payment arrangements, programs are financially supported and patients receive high-quality, coordinated care at a lower cost.  it is our urgent request that you strongly consider our recommendations to improve the proposed pathways to success program so that we can continue on this journey together.\nsincerely,\nelizabeth h. johnson, md, ms\npresident & chief executive

faith-based, nonprofit health care systems, texas health resources (texas  health)  provides  more than  350  points  of  access throughout  north texas,  including  29 hospitals (acute-care, short-stay, behavioral health, rehabilitation and transitional care) and more than  100  outpatient  facilities,  satellite  emergency  rooms,  surgery  centers,  behavioral  health facilities, fitness centers and imaging centers. the system also includes a large physician group, home health, preventive and well-being services as well as more than 250 clinics and physician offices to provide the full continuum of care for all stages of life.  texas health appreciates the opportunity  to comment  on  the  centers  for  medicare and medicaid  services\u00e2\u0080\u0099  (cms) medicare shared savings program (mssp) pathways to success proposed rule.\n texas health appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued commitment to accountable care organizations (acos). medicare acos have been successful in reducing healthcare costs and improving quality.  the recent  mssp  pathways  to  success  proposed  rule  estimates  that  the  overall  impact  of  acos, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cspillover effects\u00e2\u0080\u009d on medicare spending outside of the aco program, lowered spending by  $1.8\u00e2\u0080\u0093$4.2  billion  (0.5\u00e2\u0080\u00931.2  percent)  in  2016  alone.  additionally,  when  assessing  the counterfactual, comparing acos performance in comparison to what medicare spending would have otherwise been, acos estimate savings are approximately 2 percent higher1.  for example, peer-reviewed studies found that the mssp saved more than $200 million in 2013 and 2014 and $144.6 million in 2015 after accounting for shared savings bonuses earned by acos2.  a similar study  found  that  acos  saved  $1.84  billion  from  2013  through  2015  and  reduced  medicare spending by $542 million after accounting for shared savings bonuses3.  texas health supports the aco model as a successful approach for encouraging providers to work together to reduce costs and improve the quality of healthcare for medicare beneficiaries.\n supporting  the  movement  to  these  value-based  payment  models  goes  beyond  the  quality  and financial  results  of  acos.  from  a  market  perspective,  we  will  never  achieve  innovation  in healthcare except through the creative power of healthcare providers seeking to innovate the care delivery process.  models in which payers seek to achieve savings and quality improvement will\n\nms. seema verma

results.  we have seen firsthand the remarkable innovations that are spurred by this accountability such as those in telehealth, the hospital in the home, special care centers, organizing community support organizations and systematically addressing the social determinates of health.\n the pathways to success establishes a step-wise approach for acos increasingly taking on more downside  risk.  we  agree that  it  is  imperative  that  over  time  providers  become  increasingly responsible for total cost of care through risk-bearing agreements; however, cms must ensure providers have proper tools and experience to achieve this vision.  we believe that with proper incentives and improvements in the program organizations will take on risk, seeing the quality, clinical  innovation  and  business  benefit  from  doing  so.  specifically,  cms  should  consider  the following within the context of mssp and any new payment models:\n sufficient time in an upside-only model prior to moving to downside risk.  acos are more likely to achieve shared savings with time.  specifically, studies show that the shared savings rate doubles with three years of experience from 21 percent for acos in the first year to over 40 percent for acos in the third of fourth year4.  accordingly, texas health recommends at least three years in an upside only model for new acos entering the mssp.  beyond the mssp program, we believe it is imperative for cms to provide a long-term vision and roadmap for the transition to value-based and risk-based models.  in the absence of a clear timeline, some providers are reluctant to embark on new models.  when providers have a clear plan for moving to new models (e.g. the maryland all-payer model), providers work aggressively to succeed in the model and more rapidly advance to the risk-bearing model.\n high performers should be encouraged to participate in models regardless of provider type. the mssp performance data summarizes average aco performance, masking differences among high and low performers within each category.  we strongly discourage the application of policies targeting provider types that are intended to modify the behavior of the lowest performers; these policies impact high and low performers, thereby disincentivizing high performers from continuing in the model and producing savings.  specifically, we request that cms eliminate the distinction of high and low revenue acos and avoid creating new blunt tools to define acos (e.g. physician-led and hospital-led).  in any payment model cms should create a level competitive playing field and let those that perform best succeed most.  cms should find non-provider defined approaches to eliminate poor performers.\n ensure a business case for taking on risk.  cms must ensure that acos and new payment models, particularly voluntary models, provide incentives for taking on risk.  the existing models to date have ignored the significant investment costs required to start or continue participation in a model.  even when these costs are not incorporated into the payment model, providers will consider potential  return  on  investment  when  determining  whether  to  enter  a  new  model.  cms  must recognize this dynamic and ensure that acos and other models will attract providers. specifically, cms should: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increase the shared savings rate for acos to at least 50 percent. as discussed below reducing the savings rate prevents acos from recouping initial investments, reinvesting savings into population health activities, and recruiting providers with the use of gainsharing agreements. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 support providers in achieving faster learning. as a participating organization of premier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aco collaborative, texas health has greatly outpaced the nation. making up just six percent of all medicare acos, the premier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population health management collaborative acos generated\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 3 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970 20 percent of the program savings since 2012. in fact, if all medicare acos performed at the level of premier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population health management collaborative acos, medicare could have doubled its savings since 2012 to $4 billion. premier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collaborative uses data, best practice sharing and hands-on performance improvement support to achieve this superior performance. we believe that cms should invest in facilitating learning networks where acos learn best practices from the leading acos. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 provide additionally flexibility in the models for acos taking on risk. to be best suited to take on  more  risk,  within  an  aco  or  any  payment  mode,  and  effectively  manage  the  care  of populations providers require flexibility. while beneficial, the current approaches to providing flexibility  (e.g.  snf  and telehealth  waivers,  beneficiary  incentive  program)  represent  limited portions of medicare benefits and thus limited opportunities for transforming care. within the next  generation  aco  model  cms  incorporated  several  options  that  provide  flexibility  and should be considered for inclusion in the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0094choice on enrolling tin or npi, infrastructure payment,  prepayment  of  shared  savings  and  primary  capitation.  similarly,  cms  should consider aspects of medicare advantage that could be incorporated into acos. while ma is a capitated full-risk model, providers would benefit from the flexibilities in performance-based risk models.  specifically,  cms  should  consider  incorporating  utilization  management  into  acos and expanding on the beneficiary incentive payment by incorporating aspects of the ma value- based  insurance  design  (vbid)  model,  allowing  acos  to  offer  supplemental  benefits  or reduced cost sharing to aligned beneficiaries with specified chronic conditions, focused on the services that are of highest clinical value to them.\n redesigning participation options to facilitate performance-based risk phase-in of performance-based risk in the basic track cms proposes to redesign the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance-based risk tracks by retiring track 1 (no risk, upside only) and track 2 and creating a new basic track.  in the basic track, participants could begin  participation  in  a  one-sided  risk  model  and  phase-in  risk over  the  course  of  a  single agreement period; the highest level of risk is comparable to the current track 1+.  additionally, the proposed rule retains track 3, renaming it as the enhanced track.  eligible acos would enter into these two tracks for an agreement period of 5 years (the first agreement period, if stated in july 2019 would be 5 years and 6 months).  within the basic track, cms proposes a glide path that  includes  5  levels:  a  one-sided  risk  model  available  only  for  the  first  two  consecutive performance years (levels a & b), and three levels of progressively higher risk and potential reward in performance years 3 through 5 of the agreement period (levels c, d, and e).  acos would automatically advance at the start of each participation years along this glide path until they reach the track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maximum level of risk/reward (designed to be the same as the track 1+ model).\n texas health supports an agreement period of at least five years, as we believe that this adds  stability  to  the  program.  we  have concerns,  however,  that  the  progression  cms proposes  to  two-sided  risk  in  the  basic  track  is  far  too  aggressive  and  will  deter participation in the mssp.  we believe that the two years in a one-sided risk model is insufficient for acos to prepare for moving to downside risk.  numerous studies show that acos require about 3-4 years to become successful.5  this is not surprising given that acos receive feedback on their performance several months into their first agreement period\u00e2\u0080\u0095any initiatives designed to improve performance always take more time than anticipated, and this is particularly true for the complex organizations  and  agreements  that  comprise  an  aco.  organizations  need  time  to  make  the structural, cultural, and practice changes required to successfully manage and assume financial risk for a population.  in recognition of the time required for acos to be successful, cms should\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 4 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970 allow at least three years of no-downside risk within the basic track to ensure the success of participating acos and encourage future participation.  cms should extend an optional fourth year in a one-sided track for acos that achieve savings, not necessarily shared savings, and have high quality.\n shared savings rate\n texas health urges cms to set the entry-level risk for the basic track at 50 percent with gradual increases in the shared-savings rate as acos progress through the various levels. lowering the shared-savings rate for acos with no downside risk from 50 percent to 25 percent provides little incentive for new acos to join the program.  the low shared-savings rate also does not consider the substantial investment needed on the part of acos.  according to an analysis by the american hospital association (aha), the investment required to put in place and sustain the elements necessary for a successful aco has been $11.6 to $26.1 million higher than previous estimates by cms.  these costs, coupled with the cost of having a repayment mechanism in place to cover losses, creates a high hurdle for organizations who are transitioning to accountable care.\n the proposed shared savings rate is a significant decrease for existing acos, which will be unable to  reinvest  savings  back  into  population  management  and  care  coordination.  shared  savings payments  are  critical  as  part  of  an  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  transformation  toward  value-based  care  and  are necessary to incentivize providers to make the infrastructure investments needed to transform care delivery and processes.  without them, acos will struggle to provide care and services needed to appropriately manage the health of the population and move more rapidly to risk, undermining the overall  goal  of  the  program.  reducing  shared  savings  also  produces  problems  with  provider participation and aco buy-in, as some organizations already find this difficult at current shared savings level.  to incentivize acos to take on risk, cms should increase the shared-savings rates as they take on additional risk.  we recommend increasing the shared savings by five percent with each step: levels  a/b: 50 percent; levels c/d: 55 percent; and level e: 60 percent.\n calculation of loss sharing limit\n texas health supports using the lower of the revenue-based or historical benchmark for calculation of the loss sharing limit.  however, we recommend that cms align the risk level for track e with the nominal risk threshold for  apm models established under the qpp, which  is three percent  of  the  historical  benchmark,  rather  than  the four percent  cms proposes.  cms provides no rationale for setting the benchmark-based loss limit at the nominal risk standard plus one percentage point.  the purpose of track e is to provide aco entities with a more  gradual  pathway  to  risk,  while  also  meeting  the  requirements  of  an  aapm.  setting  the historical-benchmark  at  a  higher  level  would  disproportionately  affect  acos  with  hospital participants  and  subject  them  to  additional  risk  as  they  will  always  use  the  historical-based benchmark since medicare part a and b revenue will far exceed the historic-based benchmark. accordingly, increasing the benchmark-based loss limit creates an unlevel playing field for acos that include hospital participants.  this proposed policy is counter to the goal of acos to encourage providers to work together to improve care for beneficiaries and discourages both health-system led and physician-led acos from recruiting hospital participants.\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 5 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970\n transition from level e to enhanced track texas health urges cms to create additional levels within the enhanced track to build a more gradual transition from level e to enhanced.  as proposed, many acos would not be eligible for the basic track or able to renew within the basic track for a second agreement period and would only have the option to enroll in the enhanced track.  cms should either build a glide path to the highest risk level within the enhanced track or offer an additional track to help bridge the  gap  between  the  basic  and  enhanced  tracks.  to  further  maximize  interest  in  acos transitioning to the enhacned track, cms should start the shared savings rate to 80 percent (same  as  the  next  generation  aco  program)  and  increase  the  maximum  shared  savings  and losses rate over the agreement period.\n permitting annual participation elections annual risk election cms proposes to allow acos in the basic track to more rapidly transition (i.e., skip a level or levels) during the agreement period, but level e must be entered into no later than the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth performance year under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal.  texas health encourages cms to provide acos with more flexibility in their annual participation elections.  if an aco selects a higher level of risk  than  it  would  have  been  automatically  assigned,  it  should  not  be  required  to automatically advance the following year (i.e., an aco is not required to advance beyond the track they would have been assigned if they did not choose to advance to a higher track). as noted earlier, acos require additional time moving to risk.  this option would provide acos the option to gain experience in a limited risk track for more than one year.  additionally, we ask that cms consider allowing high performing acos more than one year in limited risk tracks (i.e. level c and d); cms could set parameters for successful acos to continue in a particular track prior to automatic advancing (i.e. achieving savings, not necessarily shared savings, and high quality).\n annual election of beneficiary assignment\n in alignment with the bipartisan budget act of 2018, cms proposes to allow all acos with a choice of prospective assignment for the agreement periods beginning july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years.  as proposed, acos would also be able to change its beneficiary assignment methodology through the annual election process.  texas health strongly supports this change that would allow  acos  the  option  of  choosing  prospective  beneficiary  assignment  or  prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation.  this would provide acos with flexibility to better manage their patient populations based on their unique circumstances.  certain acos, such as a small aco that is worried about dropping below the 5,000-beneficiary threshold, may favor a model where the aco can add beneficiaries throughout the year, and would thus prefer the retrospective assignment model.  other acos would likely prefer a prospective model, which would help them stabilize their beneficiary population.  the prospective approach also allows more advanced acos to employ data analysis and beneficiary engagement techniques from the start of the performance period on a population for whom they they are responsible.\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 6 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970 higher risk than low revenue acos. cms provides fewer participation options for high revenue acos.  high  revenue  acos  with  \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d  can  only  participate  in  the  enhanced  track regardless of whether they are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cre-entering\u00e2\u0080\u009d the program.  in addition, low revenue (and inexperienced) acos may operate under the basic track for a maximum of two agreement periods, whereas high revenue acos are limited to one agreement period.\n texas  health opposes  this  proposal  and  urges  cms  to  eliminate  the  low/high  revenue distinction for determining participation options.  we firmly believe that all acos should the  treated  the  same.  this  proposed  distinction  is  unnecessary  and  harmful,  as  it  would discourage  acos  that  have  the  potential  to  generate  substantial  savings  to  the  program  from participating.  the  premise  cms  uses  for  hospital-led  versus  physician-led  distinction  is  also flawed.  cms argues that this policy decision is due in part to low revenue acos producing 2 percent of savings compared to 0.2 percent for high-revenue acos.  a premier, inc. analysis of hospital-led vs. physician-led acos revealed two-major findings that refute this assumption: an analysis of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 definition of hospital-led (the aco includes a hospital tin participant) found that it is inaccurate with at least 20 percent of health system-led acos being designated as \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician\nled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  some  of  the  highest  performing  individual  acos  are  hospital-led  acos.    should  they, \n therefore, be advantaged over physician-led acos?\n cms argues that many low-revenue acos are not well-capitalized and therefore unable to absorb losses as well as high-revenue acos.  regardless of structure, significant investments are needed in population health platforms and care process changes for acos to bear risk. medicare revenue is also not indicative of ability to bear risk.  cms is unable to identify if an aco is well capitalized through sources outside of medicare revenue (i.e., insurer or investor backed acos).  accordingly, cms  is  unable  to  truly  identify  whether  an  aco  is  well  capitalized  and  thus  should  not  create distinctions based on assumptions about capital. setting up a system that disadvantages hospital- led acos limits the types of innovations needed to build a high performing healthcare system for the range of communities across the nation.\n cms makes a flawed assumption that acos, in some cases, encourage harmful consolidation in the marketplace.  the biggest driver of consolidation is the incessant payment cuts on providers by public payers.  health care systems and hospitals need to consolidate to manage against these cuts and improve efficiency.  moreover, consolidation is occurring across the healthcare industry for  many reasons  and  is  not  necessarily  negative.  providers  and  other  healthcare  entities  are seeking  to  develop  high-value  care  networks  that  break  down  the  artificial  silos  that  cause duplicative, fragmented patient care.  acos do not drive physician employment, but rather, acos support  greater  clinical  integration  and  collaboration  among  doctors,  hospitals  and  other  care providers and align the payment system to incent coordination and cost savings across these silos. this alignment accomplishes what the model is designed to do, and what providers need out of high-value networks, without necessitating employment of physicians.  some of the most effective acos  in  premier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  population  health  collaborative  engage most independent  clinicians.  the greatest fear related to consolidation is its potential to lead to higher prices.  ultimately, the only way to protect against escalating costs is to advance these alternative payment models that hold providers accountable and give them the opportunity to improve care and reduce costs for an entire population.\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 7 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970 while increasing the focus on primary care.  one might argue that an aco should require a hospital participant and other providers across the care continuum to ensure that acos do not simply keep patients  away  from  a  particular  setting  but  ensure  patients  receive  care  in  the  least  restrictive setting.  while it would be absurd to define what providers an aco must include it is equally absurd to say that acos that work to include multiple provider types should be forced to risk sooner.\n we believe that healthy market competition relies on a level playing field.  this administration has been outspoken in advocating for market solutions and level playing fields among competitors. this proposed policy, however, is contrary to a market-based approach whereby all competitors have similar opportunities for success.  whenever there is an uneven playing field, one competitor will use it to their advantage over another.  alternatively, competitors can take steps to game the system.  advantaging one group over another can also create perverse incentives to undermine a competitor overall.\n defining participation options by \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms  also  proposes  to  limit  participations  options  by  categorizing  acos  as  \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d  or \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d  with  performance-based  risk  medicare  aco  initiatives  and  determining participation options based on prior participation of aco legal entity and aco participants.  cms defines a \u00e2\u0080\u009cre-entering aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d as (1) the same legal entity as an aco, identified by tin, or a (2) new legal entity that has never participated in the mssp and is applying to participate in the program and more than 50 percent of its aco participants were included on the aco participant list.  cms defines an experienced aco that meets either of the following criteria: (1) the aco is the same legal  entity  as  a  current  or  previous  aco  that  is  participating  in,  or  has  participated  in,  a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under track 2 or track 3; or (2) 40 percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or in an aco that deferred its entry  into  a  mssp  agreement  period  under  track  2  or  track  3,  in  any  of  the  5  most  recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n texas health supports the participation options based on prior participation and definitions of renewing/re-entering acos and the 50 percent threshold.  we generally support the cms definition of experienced, but urge cms to increase the threshold from 40 percent to 50 percent to align with the new/re-entering definition.  we also encourage cms to monitor the impact of this policy and consider creating an appeals process.  for example, it is possible that two separate acos discontinue operation in a region then a new entity, completely unaffiliated with either prior entity, forms in the region and recruit participants involved in the prior organization.  the intent of the policy is to avoid gaming of the options for the glidepath not to discourage new entities. to balance this potential outcome, cms should also consider a second criterion, setting a threshold for a percentage of participants that previously were in the same entity.  for example, cms would first identify if 50 percent of participants would qualify aco to be reentering or experienced; then if less than 30 percent of participants were part of the same legal entity then the aco could appeal the label of reentering or experienced.\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 8 of 15\n 612 e. lamar

program and generate net losses to medicare.\n texas health opposes the cms proposal to terminate acos if negative outside corridor for two  agreement  periods.  we  believe  that  these  additional  provisions,  if  implemented,  would provide  cms  with  too much  discretion to  terminate  aco  participation  in  the  program.  we are concerned  that  such  unchecked  authority  provided  to  cms  would  further  discourage  acos participating in the mssp, as this would create additional uncertainty for participants and would also make it difficult to establish agreements with other organizations.  moreover, cms proposals with respect to the glide path that would limit participation in one-sided risk models would also provide acos with incentives to leave the program if they were not able to generate savings.\n election of minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss rate (mlr) by acos cms proposes that acos under the basic track would have the same msr/mlr options that are currently available to acos under one-sided and two-side models of the mssp.  acos under the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path in level a or level b would choose the msr/mlr to be applied before the start of their first performance year in a two-sided model. cms also proposes to use a variable msr/mlr when performing shared savings and shared losses if an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population falls below 5,000 for the performance year, regardless of whether the aco selected a fixed  or  variable  msr/mlr.  texas  health supports  these  proposals  and  appreciates  the flexibility these options provide to meet acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs.\n participation options for agreement periods beginning in 2019 cms proposes to offer a july 1, 2019 start date as the initial opportunity for acos to enter an agreement period under the basic or enhanced track.  as proposed, acos that entered a first or  second  agreement  period  with  a  start  date  of  january  1,  2016,  may  elect  to  extend  their agreement period for an optional fourth performance year, defined as the six-month period from january 1, 2019 through june 30, 2019.  cms notes that this election to extend the agreement period is voluntary and an aco could therefore conclude its participation in the program with the expiration of its current agreement period on december 31, 2018.\n texas health is concerned that this policy will result in an aco managing the costs and quality of two  separate  beneficiary  populations.  each  six-month  performance  period  has  two

aligned beneficiaries could be significantly different.  while some beneficiaries will be attributed to the aco for both performance periods, there will be a portion of an acos beneficiary that are attributed for only one performance period.  for beneficiaries attributed for only the first performance period, the aco will have to continue to deploy resources to manage this population after they are no longer aligned with the aco and the aco is unable to take advantage of the waivers available in the program. for beneficiaries attributed only in the second performance period, the aco will be responsible for costs incurred in the first half of the year when the aco had no ability to manage the beneficiaries care.\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 9 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd.,

provide a july 1, 2019 start date option for new and existing acos.  at a minimum, cms should use a singular assignment window and methodology  to  determine  the  assigned  population  for  the  entire  calendar  year  2019, regardless of whether they are in an extended agreement or the new model.\n finally, texas  health  is concerned  that  implementation  issues  could  arise  if  cms  rushes  the application process, so we urge cms to ensure that there is enough time for cms and participants to prepare for an application cycle after the final rule.  we respectfully request that cms delay the july  1,  2019  start  and  offer  a  one-year  extension  to  all  current  acos  who  are  ending  their agreements if cms is not ready to implement a new model.\n benchmarking methodology refinements risk adjustment methodology texas health appreciates the risk adjustment refinements cms proposes that would eliminate the distinction of newly and continuously aligned beneficiaries for purposes of risk adjustment.  this appropriately  recognizes that risk scores should increase  or  decrease  during the  course  of the agreement period and that the beneficiary population underlying health changes with time.  we urge cms, however, to raise the cap as +/- 3 percent is too restrictive; +/- 5 percent would more accurately account for changes in risk over a performance period.  ideally, cms should provide additional incentives for acos to move to higher risk levels by providing additional flexibility in accounting for the risk of the population.  this could be accomplished by allowing the cap to increase as acos take on additional risk.  level e in the basic track, for example, would have a higher cap than levels c and d.  we also believe that the cap for the enhanced track should align with the percentage change in risk scores for ma plans.\n use of regional factors when establishing and resetting aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmarks cms proposes to incorporate regional expenditures into the benchmarking methodology for acos in a first agreement period for all acos entering the program beginning on july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years.  under current policy, the maximum weight applied to the regional adjustment is 70 percent.  cms proposes policies that would limit the magnitude of the adjustment by reducing the weight (to a maximum of 50 percent) and imposing an absolute dollar limit on the adjustment (capped at 5 percent of the national per capita expenditures for parts a and b services in baseline year 3 for assignable beneficiaries).\n texas health supports the cms proposal to incorporate the regional adjustment into the initial agreement period.  we do not support lowering the regional contribution to below 50 percent and urge cms to maintain the current maximum contribution of 70 percent.  as such we recommend the following schedule of weights to be applied:\n schedule of weights for regional adjustment timing when subject to regional adjustment aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical spending is lower than its region aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical spending is higher than its region first time 30% 25% second time 50% 35%

on more risk.  cms should provide an option for acos to use national benchmarks (in lieu of regional) for risk-bearing acos.  this would be more desirable for acos in historically low spend regions that believe their targets are too low to take on downside risk.\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements skilled nursing facility (snf) three-day rule waiver expansion currently, the snf three-day rule waiver can be requested only by those mssp acos that bear performance-based risk and to whom beneficiaries are prospectively assigned.  cms proposes to expand the waiver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s applicability beginning july 1, 2019, to include performance-risk bearing acos that  utilize  preliminary  prospective  beneficiary  assignment.    in  all  cases,  the  snf  must  be  an eligible affiliate of the aco and, in most cases, have a rating of three stars or better in the cms five-star snf quality rating system (cms also is proposing to allow swing bed operators, who are  not  included  in  the  star  rating  system,  to  become  eligible  snf  affiliates).   the  waiver  is available currently to track 3 and track 1+ acos; the proposed expansion would include track 2, basic track levels c, d, and e and the enhanced track.  texas health supports the proposed expansion of snf three-day rule waiver applicability as another important tool with which acos  can  more  effectively  coordinate  care  while  increasing  quality  and  reducing unnecessary costs.\n telehealth waiver expansion in keeping with the provisions of the bipartisan budget act of 2018, cms proposes that existing originating site and geographic restrictions would be waived when medicare-approved telehealth services are furnished to ffs beneficiaries by mssp aco professionals.  the waiver would take effect beginning with performance year 2020 and be limited to those acos that bear performance- based risk and to whom beneficiaries are prospectively assigned.  the services must be billed through the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tin and may not be designated as inpatient-only.  the expanded telehealth policy would apply to track 3 and to track 1+ acos as well as to those on the newly proposed enhanced track and on levels c, d, and e of the basic track.  we support the telehealth expansion as proposed, particularly when combined with the increased flexibility that would occur with the proposed ability for acos to annually elect either prospective or preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment.\n other needed waivers additional waivers are critical to removing persistent legal and regulatory barriers that inhibit mssp aco providers from working together to provide better-coordinated, high-quality care, most notably pertaining to the applicable fraud and abuse laws (e.g., the stark and anti-kickback statutes and the beneficiary inducements civil monetary penalty (cmp) provisions).  texas health continues to recommend that cms should allow: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 acos to more appropriately and conscientiously manage post-acute care utilization and more strongly influence \u00e2\u0080\u009cout-of-aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d provider selection by beneficiaries;

tracks; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 aco participation waiver that applies broadly to aco-related arrangements during the term of the participation agreement; and, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 shared savings distributions waiver that applies to distributions and uses of any earned shared savings payments or internal costs savings.\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 11 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970 beneficiaries assigned to mssp acos, regardless of assignment methodology, retain their rights to seek care outside of the aco without penalty.  therefore, to effectively deliver value-based care, acos must seek to actively engage the beneficiaries for whom they will be held accountable for quality and cost, yet mssp acos are prohibited from marketing activities, such as those permitted for medicare advantage (ma) plans.  current regulations do allow acos to provide in-kind items or services as incentives, the propriety of which are judged on a case-by-case basis, but acos are inhibited by the simultaneously applicable statutes (e.g., anti-kickback and cmp provisions).  the bipartisan  budget  act  of  2018 enables  performance-based  risk-bearing  acos  to  establish incentive  payment  programs  to  encourage  their  assigned  beneficiaries  to  obtain  medically necessary  primary  care  services,  beginning  no  later  than  january  1,  2020.    cms  proposes implementing  regulations,  including  aco  eligibility  and  incentive  program  application  and certification processes, with a start date of july 1, 2019 (coinciding with the first agreement period of the redesigned aco tracks).  cms also addresses beneficiary eligibility, primary care services that  would  qualify  for  incentive  payments,  and  incentive  program  recordkeeping,  along  with payment amount, timing, and distribution method.\n texas  health appreciates  that  the  regulations  proposed  by  cms  to  implement  the  beneficiary incentive payment program as directed by bipartisan budget act of 2018, are not overly restrictive and are attentive to minimizing provider and beneficiary burden.   given longstanding concerns about compliance of aco incentive programs with applicable fraud and abuse laws, texas health requests that cms provide template language for use by acos to notify beneficiaries about their new incentive programs.  finally, since establishing a primary care incentive payment program is optional for acos, we recommend that cms make available summary information  about  the  uptake  of  beneficiary  incentive  programs  when  reporting  overall mssp results.  information from early adopters of incentive programs would be valuable to the remaining acos when making their decisions about applying to establish incentive programs.\n beneficiary notifications cms requires that mssp acos notify beneficiaries that their care is being furnished under a shared savings payment model and that they may opt out of having identifiable, claims-level data about themselves  shared  with  their  acos.  cms  has  modified  the  content,  frequency  and  delivery mechanisms  for  beneficiary  notification  multiple  times  since  the  mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  inception.  currently, notices must be posted in acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 primary care delivery sites and a written beneficiary information notice must be provided upon beneficiary request.  cms proposes to expand the requirements beginning july 1, 2019, creating a cms template notice, designed to be a comprehensive single source of mssp information that must be given to beneficiaries during their first primary care visit of each performance year.   cms further proposes to add material to the revised notice informing beneficiaries of their option to voluntarily designate an aco professional to coordinate their care\n(i.e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary clinician\u00e2\u0080\u009d or\u00e2\u0080\u009d main doctor\u00e2\u0080\u009d), thereby implementing the voluntary alignment provisions \n of bipartisan budget act of 2018.\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 12 of

is unlikely either to be retained or to be readily retrieved later when needed. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 prior  similar  requirements  for  expanded  notifications  during  primary  care  visits  led  to considerable confusion among beneficiaries; for example, some beneficiaries believed that the data-sharing notification was in reality an attempt by the aco to steal their identities. many acos had to reassign staff members from clinical duties to answering beneficiary questions about various notification provisions. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 clinical  workflows  and  electronic  record  systems  would  require  reconfiguration  (e.g., scheduling  additional  visit  time,  incorporating  reminder  prompts  and  documentation  of notification delivery) to assure that the required notifications occurred at the time of the initial primary care visit of each performance year. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 beneficiaries should be able to specify how information is most effectively exchanged with them by cms and by their acos (e.g., hard copy, 1-800-medicare, electronic mail).\n texas health recommends that no changes be made to the current notification processes regarding  the  shared  savings  payment  model,  aco  participation  by  a  beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practitioners, and opting out of beneficiary identifiable, claims-level data-sharing.   we also recommend that notification about voluntary alignment be presented separately, in keeping with the bipartisan budget act of 2018 provisions designed to support access to this choice by beneficiaries and the potential of this option to directly increase beneficiary engagement. we also recommend that mssp aco beneficiary user groups be created and that no new or revised notifications be implemented without input from those groups; their input should also guide delivery method choices made available to beneficiaries for various notifications.\n opt-in assignment methodology cms  discusses  at  length  and  invites  comments  about  all  aspects  of  a  hybrid  assignment methodology that would include direct aco opt in (a beneficiary chooses assignment to a specific aco);  voluntary  alignment  with  an  aco  professional  (with  resulting  assignment to the  aco  in which that professional participates); and, a modification of the current claims-based assignment methodology (incorporating a minimum level of primary care visits furnished to a beneficiary).  cms does not make any formal proposal about the hybrid methodology nor indicate a timeline for further consideration of its implementation.\n we appreciate  that  cms  is  exploring  the  potential  for  opt-in  assignment  to  increase  aco beneficiary engagement that then could lead to more effective care coordination with improved quality and decreased costs.   texas health does not support implementation of the hybrid opt-in methodology as discussed in the rule at this time.  instead, we recommend that cms do the following: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 maintain the existing claims-based methodology combined with the voluntary alignment option (and minimizing the notification burden related to that option); \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 expeditiously test an option for beneficiary opt-in directly to an aco (in parallel to the existing beneficiary  voluntary  alignment  directly  to  an  aco  professional). testing should  explore appropriate marketing opportunities for acos analogous to those for ma plans; and, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 explore additional approaches hybrid assignment and choose one or more for limited-scale testing before proposing any program-wide replacement mssp assignment methodology, cms should  explore  rules  for  rejecting  opt-in  or  voluntary  assignment  (e.g.  when  a  beneficiary resides outside the geographic region, when a beneficiary does not receive at least one service from a participating provider in the aco).\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 13 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970 voluntary alignment policy revisions medicare  ffs  beneficiaries  may  choose  to  designate  an  aco  professional  as  their  primary clinician for coordinating their care, and the beneficiary who does so becomes voluntarily aligned to the designated professional\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aco.  currently, a primary clinician must be either a primary care practitioner or practice one of a limited list of specialties (e.g., cardiology), and the beneficiary must have received at least one primary care service from a professional who practices primary care or a listed specialty in the aligned aco.  as part of bipartisan budget act of 2018 implementation, cms  proposes  policy  revisions  to  begin  with  performance  year  2019  including  removing  the specialty restrictions to primary clinician eligibility and no longer requiring the voluntarily aligned beneficiary  to  have  received  any  services  from  a  professional  in  the  aligned  aco  during  the applicable beneficiary assignment window.  we support the removal of specialty restrictions for  primary  clinicians  but  recommends  retention  of  the  requirement  for  a  beneficiary  to receive at least one primary care service from an aco participant\n revised definitions of primary care for use in beneficiary assignment in accordance with provisions of the 21st century cures act and bipartisan budget act of 2018, for performance years 2019 and thereafter cms proposes to update the definition of primary care services that is used when assigning beneficiaries to acos (in combination with the applicable mssp track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assignment methodology).  services that would satisfy the revised definition include some  existing  current  procedural terminology  (cpt) codes  (e.g.,  advance  care  planning)  and healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) g-codes (e.g., depression screening) along with new g-codes proposed elsewhere in the rule (e.g., complexity inherent in office visits for  certain  specialties).  cms  also  proposes  to  more  accurately  distinguish  short-term, rehabilitation-related  evaluation  and  management  services  provided  in  nursing  facilities  from ongoing  primary  care  services  furnished  to  longer-term  nursing  facility  residents.    cms  would identify the former services by linking the appropriate cpt codes to nursing facility claims for the same dates of service rather than relying on the place of service code for snfs (code 31) as listed on the professional claim.   texas health supports the proposed changes and agrees with cms that linking snf facility claims by date of service to professional claims will better identify short-term, rehabilitation-focused care that should not be counted as primary care services that contribute to beneficiary assignment to acos.\n extreme and uncontrollable circumstances in december 2017, cms issued an interim final rule with comment period that established policies to address quality performance scoring and shared loss determinations for mssp acos impacted by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances occurring in performance year 2017 (e.g., hurricanes and widespread wildfires).  cms proposes some limited changes to update the existing policies for use in performance year 2018 and subsequent years, including revisions to align the performance scoring  and  shared  loss  determination  processes  with  the  proposed  redesigned  aco  tracks. texas  health supports  continuation  of  the  extreme  and  uncontrollable  circumstances policies as applied in 2017 with the proposed revisions.\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 14 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970 coordination and population health and that cms commit funding to development of such measures.\n cms states that he medicare program has become the largest payer for prescription opioids in the united states.  as a result, medicare drug event records now constitute a substantial and critically important repository of substance use disorder data.  cms currently provides part d prescription drug event data to each aco on a monthly basis, but items potentially related to substance use disorders  are  routinely  de-identified,  provided  only  in  aggregate,  or  both.    acos  are  held accountable for the total health of their beneficiary populations, but the ability of acos to most effectively  manage  population  health  is  being  increasingly  constrained  by  the  limited  and  non- specific  substance  disorder  data  with  which  they  are  provided.    many  beneficiaries  are  taking multiple medications and are at high risk for adverse drug interactions when opioids are prescribed for them.  we believe that it is unfair to hold acos accountable for measures of substance use disorder management until cms provides acos with access to the data necessary for instituting  appropriate  treatment  (i.e.,  complete  and  identifiable  data  for  all  prescribed medications and their related diagnoses).\n in support of optimizing population health management by mssp acos, including substance use disorders, texas health continues to advocate for statutory reform of 42 cfr part 2 (confidentiality of substance use disorder patient records) to make substance use data more readily available to providers who are already subject to hipaa patient privacy protection regulations.  until part 2 reform  is  enacted, we  again  strongly  recommend that  providers  who  are  engaged  in population health management (e.g. acos) and that are bound by a data use agreement with cms, receive complete and identifiable data from cms about substance use disorder- -related diagnoses and services furnished to their assigned beneficiaries by providers to whom part 2 does not apply.\n cms further states that over one-third of beneficiaries assigned to mssp acos with continuous part d coverage have at least one opioid prescription but that rates vary substantially across acos (10-60%).   we believe that such variability strongly suggests opportunities to improve the quality of  care  for  substance  use  disorders  in  many  acos.   assuming  that  cms  makes  sufficient beneficiary medication data available, we generally support consideration by cms of adding opioid use measures to the mssp measure set.  in particular, however, we oppose addition of measures that focus primarily on opioid dosing (e.g., nqf #2951 use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer).  we are concerned that rigid adherence to dosing guidelines (e.g., the centers for disease control & prevention guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain) may cause serious adverse outcomes (e.g., depression, suicide) for  patients  being  successfully  managed  on  long-term  opioid  analgesics  whose  dosing regimens are abruptly changed to achieve guideline compliance.\n\nms. seema verma  \n october 16, 2018 page 15 of 15\n 612 e. lamar blvd., suite 900, arlington, texas 76011-4130 | 682.236.6970 create disparate

could simply certify their cehrt usage.  the pi category weight for such  clinicians  would  then  be  redistributed  equally  to  the  quality  and  clinical  practice improvement activities performance categories.\n pharmacy care coordination: request for comments texas health supports cms exploring approaches that could facilitate collaboration between acos and part d stand-alone prescription drug plan sponsors and lead to improved outcomes, such as more  widespread  use  of  medication therapy  management.  cms  should  investigate ways  to make complete pharmacy data more readily available to mssp acos and their clinicians. particular  attention  should  be  given  to  enabling  technology  methods  (e.g.,  secure  data  access portals, data sets accessible using application programming interfaces) that could provide acos with  real-time  access  to  claims  data  (prior  to  or  synchronous  with  claims  processing)  for their aligned beneficiaries.  real-time access would allow acos to build provider alert processes that would improve care by triggering rapid clinical interventions when needed, as is being done already by some ma and commercial plans.\n cms should develop one or more voluntary mssp demonstrations that incorporate aco accountability for part d costs.  doing so would allow those acos who are ready and interested to participate, would accelerate progress towards readiness by the remaining acos, and would provide a platform for testing multiple approaches, the most effective of which could be expanded to all acos.  maximizing flexibility should be a guiding principle in designing such demonstrations; for example, allowing acos to select patient cohorts for whom to be responsible (e.g., high-risk patients with diabetes or patients with multiple chronic conditions)\n overall, texas health is committed success of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 alternative payment models and encourage cms to consider models beyond acos.  specifically, we recommend cms consider adopting a \u00e2\u0080\u009clayered payment model\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a provider-driven aco model that includes primary care capitation as well as inpatient and outpatient bundles within a global capitated amount along with legal waivers that will allow providers to employ tools similar to ma plans.  additionally, we urge cms to test a provider-driven  global  capitation  models;  for  example,  a  model  aligned  with  h.r.  5841  as introduced by congressmen mike kelly and richard neale during the 114th congress.\n in closing,

under the current medicare shared savings program (mssp) beneficiary assignment regulations, an np is an authorized aco professional, but their patients cannot be assigned to the aco unless they receive one primary care service from a primary care physician participating with the aco each year. this has inhibited np practices from joining or establishing shared savings aco's and limited the scope of the shared savings program (mssp). if the mssp is to continue to develop and improve patient access, quality and cost effectiveness, it must be fully inclusive of nps and their

choose an np as their primary shared savings aco clinician and be assigned to an mssp aco without requiring a primary care service from a primary care physician. this proposal will increase the

represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing

organizations--pathways to success\u00e2\u0080\u009d (cms-1701-p). as the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest organization of board-certified pathologists and leading provider of laboratory accreditation and proficiency testing programs, the cap serves patients, pathologists, and the public by fostering and advocating excellence in the practice of pathology and laboratory medicine worldwide.\n the changes proposed to the medicare shared savings program will impact \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe vast majority of medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accountable care organizations (acos).\u00e2\u0080\u009d1 with the goal of improving quality of care and restraining spending, acos incentivize on the basis of outcomes rather than the number of services. as diagnosticians, pathologists apply their expertise to the diagnosis and management of a wide variety of medical conditions, and thus are integral in any care coordination initiatives. in fact, by virtue of their capabilities and roles, many pathologists already coordinate care and undertake efforts targeted at increasing integration to improve patient care and the patient care experience overall. recognition of this fact continues to rise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 according to cap\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2017 practice characteristics survey, more than one-quarter of pathologists said they were either participating in or were actively negotiating participation in an aco compared to 2014 when approximately 20 percent of the practices were participating or negotiating with an aco.2\n still, pathologists face significant challenges participating in many alternative payment models, including acos. for example, despite their unique ability to assist clinicians in meeting their objectives through application of evidence-based approaches to eliminate waste and inefficiencies in laboratory medicine, pathologists have limited control over infrastructure decisions, workflows, and governance structure. given the appropriate resources and role, pathologists can share clinical and financial data as well as vital education \u00e2\u0080\u009cabout the efficacy of new tests and appropriate utilization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d3\n\n\n 2\n college of american pathologists 1001 g street, nw, suite 425w washington, dc 20001 800-392-9994 | cap.org\n while certainly there are instances where pathologists are successfully incorporated into value- based care efforts, it is illustrative of the unique role of pathology in acos that the cap\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most recent practice leader survey found that approximately 28 percent of practice leaders were unsure about whether their practice participates in an aco, and 22 percent of those practice leaders who do participate in acos were unsure of whether pathologists receive any financial incentives or shared savings for aco participation.4\n further, we understand that with this proposed rule, the agency seeks to encourage the transition to two-sided models where providers assume greater levels of risk. while the cap supports the voluntary development of innovative health care payment and delivery models, we believe there are a number of considerations that must be taken seriously to ensure pathologists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 meaningful participation in these models and their ability to effectively contribute to these models\u00e2\u0080\u0099 success. as was stated in the announcement of this proposed rule, acos afford an \u00e2\u0080\u009copportunity to deliver better care in a coordinated fashion, while focusing on patient outcomes instead of processes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d 5 to ensure this opportunity is open to pathologists, the cap urges cms to address the following issues related to performance-based risk, quality measures, and promoting interoperability.\n redesigning participation options to facilitate transition to performance-based risk\n according to the proposed rule, the changes sought by cms would \u00e2\u0080\u009cprovide a new direction for the shared savings program by \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 redesigning the participation options available under the program to encourage acos to transition to two-sided models (in which they may share in savings and are accountable for repaying shared losses).\u00e2\u0080\u009d6 specifically, cms is proposing two tracks for eligible acos: (1) the basic track would allow eligible acos to begin under a one-sided model and incrementally phase-in higher levels of risk, and (2) the enhanced track, which is based on the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing track 3. importantly, under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals, the amount of time an aco can remain in the program without taking on risk would generally be reduced from 6 years to 2 years. as cms explains, under the one-sided model years, \u00e2\u0080\u009can aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maximum shared savings rate would be 25 percent based on quality performance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is down from the maximum sharing rate of 50 percent currently available under track 1.7\n as we have stated in earlier comments to cms, the cap believes it is important to focus on increasing opportunity and incentives for specialty physician involvement in alternative payment models before unnecessarily pursuing increased risk. though there are certainly some new improvements offered by cms in this proposed rule, the reduction of the risk-free years and lowered maximum shared savings rate changes do not appear in line with that objective. in fact, cms estimates that the new policy would lead to a drop of over 100 acos in the next ten years because of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe expectation that the program will be less likely to attract new aco formation in future years as the number of risk-free years available to new acos would be reduced from 6 years \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to 2 years in the basic track, which also has reduced attractiveness with a lower 25 percent maximum sharing rate during the 2 risk-free years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d8\n cms believes the changes are necessary because \u00e2\u0080\u009cacos that take on greater levels of risk show better results for cost and quality over time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the cap is concerned with any changes that could\n\n\n 3\n college of american pathologists 1001 g street, nw, suite 425w washington, dc 20001 800-392-9994 | cap.org\n decrease opportunities for specialists to participate in innovative payment models. research conducted by the cap shows that while the shared savings program and aco arrangements among private payers have existed for several years, many pathologists have not yet undertaken this option though they may still consider it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a recent study found that 30 percent of pathology practices do not contract with an aco but may consider it in the future or are currently exploring the feasibility of forming/joining an aco.9 changes to the shared savings program that would discourage aco formation could create unnecessary hurdles for pathologists to pursue this path, which would detract from the value-based care that is a priority for cms.\n quality measures\n cms remains focused on efforts to update quality measures, reduce regulatory burden, and promote innovation. towards this end, as is explained in this proposed rule, cms is \u00e2\u0080\u009cworking towards assessing performance on only those core issues that are most vital to providing high-quality care and improving patient outcomes, with an emphasis on outcome-based measures, reducing unnecessary burden on providers, and putting patients first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n to aid in this effort, the cap has engaged with cms on how to appropriately measure providers who typically do not furnish services that involve face-to-face interaction with patients, including pathologists. pathologists are key to ensuring the quality of laboratory tests by collecting, surveying, analyzing, and using patient population clinical results to guide therapy, best practices, and safety for individual patients and patient populations. through the years, the cap has advocated to increase flexibility for pathologists in a way that recognizes and accounts for the value pathologists play in patient care as non-patient-facing clinicians. the cap continues to believe considerable accommodations or alternate measures are necessary for non-patient-facing clinicians. further, as cms notes, aligning the quality reporting requirements under the shared savings program with the reporting requirements under other medicare initiatives and those used by other payers will help \u00e2\u0080\u009cminimize the need for shared savings program participants to devote excessive resources to understanding differences in measure specifications or engaging in duplicative reporting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d10 valid and less burdensome measurement of the quality of care provided through acos is essential to ensure the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success and that the promotion of higher quality of care and cost savings are not the result of limiting necessary care. with extensive experience as a quality standards-setting organization, the cap looks forward to continuing our conversation with cms to establish appropriate measures for pathologists as non-patient-facing clinicians.\n cms is also seeking ways quality measures and data sharing may help combat opioid addiction. as stewards of clinical laboratories, pathologists play a critical role in combating the ongoing opioid crisis. pathologists provide oversight and direction in the appropriate use of laboratory tests to detect and monitor the use of opioids and their ever-proliferating synthetic knock-offs. additionally, pathologists advise on clinical test selection to battle the many downstream effects of opioid use, including hiv and hepatitis c infection, as well as detecting and treating organ damage (e.g. liver, heart, kidney, lung) and other effects such as bleeding (coagulation/transfusions). finally, pathologists serve in a unique role as medical examiners documenting the increasing spread of these sequelae through society.\n\n\n\n 4\n college of american pathologists 1001 g street, nw, suite 425w washington, dc 20001 800-392-9994 | cap.org\n given this role in combating the opioid crisis, the cap has previously supported policies that would enhance surveillance activities of controlled substance overdoses. additionally, the cap has urged steps to encourage improved interoperability of various office data systems and support the sharing data related to controlled substance overdoses. uniformity in data sharing is critical for tracking trends and responding to public health and safety crisis like the opioids epidemic. the cap is eager to partner with cms in any opioid utilization efforts.\n promoting interoperability\n as cms explains in the proposed rule, acos participating in the shared savings program are required to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoordinate care across and among primary care physicians, specialists, and acute and post-acute providers and suppliers and to have a written plan to encourage and promote the use of enabling technologies for improving care coordination, including the use of electronic health records and electronic exchange of health information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d11 the cap agrees that the exchange of electronic patient data is the foundation of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to effectively coordinate care. in fact, pathology was one of the earliest specialties to embrace health information technology, utilizing computerized laboratory information systems (lis) to support their work of analyzing patient specimens and generating test results. as owners of the laboratory data, pathologists either have taken, or are looking to take on, a leadership role in making data more accessible and more actionable by physicians to improve care management. it is with an lis that electronic health records (ehr) systems or enterprise-wide clinical information systems exchange laboratory and pathology data. however, most lis cannot attain certified ehr technology (cehrt) status, and, as non-patient facing clinicians, pathologists face unique challenges in meeting many of the typical ehr and health information technology requirements in both the quality payment program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promoting interoperability performance category and the apm cehrt use thresholds.\n cms proposes to add a requirement that all acos demonstrate a specified level of cehrt use in order to be eligible to participate in the shared savings program. specifically, acos that are participating in a non-advanced apm track or payment model would be required to attest that at least 50 percent of their eligible clinicians use cehrt. acos that are participating in a track or payment model within a track that is an advanced apm would be required to attest to the higher of 50 percent or the cehrt threshold required for advanced apms.\n generally, the cap appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal to encourage continued ehr and cehrt adoption. however, because of the many unique challenges in this area for pathologists, the cap urges cms to consider the contributions of diagnostic specialties in the exchange of electronic patient data. for example, while cms proposes to discontinue the quality measure that incorporates the promoting interoperability performance category, we would again highlight that many of the measures under the promoting interoperability performance category require face-to-face interaction with patients and therefore are not applicable to pathologists. the cap is continuing to explore alternatives for pathologists that recognize their efforts in promoting the electronic exchange of health information, while ensuring their participation in the promoting interoperability category is not administratively burdensome. further, the cap is actively working to find a solution to the current limited cehrt definition that excludes liss, which could allow participation in the promoting interoperability category, but more importantly, would allow pathologists show their value in alternative payment models. still, as we expressed in comments on the cy 2019 pfs proposed rule, we have concerns about increasing the cehrt use criterion for apms to qualify as advanced apms because this\n\n\n 5\n college of american pathologists 1001 g street, nw, suite 425w washington, dc 20001 800-392-9994 | cap.org\n could create additional barriers for advanced apm participation. finally, we have previously supported cms guidelines for acos that encourage bi-directional exchange of data between the laboratory and other patient information, allowing laboratory pathologists easy access to patient data across the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ehr and allowing other clinicians easy access to readable and actionable data from the laboratory.\n while not directly mentioned in this proposed rule, the cap would again emphasize that health information technology vendors continue to block information through financial, technical, and contractual means. the cap believes that ehr vendors continue to create barriers to access patient information. these barriers interfere with and materially discourage physician and patient access to information. the cap\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience through its qualified clinical data registry (qcdr), known as the pathologists quality registry (pqr), has been that some ehr vendors make it difficult for the transfer of patient information to clinical data registries. while some ehr vendors have negotiated with physicians and third-party software companies, other ehr vendors tack on large fees to send data from the ehr to clinical data registries or to even connect to a health information exchange. cms should explore fundamental issues of data blocking that continue to hinder interoperability and identify appropriate methods to address them.\n summary\n the cap is committed to increasing the availability and adoption of innovative payment models, like acos, that afford an opportunity for the participation of pathologists. the importance of pathologists comes in their ability, unique among medical specialties, to collect and analyze data related to patient testing and diagnosis. these activities provide the infrastructure and foundation for effective and appropriate care. still, more changes are needed to appropriately recognize the role of pathologists in successfully achieving the aco goals of reducing costs and improving quality and safety. policy changes should be avoided that would unnecessarily lead to a drop in the number of acos; appropriate measures must be developed for providers who typically do not furnish services that involve face-to-face interaction with patients; and cms must consider the contributions of diagnostic specialties in the exchange of electronic patient data. further, as we have stated previously, more opportunities are needed for specialty providers of all kinds to participate under the advanced apm track of medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality payment program. the cap looks forward to continuing our conversation with cms to ensure pathologists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to participate in acos and other alternative payment models and to contribute to effective delivery system reform.\n\n *   *   *   *   *\n\n", "0331": "see

to success proposed rule\n dear administrator verma:\n on behalf of 142 hospitals and health systems serving medicare beneficiaries throughout our state, including many that participate in the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and other accountable care organization (aco) initiatives, the minnesota hospital association (mha) is pleased to have the opportunity to submit the following comments regarding the pathways to success proposed rule.\n minnesota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hospitals and health systems are proud of our reputation for seeking new and better ways to provide higher quality care and reduce total costs of care. accordingly, our members have participated in the mssp program, next gen aco, and our medicaid program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innovative integrated health partnership demonstration project. in almost every case, health care delivery systems taking on a total-cost-of-care (tcoc) arrangement find that they need a few years to develop the necessary analytical competencies and financial management necessary to succeed.\n based on our members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experience, we are concerned that the proposed rule and other statements from the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) indicate that the agency intends to abruptly end otherwise successful or promising mssp acos if the participating health systems are not willing to take on downside financial risk. we understand the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in accelerating transformation in the delivery of care and capturing greater financial savings from these arrangements. however, by chopping off the competency development process necessary to succeed under a tcoc program, cms is likely to generate two undesirable outcomes: (1) provider systems already participating in shared savings programs who are on the cusp of being able to take downside risk with a little more time will drop out of the program and return to the misaligned incentives of the fee-for-service (ffs) payment system, and (2) provider systems that are ready to begin shifting to an aco model will decide to forgo these programs even though they might have improved care for medicare beneficiaries and generated considerable savings.\n\n seema verma october 16, 2018 page 2\n\n in fact, in gathering our members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 input for these comments, one of our health systems indicated that if cms finalizes the rule as proposed, it will be forced to decide whether to stay in the aco program before it has received its performance data for even one single year or drop out of the program. cms should be supporting more data-driven decision-making processes in all aspects of care delivery, but the proposed rule runs counter to this objective.\n mha respectfully requests that cms reconsider the proposed approach or, as a less preferred alternative, stagger the implementation of this new policy so it applies on july 1, 2019 as proposed to those acos that have been in the mssp program the longest, and would go into effect on january 1, 2020 for organizations that joined the program more recently, and january 2, 2021 for organizations that began their aco journey in 2018.\n another request we have raised in previous comments is to ask cms to consider avenues to include medicare advantage enrollees in an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed population. this is especially important in minnesota because our residents have one of the highest rates of medicare advantage enrollment in the country. as a result, minnesota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medicare acos are being benchmarked on a much smaller portion of the total medicare population they serve. moreover, by developing options for including medicare advantage enrollees in aco programs, cms will help better align measures and incentives across a larger population, thereby increasing these models\u00e2\u0080\u0099 effectiveness and efficiency. this option would make it easier for providers in rural communities to reach a critical mass of enrollees necessary to participate in these models.\n mha is grateful for cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interest in mechanisms to create more direct incentives for enrollees to engage more actively in their care, and to ease medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s restrictions on the use of telehealth technology to deliver services. these are positive steps and mha agrees with cms that they will benefit enrollees and the medicare program overall. we strongly encourage cms to consider easing these restrictions for providers who are not participating in an aco since the benefits of these activities will accrue to enrollees and the medicare program regardless of the metrics and payment models their providers are under. better care is better care, whether you are attributed to an aco or not.\n with respect to other provisions in the proposed rule, mha supports and echoes the comments provided by the american hospital association in its letter submitted today.\n if you have any questions about our comments, please feel free to contact me.\n sincerely,\n matthew l. anderson, j.d. senior vice president of policy and chief strategy officer\n\n", "0333":

transforming health care through innovative medical education, cutting-edge patient care, and groundbreaking medical research. its members are all 151 accredited u.s. and 17 accredited canadian medical schools; nearly 400 major teaching hospitals and health systems, including 51 department of veterans affairs medical centers; and more than 80 academic societies. through these institutions and organizations, the aamc serves the leaders of america\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s medical schools and teaching hospitals and their more than 173,000 full-time faculty members, 89,000 medical students, 129,000 resident physicians, and more than 60,000 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the biomedical sciences.\n\n the aamc supports alternative payment model (apm) programs, such as accountable care organizations (acos) and bundled payment initiatives, that seek to promote high-quality, efficient care while retaining at their core the essential patient-physician relationship. many academic medical centers (amcs) are participating in new payment models, including the medicare shared savings program (mssp or the program), next generation aco model, the bundled payments for care improvement (bpci) advanced model, the oncology care model, and others.\n\n the mssp has the potential to reduce costs, improve quality of care, and promote collaboration and care coordination. we urge cms to establish policies that encourage increased participation in the\n aco program so that the program can achieve its long-term goals.\n\n summary of issues on which aamc provides comments\n the following items are the aamc\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s recommendations on key proposals:\n\n administrator verma october 16, 2018\n page 2\n acos should be permitted more years in upside-only risk arrangements: cms should allow all new acos to be in basic levels a-b (shared savings only) for 4 years before requiring the acos to move to level c (downside risk). acos that demonstrate contained cost growth relative to medicare cost growth and perform well on quality should be allowed 5 years with no downside risk.\n\n the enhanced track should always be optional: all acos should be allowed to remain indefinitely in a basic level e arrangement rather than being forced to move to the higher risk enhanced track. additionally, cms should develop more options for gradual risk increases between basic level e and enhanced.\n\n basic savings sharing rates should not be reduced: cms should not finalize the reduction from the current shared savings rate of 50 percent. cms should maintain the 50 percent sharing rate for upside-only levels and gradually increase the sharing rates from level c up to level e to recognize the downside risk acos take on in those arrangements.\n aco participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 fee-for-service (ffs) revenue should not be used to create distinctions: cms should not create different participation

revenue.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 the proposed revenue standard is arbitrary and does not reflect an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s actual ability to bear greater financial risk.\n\n 5-year agreements: cms should finalize the proposal to move to 5-year agreement periods to promote stability and predictability for acos.\n\n cost performance alone should not be cause for involuntary termination: cms should not finalize its proposal to broaden the agency\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s authority to terminate an aco based on its financial performance relative to the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s minimum savings rate/minimum loss rate.\n\n partial performance-based risk for voluntary termination should align with the quality payment program (qpp): acos taking on downside risk that wish to voluntarily terminate during a performance year should only be at risk for pro-rated reconciliation if they remain at risk through august 31, in line with the qpp performance period.\n\n cap on risk adjustment should not be limited to 3 percent over 5 years. cms should finalize its proposal to risk adjust for newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries and, at a minimum, should establish an annual cap of 3% on risk score growth to best ensure that year- over-year changes in patient complexity and health status are appropriately accounted for.\n incorporating regional adjustments to the benchmark should be flexible to allow for all acos to succeed: cms should provide maximum flexibility and choice to acos and allow different approaches to phase-in regional blends to the benchmark.\n\n annual written beneficiary notification is unlikely to strengthen beneficiary engagement: cms should not implement burdensome annual notification requirements for acos and instead should permit acos greater flexibility to communicate with patients about the program.\n\n additional ffs benefit enhancement flexibility should be implemented in 2019: cms should expand the use of the existing skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver and implement the broader availability of telehealth services for the 2019 performance year.\n specialists should not be included for voluntary alignment: cms should consider protections from unintended consequences that may result from the inclusion of specialists.\n\n administrator verma

will depend on potential financial opportunities being adequate to support the investments needed to improve quality and coordinate care. the mssp has grown in recent years and now includes 561 acos covering 10.5 million beneficiaries.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 acos have been leaders in the shift to value-based care. recent reports have shown that acos have improved quality and have generated net savings to medicare. a 2017 health and human services (hhs) office of inspector general (oig) report entitled \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3medicare shared savings accountable care organizations have shown potential for reducing spending and improving quality\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 found acos achieved high quality performance with a score of 90.5 percent out of 100 percent for performance year 2017.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 the 2017 mssp performance year results showed net savings of $314 million to the medicare trust funds.* in its june 2018 report, the medicare payment advisory commission (medpac) also referenced several peer reviewed studies that found savings from the program.*\n for the program to achieve its long-term goals, cms should set forth policies that encourage participation by establishing incentives for acos to increase quality and reduce costs. one of our chief concerns with this proposed rule is that the combination of requiring downside risk for spending in excess of benchmarks after year one or two of the program, earlier blending of historic benchmarks with regional benchmarks, and reduced shared savings rates will result in many acos exiting the mssp program and discourage participation by new acos in the future.\n\n redesigning participation options\n creating a basic track with glide path to performance-based risk\n cms proposes to redesign the program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participation options by discontinuing track 1, track 2 and the deferred renewal option, and instead offering two tracks that eligible acos would enter into for an agreement period of at least 5 years:\n\n (1) basic track, which would include an option for eligible acos to begin participation under a one-sided model and incrementally phase-in risk and potential reward over the course of a single agreement period, an approach referred to as a glide path; and\n (2) enhanced track, based on the program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s existing track 3, for acos that take on the highest level of risk and potential reward.\n\n\n\n ' centers for medicare & medicaid services, medicare shared

proposes a glide path that includes 5 levels: a one-sided risk model available only for the first 2 consecutive performance years of a 5-year agreement period (levels a and b), and three levels of progressively higher risk and potential reward in performance years 3 through 5 of the agreement period (levels c, d, and e). acos would be automatically advanced at the start of each participation year until they reach the track\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s maximum level of risk/reward (designed to be the same as track 1+ model).\n\n with respect to participation options within the basic track, acos new to the program would have the flexibility to enter the glide path at any one of the five levels. acos that previously participated in track 1 (or anew aco in which a specified percentage of its aco participants have recent prior experience in track 1) would be ineligible to enter the glide path at level a (thereby limiting their participation in one-sided risk). for aco participants with recent prior experience in a track 1 aco, level e must be entered into no later than the fourth performance year. special rules apply for so- called \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3low revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 acos that have experience in aco initiatives and would otherwise be required to be at level e of the basic track.\n\n cms should allow acos to participate in basic, in an upside-only level, for at least 4 years before transitioning to downside-risk\n the aamc has major concerns with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to require risk for spending in excess of benchmarks (downside risk) after 2 years (and in some cases, after 1 year) in the basic track. we urge cms to not finalize this proposal. instead, we recommend that cms allow all new acos to be in levels a-b (shared savings only) for 4 years before requiring the acos to move to level c (downside risk). additionally, acos that demonstrate contained cost growth relative to medicare cost growth and perform well on quality should be allowed 5 years with no downside risk.\n these acos are demonstrating progress and movement toward assuming risk in the future. the reasons that shared savings only models should be allowed for a longer period of time are enumerated below.\n\n e aggressive push to downside risk could slow movement from volume to value-based payment due to insufficient time to prepare for risk.\n\n mssp track | is the most popular option for acos, representing 82 percent of mssp acos in 2018. currently, many acos remain in track | after the first agreement period because they are unprepared to assume downside risk yet. to assume risk, acos need predictability and positive performance results. the ability to assume downside risk depends on a variety of factors, such as local market, leadership, financial status, resources required to address social determinants of health, and number of patients with complex conditions.\n\n to prepare for changes, the acos also need to have a sufficient amount of performance data from prior years. under cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal acos would have only one year of performance data before shifting to downside risk. this does not allow time for taking steps to improve performance to ensure success in the program in future years.\n\n it takes time for acos to gain experience with the program and to start to produce consistent savings. research shows that acos improve over time in the program. it takes the average aco that earned savings in 2017 three years to initially generate savings. of the 142 acos that earned shared savings payments in 2017 and had prior program experience 36 percent had losses in one of their first two years in the program. two years is not sufficient time to prepare for downside risk. acos need to be able to commit to a risk path on a timeline that they can achieve.\n\n administrator verma october 16, 2018 page 5\n surveys suggest that an aggressive push to \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3two-sided risk\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 arrangements in the mssp could cause many of the current track 1 aco participants to drop out of the mssp and would discourage other providers from participating in the future. this could slow the movement of providers from volume to value-based payments. cms needs to balance the goals of transitioning providers to payment models with more financial risk while also retaining participation of those willing to work on value- based models.\n\n e acos incur significant risk to participate in aco models, including in one-sided risk arrangements\n it is important to recognize that there is financial \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3risk\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 involved in one-sided aco models, such as track 1. acos incur significant costs to participate in the mssp, including costs for clinical and care management, health it, population analytics and tracking, redesign of care processes, and management. acos will lose money if they do not earn enough shared savings to offset the costs of participation.\n\n e acos have demonstrated success in reducing medicare spending without accepting downside risk\n the majority of track 1 acos have reduced medicare spending relative to cms benchmarks even though they are not subject to downside risk. the mssp performance year 2017 results show net savings to the medicare trust fund of $314 million after accounting for shared savings payments made to acos. it is important to note that many acos generate savings by having expenditures lower than their benchmark even though they do not surpass the minimum savings rate and thus do not qualify for earned savings. while they do not earn shared savings, these acos are still saving money for the medicare trust fund and are demonstrating an increasing likelihood of achieving shared savings over time. this is likely due to experience in the program and investments in care coordination, quality and analytics. cms should encourage their continued participation in the program.\n\n e acos have demonstrated that they outperform fee-for-service (ffs) providers on quality\n another important factor to consider is that shared savings only acos have improved quality of care. the hhs oig report? from august 2017 found that acos outperformed medicare ffs providers on 81 percent (22 of 27) of the individual quality measures and performed better than 90 percent of all ffs providers when looking at hospital readmissions. these findings confirm that acos are providing high quality care to the medicare beneficiaries they treat and continue to improve quality over time. therefore, it is critical for cms to continue to support these efforts and not force acos that perform well on quality to assume downside risk when they are not ready.\n\n acos that score at or above the 50 percentile in quality in 2 years of participation in the program have clearly invested significantly in data analytics software, clinical improvements, staff training, and operational changes to achieve high-performance on aco quality metrics. though these acos may not have earned sufficient shared savings relative to their benchmarks to allow them the financial readiness to assume risk, they have demonstrated high quality care and should be given additional time (at least 4 years) prior to being forced into taking on downside risk.\n\n\n\n > hhs oig, medicare shared savings accountable care organizations have shown potential for reducing spending and improving quality (2017) available at https://oig.hhs.gov/oei rts/oe1-02-15-00450.asp\n administrator verma october 16, 2018 page 6\n cms should reduce risk associated with moving from basic to enhanced\n cms proposes a gradual glidepath for risk under the basic track but does not propose a similar glide from basic level e to enhanced. there is a significant increase in financial risk an aco must assume when it must transition from basic level e to the enhanced track. the enhanced track requires maximum losses based on total cost of care and it is capped at almost 4 times the amount in the basic level e. cms acknowledges this significant increase and requests feedback.\n\n we urge cms to create a revenue-based loss sharing limit for the enhanced track and to create more options for gradual risk increases between basic level e and enhanced. it is important that cms not force acos into a model with levels of risk that they are unable to assume.\n acos that are not ready for such high levels of risk will exit the program. many acos have generated savings to the medicare program while improving the quality of patient care. we urge cms to continue to enable them to participate in the program. we recommend that cms allow all acos to remain indefinitely in basic level e rather than being forced to the enhanced track.\n\n cms should maintain a 50 percent shared rate for levels a-b and increase the rate for levels\n in the basic track, cms proposes to set the rate at which an aco can share in savings to a maximum of 25 percent for levels a and b, 30 percent for level c, 40 percent for level d, and 50 percent for level e. this represents a significant reduction in the sharing rate for levels a-d compared the current sharing rate of 50 percent for track 1. the enhanced track would have a sharing rate of up to 75 percent (unchanged from the current rate for track 3).\n\n the aamc strongly opposes the reduction from the current shared savings rate of 50 percent.\n instead, we recommend that cms maintain a 50 percent sharing rate for levels a-b and increase the savings rate for levels c-d to 55 percent and the rate for level e to 60 percent, in recognition of the level of downside risk.\n\n to incentivize acos to lower spending, it is important to enable acos to share in the savings.\n establishing a shared savings rate that is too low (e.g. 25 percent) limits the opportunities for the aco to benefit relative to the status quo because, as has been described above, the acos incur substantial costs simply for participating in the program. this includes the costs of governance and operations, quality reporting, and efforts to redesign care. the proposal to reduce the shared savings rate in all levels of the basic track except level e is likely to eliminate opportunities for acos to save, might reduce aco investments in the program, and would ultimately discourage participation in the program.\n\n instead of attempting to set policies that would make savings-only models less appealing, we recommend cms focus on making models with downside risk more attractive while also supporting shared savings only models.\n\n\n\n differentiating acos on the basis of ffs revenue of aco participants is arbitrary and will likely lead to less participation by hospitals\n cms proposes to create a new distinction to define acos as either high or low revenue, with that determination creating separate and distinct options for how that aco may participate in the\n administrator verma october 16, 2018 page 7\n program going forward. cms proposes to define revenue determinations by the parts a and b ffs revenue of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participants (ffs billing by tax identification numbers, or tins) for the most recent calendar year for which data is available as compared to the expenditures of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s aligned beneficiaries for the same calendar year. if the ffs revenue of its participants is at least 25 percent of that of the total expenditures for its beneficiaries, the aco would be considered high revenue. if less than 25 percent, it is low revenue. in calculating aco revenue, cms proposes to include hospital add-on payments such as indirect medical education (ime), disproportionate share hospital (dsh) adjustment, and uncompensated care costs (ucc), but not include those same payments when calculating beneficiary expenditures.\n\n acos determined to be high revenue under the proposal would be limited in their ability to participate in the basic track of the program (if at all) and be pushed to take on two-sided risk sooner. cms claims that this approach is intended to evaluate an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s ability to control expenditures, and thus be able to take on greater levels of performance-based risk. in general, cms notes that \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3low revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 acos tend to be smaller, physician-led, and less likely to have access to capital necessary to assume risk.\n\n the aamc opposes categorizing acos by ffs revenue and urges cms to not finalize the proposed revenue distinctions. the reasons that there should be no distinction based on revenue are enumerated below:\n\n e revenue does not equal control or ability to bear risk\n medicare revenue is not synonymous with an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s ability to control beneficiary expenditures.\n cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed approach does not measure how much of the beneficiary expenditures flows through the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participants (1.e., that 25 percent or more of the beneficiary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s expenditures were billed by aco participants). furthermore, medicare revenue does not capture ownership or external private investment in the formation and management of an aco. research shows that insurers and venture capital funds are investing millions of dollars in certain acos, which are often physician- led, and cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed approach would not capture such private investment when determining the revenue of aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s participants.\n\n e inclusion of add-on payments in revenue calculation unfairly penalizes teaching\n hy, ity]\n i and academic medical centers\n including ime, dsh, and ucc payments in the calculation of aco revenue, but not in the expenditures calculation unfairly penalizes the teaching hospitals that receive such add-on payments.\n it is also inconsistent with program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s policy to exclude these add-on payments from both the benchmarks and performance year expenditures calculations because the agency does \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3not wish to incentivize acos to avoid these types of providers that receive these payments.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5\u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ab this policy alone will make it less likely that acos engage teaching hospitals as aco participants. the medicare program has long recognized the higher costs associated with the important societal roles of teaching hospitals and has provided ime and dsh payments to help offset these costs. in addition to training future physicians and other health care professionals, teaching hospitals treat the sickest and most complex medicare patients. they have higher case mix indices and treat a disproportionate share of outlier cases. these institutions also receive the majority of transfers from other hospitals when\n\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u0096\u0091medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 pathways to success, 83 fed. reg. 41786, 41809 (august 17, 2018)\n\n administrator verma october 16, 2018 page 8\n patients need more sophisticated diagnostic and treatment services than other providers can deliver.\n\n finalizing the inclusion of these hospital add-on payments in the revenue calculation will give acos a strong incentive not to include teaching hospitals in their networks. this will not only affect teaching hospitals but also the vulnerable beneficiaries treated by these hospitals because they will have limited access to the care coordination efforts, enhanced services like the skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver and telehealth, and additional future beneficiary incentive programs available through acos to the vulnerable populations disproportionally treated by teaching hospitals and academic medical centers.\n\n e cms policies should drive all providers to collaborate\n the best way to drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate to innovate and deliver high quality, cost effective health care. medpac addressed this in its june 2018 report\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 noting that while hospitals may have certain conflicting interests that create challenges for aco participation, the commission recommends hospitals should continue to be part of acos. rather than finalize unnecessary and arbitrary distinctions for acos, cms should work to support all acos as they progress on the value-based care continuum, and the agency should create meaningful incentives for acos to assume risk. the goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients. cms should adopt policies that continue to engage hospitals as key players rather than create incentives to exclude hospitals as aco participants.\n\n 5-year agreement periods transitioning to 5-year agreement periods promotes stability and predictability for acos\n in an effort to provide stability and certainty for acos, cms proposes to move to longer agreement periods by revising the definition of \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3agreement period.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 cms proposes to modify the definition at 42 c.f.r. \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 425.200 that agreements beginning in 2020 and subsequent years will have a term of participation of 5 years, instead of 3 years. cms proposes agreement periods of 5 years and 6 months for agreements beginning july 1, 2019 to balance the transition to longer agreements with adequate time for acos to apply to participate in the program under the proposed modified terms. we support this proposal.\n\n one motivation for this proposal is that longer agreement periods could improve program incentives and support acos by providing greater stability and certainty over benchmarks. this is in part because benchmarks are set at the beginning of the agreement period, and then adjusted annually based upon changes to the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s certified aco participant list, changes to the assignment of beneficiaries, annual risk adjustment, and annual benchmark updates. additionally, extended agreement periods would delay the effects of benchmark rebasing by 2 years (relative to a 3-year agreement).\n\n while not expressly noted by cms, another benefit of a longer agreement term would be the longer periods of participation in the program between application cycles for acos. this allows more time for acos to focus on current participation without needing to balance future participation\n\n\n \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 medicare payment advisory commission, report to the congress: medicare and the health care delivery system

aamc supports longer agreement periods as it will help promote stability and predictability for acos participating in the program.\n\n permitting annual participation options\n permitting acos to elect its beneficiary assignment methodology annually allows greater flexibility and tailoring of participation for acos\n cms proposes to implement section 50331 of the bipartisan budget act (bba) of 2018 by allowing all acos to choose the prospective beneficiary assignment methodology for an agreement period (instead of preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation beneficiary assignment methodology). going further, in response to stakeholder interest in allowing more flexibility for acos, cms proposes to provide additional flexibility to permit acos to elect the beneficiary assignment methodology annually for each performance year within an agreement period. an aco would choose its beneficiary assignment methodology at the time of its application to enter or renew its participation in the program, and then have an annual opportunity to notify cms of its intent to change its assignment methodology in advance of the next performance year under the agreement. the aamc supports this additional flexibility for acos and recommends that cms finalize this policy as proposed.\n\n cms should permit an annual election of the minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss rate (mlr)\n\n cms also proposes to permit the election of different levels of risk within the basic track\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s glide path under a new proposed policy (42 c.f.r. \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 425.601) whereby an aco can elect to transition more quickly from a one-sided level to a two-sided level. as part of the proposal, when an aco transitions to a downside risk taking level it will elect a symmetric msr/mlr that will apply for the remainder of the agreement period under performance-based risk. permitting annual elections is a critical tool that can encourage acos to try new approaches and transition to higher levels of risk and reward; however, without additional flexibility related to the msr/mlr selection, acos will not have the full opportunity to meaningfully tailor their participation. given the extended 5-year agreement period proposed by cms, it is that much more important that cms allow acos to select their msr/mlr prior to the start of each performance year rather than be locked into that selection for up to 5 years. the aamc supports the agency\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s efforts to add annual elections to the program to incorporate additional flexibility for acos, but also recommends that cms carry that logic further and adopt an additional election policy to permit acos to modify their msr/mlr selection annually.\n\n early termination & voluntary termination\n cost performance alone should not be cause for involuntary termination\n cms proposes to amend the program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s regulations to allow the agency to monitor an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s financial performance and take early termination action against the aco, in addition to current policy which allows the agency to terminate an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s agreement for program integrity concerns.\n specifically, cms proposed to monitor whether an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s expenditures for its assigned beneficiaries exceed the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s negative minimum savings rate (msr), under a one-sided model, or its minimum loss rate (mlr), if under a two-sided model. if the aco is negative outside the\n administrator verma october 16, 2018 page 10\n applicable \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3corridor\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 for a performance year, cms proposes to add to the regulations authority for the agency to take pre-termination actions, including a corrective action plan (cap). if the aco is negative outside the corridor for a second performance year, cms proposes to allow the agency to immediately or with advance notice (30 days) terminate that aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s agreement.\n\n the proposed msr/mlr standard sets a low bar, especially considering that acos in a two-sided risk model can forgo an msr/mlr altogether (by setting it at 0 percent). this policy would disincentivize acos from taking on greater risk/reward via its msr/mlr selection, because the aco could be kicked out of the program if it fails to achieve cost savings in a given year.\n furthermore, setting the performance threshold at the msr/mlr is redundant for acos in downside risk, as they are already accountable for repaying their shared losses if their expenditures exceed their benchmarks outside of the mlr.\n\n to demonstrate that the proposed policy is far too broad, consider that acos participating in one- sided risk are often early in their transition to practicing value-based care, and may not be able to achieve immediate savings. in reviewing 2017 performance, of the 142 acos that earned shared savings payments and had prior program experience, 51 had losses in one of their first two years in the program. had the proposed policy been in place, they would have been put under a cap and may have been removed from the program prematurely.\n\n understanding that cms is considering broader scope of its authority to terminate acos that are \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3bad actors,\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 the aamc suggests that the cms consider more appropriate standards of poor financial performance that are more tailored to the agency\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s intent. one approach might consider a standard that looks at the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s cost growth relative to national expenditure growth trends to demonstrate that the aco is an outlier requiring corrective action. for example, cms could monitor acos based on whether the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s expenditure trend is substantially higher than the national expenditure growth trend, such as 5 percentage points higher, and take the pre-termination action in those cases, rather than based on the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s selected msr/mlr. should the agency move forward with any type of early termination policy, at a minimum it should be used only in rare cases where the agency has documented program integrity concerns. the aamc does not support this policy and urges cms not finalize it as proposed.\n\n the voluntary termination notice deadline should be extended to august 31 to trigger partial reconciliation for a performance year\n cms also proposes to change the policies governing an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s voluntary termination of its agreement. cms proposes to reduce the minimum notification period to 30 days (from 60 days) for an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s voluntary early termination from the program. in addition, cms proposes to require that acos in two-sided risk models that voluntarily terminate effective after june 30 share in pro-rated losses using the full 12 months of performance year expenditure data. cms also proposes to pro-rate shared losses for any aco that is involuntarily terminated at any point in the performance year that was participating in a two-sided risk model.\n\n the aamc has concerns regarding the june 30 proposed deadline for an aco to voluntarily terminate from the program without financial risk of sharing in losses if in a two-sided risk model.\n acos do not have sufficient performance year data by june 30 to make an informed decision about continued participation in the program, as they would only have one quarter of performance year data and would not have the final reconciliation with final risk adjustment for the prior performance year (if applicable), due to the timing performance reports.\n\n administrator verma october 16, 2018 page 11\n the june 30 cutoff also has an interaction with the quality payment programs in regard to acos participating in a track/level that qualifies as an advanced alternative payment model (aapm)\n because the performance period for qualifying participants (qps) in an aapm ends august 31 (but includes qualifying snapshots on march 31 and june 30). in setting a june 30 financial risk deadline, cms could potentially strip an aco subject to financial risk from appropriate qp aapm status.\n instead, cms could align prorated financial risk with the qpp performance period, creating better synergy between popular aapm policy and qpp policy. considering the timing of actionable performance data and the qpp performance period, the aamc recommends that cms modify its proposal to hold an aco accountable for a portion of shared losses only if the aco terminates effective on or after august 31.\n\n benchmarking methodology refinements\n risk adjustment methodology cms should risk adjust the benchmark to better reflect patient complexity\n cms proposes to change the program\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s risk adjustment methodology to use cms-hcc prospective risk scores to adjust the historical benchmark for changes in severity and case mix for al/ assigned beneficiaries, subject to a symmetrical cap of positive or negative 3 percent for the agreement period, for agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019, and in subsequent years. this approach would eliminate the current distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries.\n\n we strongly support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries. however, we believe the 3 percent cap over 5 years is insufficient. as proposed by cms, the 3 percent cap is across a 5-year period and not a year-over- year increase. a cap of 3 percent is arbitrary and not sufficient when applied across five years, considering that many acos could exceed the 3 percent cap in the first performance year of an agreement period. instead, we recommend that cms amend the policy to apply, at a minimum, the symmetric 3 percent risk adjustment cap annually. this will preserve further stability and better reflect the clinical complexity and patient characteristics of an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s population. it is essential for an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmarks to be adjusted annually for continuously assigned beneficiaries when there is a genuine change in health and risk status of their patient population. acos who have made genuine improvement in their patients should see a downward adjustment if the patients get healthier and an upward adjustment if their health status worsens.\n\n cms should also apply changes to its medicare advantage risk adjustment methodology to the medicare shared savings acos. specifically, cms announced in its medicare advantage 2017 advance notice and draft call letter its plans to refine the risk adjustment model to improve the accuracy of payments to plans serving beneficiaries who are low income and dually eligible for medicare and medicaid. applying a risk adjustment methodology that accounts for low income beneficiaries to acos would be particularly beneficial to acos that include teaching hospitals and academic medical centers as participants, as they typically serve a higher number of low income patients with more complex conditions and should not risk penalty for doing so.\n\n administrator verma october 16, 2018 page 12\n benchmarking methodology\n cms should provide maximum flexibility and choices to acos for incorporating regional adjustments to the benchmarking methodology\n cms proposes to incorporate regional expenditures into benchmarks beginning with initial agreement periods, rather than beginning with an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s second agreement period. the agency also proposes to cap the maximum amount of regional expenditures at 50 percent. specifically, acos would have the following blended regional expenditure component incorporated:\n\n e first agreement period - 25 or 35 percent (the higher rate would apply if aco spending is lower than its region);\n e second agreement period \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 35 or 50 percent during the second agreement period; and\n e third and subsequent agreement periods - 50 percent.\n\n cms also proposes to introduce a symmetric +/- 5 percent cap, implemented separately for each beneficiary category and based on national per capita expenditures.\n\n creating appropriate benchmarks for acos is a key to success and is essential for keeping those acos engaged in the program. the aamc is generally supportive of cms incorporating a portion of regional cost data in in the benchmark. however, we have some concerns about the application of a 25 or 35 percent regional expenditure amount in the first agreement period. while we recognize that regional expenditure cost data in the benchmark can be beneficial, we think it is important not to rely exclusively on regional cost data as there could be acos that have complex patient populations that would necessitate use of a greater portion of historical costs in the benchmark. therefore, we support the concept of using a blend of historical and regional cost data to establish aco benchmarks that would be phased in more gradually than the cms proposal.\n\n we believe cms should provide maximum flexibility and choices to acos and allow different approaches to transition to any new benchmarking methodology, primarily a more gradual phase-in of the regional blend in the first agreement period for acos with costs higher than their regions. for example, cms could apply a 10 percent blend in performance years | and 2, 20 percent in year 2 and 3, and 30 percent in year 5 of the first agreement period. if cms adopts its proposal to include regional blends to the benchmark in the first agreement period, cms should monitor the impact on participation in the aco shared savings program by provider type, including academic medical centers and make refinements as needed to ensure sustained participation.\n\n regional service area should include counties of residence where more than i percent of assigned beneficiaries reside\n in the 2016 aco rule, cms defined the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s regional service area based on counties of residence of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s assigned beneficiaries. there could be multiple counties included in the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s regional service area. an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s region would include any county where one or more beneficiaries assigned to that aco reside. cms would weight the county level ffs costs by the proportion of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s assigned beneficiaries in the county. therefore, if only one beneficiary resides in the county, the county would have a very small weight in the calculation of the benchmark. while we support basing the regions on counties in which the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s beneficiaries reside, we believe that the threshold of one beneficiary is too low.\n\n the aamc has heard from multiple amcs that participate in acos that it is common for them to have assigned beneficiaries that reside far away from the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s general service area. academic\n administrator verma october 16, 2018 page 13\n medical centers tend to be destinations for specialized care, drawing patients from around the country and the world with specific and complex health care needs. if cms adopts this threshold, acos with amcs could have many different regions of the country included in their benchmark calculation even if they care for only one patient who resides in a particular county. we recommend cms increase the threshold to one percent of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s assigned beneficiary population, as cms did in the physician group practice demonstration, for example. this will reduce complexity and result in a better reflection of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s general regional service area.\n\n cms should remove aco-assigned beneficiaries from the regional service area population calculation\n in determining the regional expenditures for resetting the benchmark, cms calculates ffs costs for all assignable beneficiaries including those who have been assigned to the aco. cms states that \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3assignable beneficiaries, are medicare ffs beneficiaries that received at least one primary care visit from any medicare primary care physician or physician with a primary care specialty designation for purposes of aco assignment during the 12-month assigned period window.\n\n aamc supports limiting the beneficiary population to \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3assignable beneficiaries.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 beneficiaries who have not received a primary care service during the time frame should be excluded as they would inappropriately lower the expenditures against which the aco would be compared. however, if the aco-assigned beneficiary population remains in the calculation of expenditures, the regional cost data could be skewed by the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s efforts to coordinate care and reduce expenditures for the aco assigned beneficiaries. therefore, we urge cms to remove aco-assigned beneficiaries from the regional service area reference population so that an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s performance is compared relative to the ffs population instead of the aco population.\n\n cms should continue exclusion of ime, dsh, and uncompensated care from benchmarks\n the aamc continues to strongly support the exclusion of ime, dsh and uncompensated care payments from an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s benchmark and performance year calculations. we are pleased to see in this rule cms remains committed to its policy of excluding these add-on payments. this policy is necessary to protect beneficiary access to necessary care at teaching hospitals. the medicare program has long recognized the higher costs associated with the important societal roles of teaching hospitals and has provided dgme, ime, and dsh payments to help offset these costs. in addition to training future physicians and other health care professionals, teaching hospitals treat the sickest and most complex medicare patients. they have higher case mix indices and treat a disproportionate share of outlier cases. these institutions also receive the majority of transfers from other hospitals when patients need more sophisticated and diagnostic and treatment services than other providers can deliver.\n\n to include these policy add-on payments in aco benchmarks would give acos a strong financial incentive to find savings by steering patients away from teaching hospitals rather than through redesigned and improved care which are the goals of the program. continuing to exclude ime, dgme, and dsh payments from the benchmark and performance calculations will help ensure that decisions by acos will be based on clinical determinations that are in the best interests of the patient.\n\n cms should account for savings in rebased benchmarks we urge cms to adjust rebased historical benchmarks to recognize savings in expenditures that a\n successful aco achieves during its first agreement period. specifically, cms should add a portion\n 13\n administrator verma october 16, 2018 page 14\n of the savings from the previous agreement into the rebased benchmark to encourage ongoing participating in the program. acos that invest in care coordination and quality improvement and lower expenditures should be rewarded.\n\n providing tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n beneficiary incentives cms should consider administrative burden when finalizing incentive program policies\n cms proposes to allow any aco in track 2, levels c, d, or e of the basic track, or the enhanced track to establish a cms-approved beneficiary incentive program to provide incentive payments to eligible beneficiaries who receive qualifying services. as required by the bipartisan budget act of 2018 (bba), cms proposes a $20 payment limit, updated annually consistent with the consumer price index and rounded to the nearest dollar, and made no later than 30 days after the service. a beneficiary would be eligible to receive an incentive payment if the beneficiary is assigned to an aco through either preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation or prospective assignment. cms proposes that the aco legal entity must furnish the incentive directly to the beneficiary, and that the payment may only be a cash equivalent (e.g., a check or rewards card)\n and not cash. the aco would be responsible for funding the costs of operating an incentive program, including funding the cost of the incentive payments, and must keep records of all incentives paid out to assigned beneficiaries. acos would not be allowed to accept or use funds from outside entities (including but not limited to an insurance company or a pharmaceutical company) to finance its incentive program. acos would be required to publicly report annually the total number of incentive payments furnished, the hcpcs codes associated any qualifying payments for which an incentive was furnished, the total value of all incentive payment furnished, and the total type of each incentive payment.\n\n the aamc supports cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to implement the bba\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s vision of a beneficiary incentive program for acos taking on downside risk. because cms would require acos to fully fund the costs and administration of such a program, the aamc asks that cms consider reviewing initial uptake of the option to offer incentive programs and whether the result is that only acos in certain markets or with similar profiles are available to take advantage of the opportunity (for example, acos serving wealthier, suburban beneficiary populations rather than those serving urban or rural populations). in the event that cms observes incentive programs are not widely available to beneficiaries, the aamc recommends that cms consider novel ways to finance programs through \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3pre-payments\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 of shared savings to acos or other capital-funding concepts.\n\n empowering beneficiary choice requiring beneficiary notifications is unlikely to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n cms proposes to modify the current beneficiary notification requirements (informational signs in participant facilities and physician offices and written notification upon request) and, in addition, would require a standard written notification be provided annually to a// medicare ffs beneficiaries at their first primary care visit of the performance year in the form and manner specified by cms.\n beginning july 1, 2019, the aco would also be required to inform the patient about the beneficiary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s ability to identify, or change identification of a primary care provider, for purposes of voluntary alignment. the proposal is designed to ensure that beneficiaries have a sufficient opportunity to be\n administrator verma october 16, 2018 page 15\n informed about the program and how it may affect their care and health data.\n\n the agency previously required annual written notification to beneficiaries and abandoned that policy in response to confusion among beneficiaries and aco feedback related to operational burden. the proposal for a written notification at the place of service is administratively complex and cost prohibitive. acos and their participants do not have sufficient data on all medicare ffs beneficiaries to know whether at the time and place of service the care furnished was the first primary care service that beneficiary received that year. furthermore, that beneficiary, while seeking care from the aco participant, might not be assigned to the aco in which the practitioner participates or might not reside in the market of that aco and could be reasonably confused and scared in response to the required language relating to claims data sharing with the aco. a cms template for the notification does not ease operational burden, as suggested by cms, and does not address the bigger concerns relating to beneficiary confusion and complaints.\n\n the next generation aco model currently requires that an annual written notification be mailed to aligned beneficiaries early in the performance year. it is unclear from the proposal whether cms conducted an analysis of 1-800-medicare call data as to whether the timing of that notification resulted in a higher volume of complaints. cms should conduct market testing and beneficiary focus groups to better understand how medicare ffs beneficiaries engage with their health care providers and understand their role in their care.\n\n to better support and strengthen beneficiary engagement, cms should instead consider permitting acos greater flexibility to communicate with patients about the program, such as including language on the aco websites as well as phone-recorded messages. current program rules restrict aco communication to beneficiaries and inhibit an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s ability to explain the benefits and services provided by acos. the aamc does not support the agency\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposal to require acos to provide written notification to all medicare ffs beneficiaries at the place of service.\n\n cms should not implement opt-in assignment methodology until the agency has a greater understanding of traditional medicare beneficiary consumer behavior\n cms proposes to allow acos to elect a new \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3beneficiary opt-in\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 enrollment-based assignment methodology that would be supplemented by a modified claims-based assignment and voluntary alignment. the opt-in assignment would be based on an affirmative recognition of the relationship between the beneficiary and the aco. the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3opt-in\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 approach would be supplemented with a modified claims-based assignment approach that focuses on the most complex patients by assigning beneficiaries to the aco with seven or more primary care service visits from aco clinicians.\n\n altering the attribution process to require beneficiaries to actively elect an aco would create insurmountable administrative complexities and would be confusing to beneficiaries. as noted in our comments on the proposed requirements for beneficiary notifications, medicare ffs beneficiaries are not engaged or generally aware of the services and benefits of acos. although cms introduced the voluntary alignment process to allow beneficiaries to designate a primary clinician via the mymedicare.gov website, the program remains underutilized. rather than add more complexity and confusion to beneficiary engagement with aco assignment, cms should instead focus on improvements to increase the use of the voluntary alignment option. this would serve as an incremental improvement to the broader challenges of educating medicare ffs beneficiaries about acos.\n\n the aamc opposes cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed introduction of an opt-in assignment methodology to the\n 15\n administrator verma october 16, 2018 page 16\n program at this time, and instead recommends that cms consider proposals to improve voluntary alignment before moving towards the development of an enrollment-based method.\n\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements\n skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver\n cms should finalize the proposal to expand use of snf 3-day rule waiver to all acos in two-sided risk regardless of beneficiary assignment methodology\n cms proposes, beginning july 1, 2019, to expand eligibility for the snf 3-day rule waiver to include acos participating in a two-sided model regardless of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s selected beneficiary assignment methodology. the aamc fully supports this proposal, as the snf 3-day rule waiver is a critical tool acos can use for coordinating and improving the quality of care. how a beneficiary is assigned to the aco should not limit the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s access to this tool.\n\n the aamc recommends that cms consider expanding use of the 3-day rule waiver for aco participants for all medicare ffs beneficiaries, in an effort to provide better care to all patients, and not only those that are attributed to the aco. this would streamline care coordination for all beneficiaries and greatly minimize burden associated with the current process.\n\n billing and payment for telehealth services\n the aamc supports the expansion of telehealth services for acos and urges cms to implement beginning july 1, 2019\n cms proposes to expand the use of telehealth services for acos. beginning with performance years 2020 and beyond, the agency would treat the beneficiary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s home as an originating site and not apply the originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services furnished by a physician or practitioner participating in an applicable aco. cms proposes to expand telehealth services only to acos under a two-sided risk arrangement that elect to participate under the prospective beneficiary assignment methodology. the telehealth expansion would not be available to an aco participating in two-side risk that elects to participate under the preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment methodology.\n\n the aamc supports the proposal to expand options for telehealth services for acos, as an additional tool that can support care coordination and beneficiary engagement with the aco. the aamc urges cms to implement the use of the telehealth services expansion sooner, beginning july 1, 2019, considering that the benefit enhancement is currently in use in the next generation aco model and could easily be adapted for use in the program.\n\n updating program policies\n policies on voluntary alignment\n cms should not include specialists in voluntary alignment\n cms proposes to modify current policies to assign a beneficiary to an aco based upon his or her selection of any aco professional, regardless of specialty, as his or her primary clinician. under this proposal, a beneficiary may select a practitioner with any specialty designation as his or her primary care provider and be eligible for voluntary alignment assignment to the aco in which the\n administrator verma october 16, 2018 page 17\n practitioner is an aco professional. currently the aco professional designated by the beneficiary must be a primary care physician as defined at \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 425.20, a physician with a specialty designation included at \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 425.402(c), or a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist. cms proposes to use a beneficiary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s designation to align the beneficiary to the aco in which his or her primary clinician participates even if the beneficiary does not receive primary care services from an aco professional in that aco.\n\n the aamc is concerned about the unintended consequences that may result due to the inclusion of specialists in the voluntary alignment process. if a beneficiary elects such a professional as his or her primary clinician, it could lead to the assignment of beneficiaries who do not actually receive their primary care from the aco. this could be especially problematic for faculty practices that participate in acos, as they are more likely to include specialists within the same billing tin, and thus could result in beneficiaries who only seek certain specialty services from the practice becoming more broadly assigned to the aco. the aamc recommends that at a minimum, if cms finalizes its proposal, the agency require that a beneficiary who elects a specialist as his/her primary clinician must have at least one qualified primary care service during the prior performance year with an aco professional as defined under step 1 or step 2 of claims-based assignment.\n\n definitions of primary care services used in beneficiary assignment\n cms should only incorporate additional codes for primary care services in step 1 of the assignment process\n cms proposes to revise the definition of primary care services to include the following healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) and current procedural terminology (cpt) codes: (1)\n advance care planning service codes, cpt codes 99497 and 99498; (2) administration of health risk assessment service codes, cpt codes 96160 and 96161; (3) prolonged evaluation and management or psychotherapy service(s) beyond the typical service time of the primary procedure, cpt codes 99354 and 99355; (4) annual depression screening service code, hcpcs code g0444; (5) alcohol misuse screening service code, hcpcs code g0442; and (6) alcohol misuse counseling service code, hcpcs code g0443.\n\n the aamc supports the proposal to modify the definition of primary care services to include the additional services enumerated above, but only if they are limited to step 1 of the claims- based assignment process. step | of claims-based assignment is focused on primary care services furnished by primary care physicians who are aco professionals, whereas step 2 considers primary care services furnished by aco professionals, including specialists. the proposed additional codes should be limited to use in for assigning beneficiaries on the basis of care furnished specifically by primary care physicians and not all aco professionals. furthermore, cms should continue to refine the primary care billing codes used in beneficiary assignment to ensure that those used are consistent with current billing practices.\n\n administrator

success mssp proposed rule\r\ndear administrator verma,\r\naugusta care partners is an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation

medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success\n dear administrator verma:\n on behalf of our 39 hospitals in arizona, california and nevada, dignity health appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) medicare shared savings program (mssp) pathways to success proposed rule. the fifth-largest hospital system in the nation, dignity health is proud of our commitment to our mission to provide quality, affordable care to all, especially the poor and disenfranchised.  dignity health believes humanity is the very core of health care and encourages cms to establish payment policies in a way that elevates the sacred covenant between providers and patients, to deliver the best care with the greatest compassion.\n in general, dignity health enthusiastic about the mssp as a way to advance ongoing efforts to transform care delivery through improved care coordination and financial accountability. while dignity health agrees certain provisions in the proposed rule will improve the stability and flexibility of the mssp and expand participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to provide care to beneficiaries, for example, via telehealth, we are also concerned other parts of the proposal will likely result in significant decrease in mssp participation. dignity health encourages cms to consider the possibility of such an outcome, and instead take an approach that will support broader provider participation to the mssp, using lessons learned from the current program.\n administrator page 2 october 16, 2018\n\n differentiations between physician- and hospital-led acos, does not empower acos to maximize their contribution to patient care and is not a pathway for improving the value of the mssp for beneficiaries. instead of making it harder for acos, particularly those with hospital participants, to achieve shared savings, we urge cms to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfloat all boats\u00e2\u0080\u009d by improving program methodology so it accurately rewards performance for improving quality and reducing costs.\n the aco model is a market-based solution to fragmented and costly care that empowers local physicians, hospitals and other providers to work together and take responsibility for improving quality, enhancing patient experience and reducing waste. importantly, the aco model also maintains patient choice of clinicians and other providers. acos have been instrumental in the transformation of health care delivery through meaningful clinical and operational changes that put patients first by improving their care and reducing unnecessary expenditures, shifting the paradigm to value-based care.\n supporting the movement to these value-based payment models goes beyond the quality and financial results of acos. from a market perspective, health care innovation happens through the creative power of healthcare providers seeking to transform the care delivery process. models in which payers seek to achieve savings and quality improvement will always fall short until healthcare providers themselves are held accountable for the results. remarkable innovations have been spurred by this accountability such as those in telehealth, hospital care in the home, special care centers, organizing community support organizations and systematically addressing the social determinates of health. for example, there are cases where we are able to take innovative approaches to manage chronic through the use of technology, but are strapped in our ability to reach the right patients, due to the constraints in the federal anti-kickback statute.  dignity health appreciates cms and the office of the inspector general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release of requests for information to update applicable laws and regulations to untie providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hands in leveraging technology to improve the quality of care.\n pathways to success establishes a step-wise approach for acos to increasingly take on more downside risk. while dignity health agrees that it is imperative that over time providers become increasingly responsible for total cost of care through risk-bearing agreements, cms must ensure providers have proper tools and experience to achieve this vision. with proper incentives and improvements in the program, organizations will take on risk, while improving the quality, clinical innovation and business benefit from doing so.\n\n dignity health\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to innovative payment models\n administrator page 3 october 16, 2018\n\n integrated care models by voluntarily entering into payment arrangements that include financial and performance accountability for episodes of care. in arizona, dignity health formed arizona care network (acn) in 2013 as a physician and health system collaboration designed to create a seamless approach to providing care to the community.  acn is a physician-led, physician-governed accountable care organization of over 5,000 clinicians and 16 hospitals across the phoenix metro area.  in collaboration with abrazo community health network (owned and operated by tenet healthcare) and phoenix children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care network, dignity health has participated in the track 1 mssp program since 2013 and began operating one of only forty-four medicare next generation acos in the united states in 2017.  today, acn covers more than 200,000 lives, including 32,000 medicare beneficiaries, under various value-based agreements with commercial, governmental and employer-sponsored health care payer partners.\n in addition, dignity health has three additional clinically integrated networks in california and nevada which also joined mssp track 1 in 2017. southern california integrated care network covers over 42,000 beneficiaries and includes all of the dignity health medical foundation providers. north state quality care network has over 8,000 beneficiaries across redding, ca. finally, st. rose quality care network has over 9,000 lives across greater las vegas.\n guiding principles\n dignity health supports a focus on voluntary models that reduce burdensome requirements and unnecessary regulations to allow providers to focus on providing high-quality, patient-centered care. as it moves forward in developing the path forward, dignity health urges cms to develop a framework that encourages collaboration and participation of all provider types.  to that end, dignity health urges cms use the guiding principles below as it moves to strengthen the path toward value-based care:\n guiding principle: elevate patients as partners in an aco.\n providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 participation in an aco program should provide real value to patients. too often, restrictive marketing and communication policies prevent acos from engaging and educating patients about the benefits of participation, much less letting them know they are part of an aco. cms should support a strategy to communicate with patients and create appropriate education and incentives to promote patient compliance to seek care within the aco. the ability to reach patients where they are is the first step to adopting a consumer-directed care delivery model.\n administrator page 4 october 16, 2018\n\n\n dignity health appreciates the goal to move more providers into down-side risk at a faster pace.  some providers will be ready, but most will not. while taking on financial risk is an important incentive for hospitals and clinicians to provide more efficient care, it must be a balanced with the operational changes that must take place over time. cms continues to underestimate the significant up-front investment required of providers that develop and implement alternative payment models (apms). in a state like california, with an incredibly complex health care marketplace that has some of the most onerous health care regulations in the country, it is a significant challenge to overcome. to develop the clinical and operational infrastructures necessary to better manage patient care, providers must invest substantial time, energy and resources. an analysis by the american hospital association estimated start-up costs of $11.6 million for a small accountable care organization and $26.1 million for a medium accountable care organization.\n guiding principle: support episode-based bundled payment models that recognize hospitals as the most appropriate initiator.\n several proposed changes in the rule make it harder for existing and new acos to participate in the program; a number of provisions significantly disadvantage and discourage participation in this program. for example, the proposed differentiation between high and low revenue acos make it particularly difficult for health system providers in california, including integrated health systems that are already struggling to find additional efficiencies in an already efficient system. cms should make significant revisions to improve the methodology to reward performance for improved quality and reduced costs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the fundamental principles of the program. in addition, cms should recognize hospitals are best equipped to lead other providers in moving toward downside risk; hospitals and health systems already have in place the necessary infrastructure to support operations, including health information technology, regulatory compliance and other administrative functions that are key to successful apm implementation.\n guiding principle:  advance the development of apm methodology that allow hospitals to build on experience with capitation under managed care.\n administrator page 5 october 16, 2018\n\n but are at a significant disadvantage in comparison to other areas of the country, including increasing the proposed three percent symmetrical cap on risk scores and application of the increased cap on a year-over-year basis rather than over the entire length of the agreement period.  we urge cms to not finalize the proposal to use the full twelve months of calendar year 2019 to determine the benchmark and assigned beneficiary expenditures for acos that participate in one or both of the 2019 six-month performance periods.\n guiding principle: support removal of legal and regulatory barriers to clinical integration, as well as modifications and waivers to medicare policies that deny hospitals the flexibility to provide the most efficient and clinically appropriate care.\n dignity health applauds the patient over paperwork initiative and the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s active solicitation of stakeholder feedback in changes needed to both the stark and anti-kickback laws through two separate requests for information. the agency should continue to find additional opportunities under the mssp program to remove unnecessary barriers in care delivery and in care transitions. both federal and california state law create serious barriers to clinical integration, which is essential to creating efficiencies and improving care under alternative payment models. clinical integration depends on hospitals, doctors, nurses and other caregivers working as a team to ensure that patients get the right care, at the right time, in the right place. shared savings and gainsharing provide important mechanisms for aligning providers' interests to decrease health care costs while improving quality, as the health care industry transitions from volume- to value-based payment.\n\n redesigning performance-based risk\n phase-in of performance-based risk in the basic track\n administrator page 6 october 16, 2018\n\n automatically advance at the start of each participation years along this glide path until they reach the track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maximum level of risk/reward (designed to be the same as the track 1+ model).\n dignity health supports an agreement period of at least 5 years, which will add stability to the program, but is significantly concerned the progression cms proposes to two-sided risk in the basic track is far too aggressive and will deter participation in the mssp. two years in a one-sided risk model is insufficient for acos to prepare for moving to downside risk. numerous studies show that acos require about 3-4 years to become successful.1 this is not surprising given that acos receive feedback on their performance several months into their first agreement period\u00e2\u0080\u0095any initiatives designed to improve performance always take more time than anticipated, and this is particularly true for the complex organizations and agreements that comprise an aco. organizations need time to make the structural, cultural, and practice changes required to successfully manage and assume financial risk for a population. in recognition of the time required for acos to be successful, cms should allow at least three years of no-downside risk within the basic track to ensure the success of participating acos and encourage future participation. cms should extend an optional fourth year in a one-sided track for acos that achieve savings, not necessarily shared savings, and have high quality.\n shared savings rate\n dignity health strongly urges cms to set the entry-level risk for the basic track at 50 percent with gradual increases in the shared-savings rate as acos progress through the various levels. lowering the shared-savings rate for acos with no downside risk from 50 percent to 25 percent provides little incentive for new acos to join the program. the low shared-savings rate also does not consider the substantial investment needed on the part of acos. according to an analysis by the aha, the investment required to put in place and sustain the elements necessary for a successful aco has been $11.6 to $26.1 million higher than previous estimates by cms. these costs, coupled with the cost of having a repayment mechanism in place to cover losses, creates a high hurdle for organizations who are transitioning to accountable care.\n the proposed shared savings rate is a significant decrease for existing acos, which will be unable to reinvest savings back into population management and care coordination. shared savings payments are critical as part of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transformation toward value-based care and are necessary to incentivize providers to make the infrastructure investments needed to transform care delivery and processes. without them, acos will struggle to provide care and services needed\n administrator page 7 october 16, 2018\n\n to appropriately manage the health of the population and move more rapidly to risk, undermining the overall goal of the program. reducing shared savings also produces problems with provider participation and aco buy-in, as some organizations already find this difficult at current shared savings level. to incentivize acos to take on risk, cms should increase the shared-savings rates as acos take on additional risk. we recommend increasing the shared savings by 5 percent with each step: levels a/b: 50 percent; levels c/d: 55 percent; and level e: 60 percent.\n calculation of loss sharing limit\n dignity health supports using the lower of the revenue-based or historical benchmark for calculation of the loss sharing limit, but recommends cms align the risk level for track e with the nominal risk threshold for apm models established under the qpp, which is 3 percent of the historical benchmark, rather than the 4 percent cms proposes. cms provides no rationale for setting the benchmark-based loss limit at the nominal risk standard plus one percentage point. the purpose of track e is to provide aco entities with a more gradual pathway to risk, while also meeting the requirements of an aapm. setting the historical-benchmark at a higher level would disproportionately affect acos with hospital participants and subject them to additional risk as they will always use the historical-based benchmark since medicare part a and b revenue will far exceed the historic-based benchmark. accordingly, increasing the benchmark-based loss limit creates an unlevel playing field for acos that include hospital participants this proposed policy is counter to the goal of acos to encourage providers to work together to improve care for beneficiaries and discourages both health-system led and physician-led acos from recruiting hospital participants.\n cms should allow all acos to remain in track e or whatever track meets the nominal risk requirements under qpp. if cms increases the qpp aapm nominal risk threshold, cms should create a glidepath in mssp for acos to transition to the new standard of risk.\n transition from level e to enhanced track\n administrator page 8 october 16, 2018\n\n program) and increase the maximum shared savings and losses rate over the agreement period.\n\n permitting annual participation elections\n annual risk election\n cms proposes to allow acos in the basic track to more rapidly transition (i.e., skip a level or levels) during the agreement period, but level e must be entered into no later than the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth performance year under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal. dignity health encourages cms to provide acos with more flexibility in their annual participation elections. if an aco selects a higher level of risk than it would have been automatically assigned, it should not be required to automatically advance the following year (i.e. an aco is not required to advance beyond the track they would have been assigned if they did not choose to advance to a higher track). as noted earlier, acos require additional time moving to risk. this option would provide acos the option to gain experience in a limited risk track for more than one year. additionally, we ask that cms consider allowing high performing acos more than one year in limited risk tracks (i.e. level c and d); cms could set parameters for successful acos to continue in a particular track prior to automatic advancing (i.e. achieving savings, not necessarily shared savings, and high quality).\n annual election of beneficiary assignment\n in alignment with the bipartisan budget act of 2018, cms proposes to allow all acos with a choice of prospective assignment for the agreement periods beginning july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years. as proposed, acos would also be able to change its beneficiary assignment methodology through the annual election process.  dignity health strongly supports this change that would allow acos the option of choosing prospective beneficiary assignment or prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation. this would provide acos with flexibility to better manage their patient populations based on their unique circumstances certain acos, such as a small aco that is worried about dropping below the 5,000-beneficiary threshold, may favor a model where the aco can add beneficiaries throughout the year, and would thus prefer the retrospective assignment model. other acos would likely prefer a prospective model, which would help them stabilize their beneficiary population. the prospective approach also allows more advanced acos to employ data analysis and beneficiary engagement techniques from the start of the performance period on a population for whom they know they are responsible.\n determining participation based on revenue and prior participation\n administrator page 9 october 16, 2018\n\n cms proposes to define participation options by making a distinction between low revenue acos and high revenue acos. high revenue acos are a proxy for acos that typically include a hospital billing through an aco participant tin; cms defines this as an aco whose total part a and b revenue for aco participants is greater than the total parts a and b expenditures for aco assigned beneficiaries. acos falling below this threshold are considered low-revenue acos, a proxy for physician group acos. cms believes that high revenue acos are more capable of accepting higher risk than low revenue acos. cms provides fewer participation options for high revenue acos. high revenue acos with \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d can only participate in the enhanced track regardless of whether they are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cre-entering\u00e2\u0080\u009d the program. in addition, low revenue (and inexperienced) acos may operate under the basic track for a maximum of two agreement periods, whereas high revenue acos are limited to one agreement period. dignity health opposes this proposal and urges cms to eliminate the low/high revenue distinction for determining participation options; all acos should the treated the same.\n defining participation options by \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cms also proposes to limit participations options by categorizing acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d with performance-based risk medicare aco initiatives and determining participation options based on prior participation of aco legal entity and aco participants. cms defines a \u00e2\u0080\u009cre-entering aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d as (1) the same legal entity as an aco, identified by tin, or a (2) new legal entity that has never participated in the mssp and is applying to participate in the program and more than 50 percent of its aco participants were included on the aco participant list. cms defines an experienced aco that meets either of the following criteria: (1) the aco is the same legal entity as a current or previous aco that is participating in, or has participated in, a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under track 2 or track 3; or (2) 40 percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or in an aco that deferred its entry into a mssp agreement period under track 2 or track 3, in any of the 5 most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n administrator page 10 october 16, 2018\n\n to avoid gaming of the options for the glidepath not to discourage new entities. to balance this potential outcome, cms should also consider a second criteria, setting a threshold for a percentage of participants that previously were in the same entity. for example, cms would first identify if 50 percent of participants would qualify aco to be reentering or experienced; then if less than 30 percent of participants were part of the same legal entity then the aco could appeal the label of reentering or experienced.\n monitoring for financial performance\n cms proposes additional provisions to address an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial performance when an aco may otherwise be in compliance with program requirements. cms states that just as poor quality performance can subject an aco to remedial action or termination, an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to lower growth in medicare ffs expenditures should be the basis for cms to take pre-termination actions. these actions could include a request for corrective action by the aco, or termination of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement. specifically, cms proposes to terminate acos if it is negative outside corridor for two agreement periods. cms appears to be particularly concerned about one-sided risk acos that continue to participate in the program and generate net losses to medicare.\n dignity health opposes the cms proposal to terminate acos if negative outside corridor for two agreement periods. these additional provisions, if implemented, would provide cms with too much discretion to terminate aco participation in the program. such unchecked authority would further discourage aco participation in the mssp, because this would create additional uncertainty for participants and would make it difficult to establish agreements with other organizations. moreover, cms proposals with respect to the glide path that would limit participation in one-sided risk models would also provide acos with incentives to leave the program if they were not able to generate savings.\n election of minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss rate (mlr) by acos\n cms proposes that acos under the basic track would have the same msr/mlr options that are currently available to acos under one-sided and two- side models of the mssp. acos under the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path in level a or level b would choose the msr/mlr to be applied before the start of their first performance year in a two-sided model. cms also proposes to use a variable msr/mlr when performing shared savings and shared losses if an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population falls below 5,000 for the performance year, regardless of whether the aco selected a fixed or variable msr/mlr. dignity health supports these proposals and appreciates the flexibility these options provide to meet acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs.\n administrator page 11 october 16, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n benchmarking methodology refinements\n risk adjustment methodology\n dignity health appreciates the refinements cms proposes that would eliminate the distinction of newly and continuously aligned beneficiaries for purposes of risk adjustment. this appropriately recognizes that risk scores should increase or decrease during the course of the agreement period and that the beneficiary population underlying health changes with time. at the same time, dignity health believes the +/- 3 percent cap is too restrictive and urges cms to raise it to +/- 5 percent, which  would more accurately account for changes in risk over a performance period. ideally, cms should provide additional incentives for acos to move to higher risk levels by providing additional flexibility in accounting for the risk of the population. this could be accomplished by allowing the cap to increase as acos take on additional risk. level e in the basic track, for example, would have a higher cap than levels c and d. in addition, the cap for the enhanced track should align with the percentage change in risk scores for ma plans.\n use of regional factors when establishing and resetting aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmarks\n cms proposes to incorporate regional expenditures into the benchmarking methodology for acos in a first agreement period for all acos entering the program beginning on july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years. under current policy, the maximum weight applied to the regional adjustment is 70 percent. cms proposes policies that would limit the magnitude of the adjustment by reducing the weight (to a maximum of 50 percent) and imposing an absolute dollar limit on the adjustment (capped at 5 percent of the national per capita expenditures for parts a and b services in baseline year 3 for assignable beneficiaries).\n dignity health supports the proposal to incorporate the regional adjustment into the initial agreement period, but does not support lowering the regional contribution to below 50 percent. dignity health urges cms to maintain the current maximum contribution of 70 percent.  dignity health recommends the following schedule of weights to be applied:\n administrator page 12 october 16, 2018\n\n schedule of weights for regional adjustment timing when subject to regional adjustment aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical spending is lower than its region aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical spending is higher than its region first time 30% 25% second time 50% 35% third  70% 50% all subsequent periods 70% 70%\n dignity health also supports the proposal to cap regional adjustment at 5 percent of national expenditures to control for outliers. cms should, however, provide additional flexibility to incentivize acos to take on more risk and provide an option for acos to use national benchmarks (in lieu of regional) for risk-bearing acos. this would be more desirable for acos in historically low spend regions that believe their targets are too low to take on downside risk.\n\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements\n skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver expansion\n currently, the snf 3-day rule waiver can be requested only by those mssp acos that bear performance-based risk and to whom beneficiaries are prospectively assigned.  cms proposes to expand the waiver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s applicability beginning july 1, 2019, to include performance-risk bearing acos that utilize preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment.  in all cases, the snf must be an eligible affiliate of the aco and, in most cases, have a rating of 3 stars or better in the cms five-star snf quality rating system.  (cms also is proposing to allow swing bed operators, who are not included in the star rating system, to become eligible snf affiliates.)  the waiver is available currently to track 3 and track 1+ acos; the proposed expansion would include track 2, basic track levels c, d, and e and the enhanced track.  dignity health strongly supports the proposed expansion of snf 3-day rule waiver applicability as another important tool with which acos can more effectively coordinate care while increasing quality and reducing unnecessary costs.\n\n telehealth waiver expansion\n administrator page 13 october 16, 2018\n\n inpatient-only. the expanded telehealth policy would apply to track 3 and to track 1+ acos as well as to those on the newly proposed enhanced track and on levels c, d, and e of the basic track.  dignity health strongly supports the telehealth expansion as proposed, particularly when combined with the increased flexibility that would occur with the proposed ability for acos to annually elect either prospective or preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment.\n tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n beneficiary incentive program implementation\n beneficiaries assigned to mssp acos, regardless of assignment methodology, retain their rights to seek care outside of the aco without penalty.  therefore, to effectively deliver value-based care, acos must seek to actively engage the beneficiaries for whom they will be held accountable for quality and cost, yet mssp acos are prohibited from marketing activities, such as those permitted for medicare advantage (ma) plans.  current regulations do allow acos to provide in-kind items or services as incentives, the propriety of which are judged on a case-by-case basis, but acos are inhibited by the simultaneously applicable statutes (e.g., anti-kickback and cmp provisions).  the bba 2018 enables performance-based risk-bearing acos to establish incentive payment programs to encourage their assigned beneficiaries to obtain medically necessary primary care services, beginning no later than january 1, 2020.  cms proposes implementing regulations, including aco eligibility and incentive program application and certification processes, with a start date of july 1, 2019 (coinciding with the first agreement period of the redesigned aco tracks).  cms also addresses beneficiary eligibility, primary care services that would qualify for incentive payments, and incentive program recordkeeping, along with payment amount, timing, and distribution method.\n dignity health appreciates that the regulations proposed by cms to implement the beneficiary incentive payment program as directed by bba 2018 are not overly restrictive and are attentive to minimizing provider and beneficiary burden. given longstanding concerns about compliance of aco incentive programs with applicable fraud and abuse laws, dignity health asks cms to provide template language for acos to notify beneficiaries about their new incentive programs.  finally, since establishing a primary care incentive payment program is optional for acos, dignity health recommends cms make available summary information about the uptake of beneficiary incentive programs when reporting overall mssp results.  information from early adopters of incentive programs would be valuable to the remaining acos when making their decisions about applying to establish incentive programs.\n administrator page 14 october 16, 2018\n\n\n cms requires mssp acos notify beneficiaries that their care is being furnished under a shared savings payment model and that they may opt out of having identifiable, claims-level data about themselves shared with their acos. cms has modified the content, frequency and delivery mechanisms for beneficiary notification multiple times since the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inception. currently, notices must be posted in acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 primary care delivery sites and a written beneficiary information notice must be provided upon beneficiary request.  cms proposes to expand the requirements beginning july 1, 2019, creating a cms template notice, designed to be a comprehensive single source of mssp information that must be given to beneficiaries during their first primary care visit of each performance year.  cms further proposes to add material to the revised notice informing beneficiaries of their option to voluntarily designate an aco professional to coordinate their care (i.e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary clinician\u00e2\u0080\u009d or\u00e2\u0080\u009d main doctor\u00e2\u0080\u009d), thereby implementing the voluntary alignment provisions of bba 2018.\n administrator page 15 october 16, 2018\n\n\n dignity health recommends no changes be made to the current notification processes regarding the shared savings payment model, aco participation by a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practitioners, and opting out of beneficiary identifiable, claims-level data-sharing.  dignity health also recommends notifications about voluntary alignment be presented separately, in keeping with the bba 2018 provisions designed to support access to this choice by beneficiaries and the potential of this option to directly increase beneficiary engagement. dignity health further recommends mssp aco beneficiary user groups be created and that no new or revised notifications be implemented without input from those groups; their input should also guide delivery method choices made available to beneficiaries for various notifications.\n opt-in assignment methodology\n cms discusses at length and invites comments about all aspects of a hybrid assignment methodology that would include direct aco opt in (a beneficiary chooses assignment to a specific aco); voluntary alignment with an aco professional (with resulting assignment to the aco in which that professional participates); and a modification of the current claims-based assignment methodology (incorporating a minimum level of primary care visits furnished to a beneficiary).  cms does not make any formal proposal about the hybrid methodology nor indicate a timeline for further consideration of its implementation.\n administrator page 16 october 16, 2018\n\n\n\n updating program policies\n voluntary alignment policy revisions\n medicare ffs beneficiaries may choose to designate an aco professional as their primary clinician for coordinating their care, and the beneficiary who does so becomes voluntarily aligned to the designated professional\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aco.  currently, a primary clinician must be either a primary care practitioner or practice one of a limited list of specialties (e.g., cardiology), and the beneficiary must have received at least one primary care service from a professional who practices primary care or a listed specialty in the aligned aco.  as part of bba 2018 implementation, cms proposes policy revisions to begin with performance year 2019 including removing the specialty restrictions to primary clinician eligibility and no longer requiring the voluntarily aligned beneficiary to have received any services from a professional in the aligned aco during the applicable beneficiary assignment window.  dignity health supports the removal of specialty restrictions for primary clinicians but recommends retention of the requirement for a beneficiary to receive at least one primary care service from an aco participant\n revised definitions of primary care for use in beneficiary assignment\n in accordance with provisions of the 21st century cures act and bba 2018, for performance years 2019 and thereafter cms proposes to update the definition of primary care services that is used when assigning beneficiaries to acos (in combination with the applicable mssp track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assignment methodology). services that would satisfy the revised definition include some existing current procedural terminology (cpt) codes (e.g., advance care planning) and healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) g-codes (e.g., depression screening) along with new g-codes proposed elsewhere in the rule\n(e.g., complexity inherent in office visits for certain specialties). cms also \n proposes to more accurately distinguish short-term, rehabilitation-related evaluation and management services provided in nursing facilities from ongoing primary care services furnished to longer-term nursing facility residents.  cms would identify the former services by linking the appropriate cpt codes to nursing facility claims for the same dates of service rather than relying on the place of service code for snfs (code 31) as listed on the professional claim. dignity health supports the changes as proposed and agrees with cms that linking snf facility claims by date of service to professional claims will better identify short-term, rehabilitation-focused care that should not be counted as primary care services that contribute to beneficiary assignment to acos.\n administrator page 17 october 16, 2018\n\n extreme and uncontrollable circumstances\n in december, 2017, cms issued an interim final rule with comment period that established policies to address quality performance scoring and shared loss determinations for mssp acos impacted by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances occurring in performance year 2017 (e.g., hurricanes and widespread wildfires).  cms proposes some limited changes to update the existing policies for use in performance year 2018 and subsequent years, including revisions to align the performance scoring and shared loss determination processes with the proposed redesigned aco tracks.  dignity health supports continuation of the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policies as applied in 2017 with the proposed revisions.\n program data and quality measures\n dignity health agrees that the existing aco quality measure set appropriately emphasizes outcomes over process.  dignity health also supports the goals of the meaningful measures initiative in general as well as the streamlined aco measure set for 2019 as proposed in the medicare physician fee schedule proposed rule.  dignity health recommends cms seek input from the measures application partnership to enhance the aco measure set by identifying measures that best reflect the focus of alternative payment models such as acos on care coordination and population health and that cms commit funding to development of such measures.\n cms states that the medicare program has become the largest payer for prescription opioids in the united states.  as a result, medicare drug event records now constitute a substantial and critically important repository of substance use disorder data.  cms currently provides part d prescription drug event data to each aco on a monthly basis, but items potentially related to substance use disorders are routinely de-identified, provided only in aggregate, or both.  acos are held accountable for the total health of their beneficiary populations, but the ability of acos to most effectively manage population health is being increasingly constrained by the limited and non-specific substance disorder data with which they are provided.  many beneficiaries are taking multiple medications and are at high risk for adverse drug interactions when opioids are prescribed for them. if cms holds acos accountable for measures of substance use disorder management, it should provide acos with access to the data necessary for instituting appropriate treatment (i.e., complete and identifiable data for all prescribed medications and their related diagnoses).\n administrator page 18 october 16, 2018\n\n who are already subject to hipaa patient privacy protection regulations.  until part 2 reform is enacted, dignity health strongly recommends providers who are engaged in population health management (e.g. acos) and that are bound by a data use agreement with cms, receive complete and identifiable data from cms about substance use disorder--related diagnoses and services furnished to their assigned beneficiaries by providers to whom part 2 does not apply.\n cms further states that over one-third of beneficiaries assigned to mssp acos with continuous part d coverage have at least one opioid prescription but that rates vary substantially across acos (10-60%).  such variability strongly suggests opportunities to improve the quality of care for substance use disorders in many acos.  assuming cms makes the necessary beneficiary medication data available, dignity health supports consideration by cms of adding opioid use measures to the mssp measure set, but does not support the addition of measures that focus primarily on opioid dosing (e.g., nqf #2951 use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer).  dignity health is concerned that rigid adherence to dosing guidelines (e.g., the centers for disease control & prevention guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain) may cause serious adverse outcomes (e.g., depression, suicide) for patients being successfully managed on long-term opioid analgesics whose dosing regimens are abruptly changed to achieve guideline compliance.\n promoting interoperability (pi)\n administrator page 19 october 16, 2018\n\n cehrt usage.  the pi category weight for such clinicians would then be redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories.\n pharmacy care coordination: request for comments\n dignity health supports exploration by cms of approaches that could facilitate collaboration between acos and part d stand-alone prescription drug plan sponsors and lead to improved outcomes, such as more widespread use of medication therapy management. cms should investigate ways to make complete pharmacy data more readily available to mssp acos and their clinicians. particular attention should be given to enabling technology methods\n(e.g., secure data access portals, data sets accessible using application \n programming interfaces) that could provide acos with real-time access to claims data (prior to or synchronous with claims processing) for their aligned beneficiaries. real-time access would allow acos to build provider alert processes that would improve care by triggering rapid clinical interventions when needed, as is being done already by some ma and commercial plans.\n cms should develop one or more voluntary mssp demonstrations that incorporate aco accountability for part d costs. doing so would allow those acos who are ready and interested to participate, would accelerate progress towards readiness by the remaining acos, and would provide a platform for testing multiple approaches, the most effective of which could be expanded to all acos. maximizing flexibility should guide the design of such demonstrations; for example, allowing acos to select patient cohorts for whom to be responsible\n(e.g., high-risk patients with diabetes or patients with multiple chronic \n conditions).\n\n conclusion\n dignity health is committed success of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 alternative payment models and encourage cms to consider models beyond acos. specifically, we recommend cms consider adopting a \u00e2\u0080\u009clayered payment model\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a provider-driven aco model that includes primary care capitation as well as inpatient and outpatient bundles within a global capitated amount along with legal waivers that will allow providers to employ tools similar to ma plans.\n thank you again for the opportunity to respond to submit comments on this proposed rule. please feel free to reach out to clara evans,

health care company in the u.s. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 owns and operates 34 community hospitals across nine states, serves over 1,000 distinct communities and employs approximately 40,000 health care professionals. in addition to our hospitals, the steward provider network includes 4,800 providers, 25 urgent care centers, 87 preferred skilled nursing facilities, substantial behavioral health offerings, over 7,300 hospital beds under management, and approximately 1.5 million full risk covered lives through the company's managed care and health insurance services. steward's integrated care network projects reaching three million risk members in 2019, inclusive of nearly 200,000 medicare beneficiaries in a medicare accountable care organization (aco) model. we appreciate the opportunity to respond to the proposed changes to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) medicare shared savings program (mssp). since joining the pioneer aco demonstration model in 2011 as one of the first in the nation, steward has shared in cms' commitment to advance innovative reimbursement and care delivery models. through participation in models such as the pioneer aco and next generation aco (ngaco), steward has delivered coordinated, high quality, cost-efficient health care services to medicare beneficiaries. steward strongly supports cms' proposed new direction which would encourage a faster transition to two-sided risk models. steward has long advocated for models of care that include both upside and downside risk. in particular, we support the following changes as outlined in the proposed rule:\na. \u0000 increasing levels of up- and downside risk over a five-year contract period. \n\nb. additional beneficiary alignment and engagement tools previously unavailable to mssp \n acos.\nc. hcc risk adjustment methodology similar to what is currently in place for the ngaco \n program, although further modernization is necessary (see \"accurate risk adjustmene). in addition to the proposed changes, we offer cms the following recommendations, borne out of our extensive experience in aco programs across all payers: prospective global capitation model we strongly believe that the addition of a prospective, global capitation model to the cms aco portfolio would build on the work and progress of the current aco models and help providers better coordinate patient care and improve health outcomes. physicians currently participating in acos (e.g. mssp or ngaco) bill cms for services under fee-for-service and undergo a performance reconciliation at the end of the year. this model, however, suffers from a unique case of a mal-alignment phenomenon: a single physician (pcp or specialist) can frequently earn higher marginal returns, by charging for volume rather than relying on the aco returns (i.e. value); \"hurtine the performance of all, since he/she accrues all benefits but shares the burden with the network. for example, physicians may recommend an unnecessary exam if the benefit accruing to themselves is greater than the loss accruing to themselves via the\naco. this is value-based care on a volume-based chassis and does not lead to sustainable change. \n prospective global capitation payments overcome this mal-alignment phenomenon. in addition, prospective global capitation payments allow providers to fund and incorporate population health programs that holistically address patient needs across the care continuum, while reducing total cost of care and improving quality. when providers are paid under a prospective globally capitated payment system, they can overcome budgetary timing issues to fund activities that are typically excluded from the traditional fee-for-service system, such as:\na. system infrastructure, including development of health information technology to improve \n access to care and care coordination,\nb. social determinants of health and patient connections to community organizations, \n\nc. wellness and prevention programs, and \n\nd. behavioral health integration. \n we urge cmmi to add a prospective, globally capitated payment model to the medicare aco portfolio that includes:\na. prospective, capitated payments directly from cms. \n\nb. accountability for high quality, efficient care under medicare part a and medicare part b, \n at a minimum.\nc. upside and downside risk associated with managing a medicare population's total cost of \n care, not just sharing in the savings.\nd. proactive beneficiary enrollment as an option, combined with the prospective attribution \n model currently

organizations-pathways to success\u00e2\u0080\u009d 83 fed. reg. 41786 (august 17, 2018)\n dear administrator verma,\n christus health (christus) appreciates the opportunity to submit the following comments to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) regarding the medicare shared savings program (mssp) accountable care organizations (acos) proposed rule, published in the federal register on august 17, 2018.  christus is an integrated, not-for-profit international health system that includes nearly 350 services and facilities, including more than 50 hospitals in seven u.s. states.  we share the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong commitment to promoting health and wellness solutions that improve the lives of the individuals and communities we serve.\n we appreciate the ongoing efforts by cms to administer and improve the shared savings program, and we support the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal of better alignment between incentives and high- value care delivery.  the christus health quality care alliance (chqca) has actively participated in the shared savings program since 2016 as a track 1 model.  our aco has 1,000 participating primary care physicians in louisiana, texas, arkansas and new mexico and 76,475 beneficiaries attributed to the program.\n as a \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh-revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d aco, we are concerned about the accelerated path for acos to assume financial risk and the potential negative impact this would have on the medicare beneficiaries our physicians treat. christus is a leading provider of uncompensated care among not-for- profit health care systems and operates in states with some of the highest rates of uninsured, including the states noted above.  these proposed policies may have a significant impact on whether christus will be able to provide the same level of charity care to our indigent patients and surrounding communities going forward.\n 2\n specifically, cms proposes to discontinue track 1 (and track 2) and develop a fast-track pathway for mssp acos to take on financial risk by limiting the time in a one-sided risk model from the current six years to two years. as a current track 1 participant, chqca would actually be restricted to one year under a one-sided model.  cms also proposes to cut the shared savings rate in half for one-sided risk acos (from 50 percent to 25 percent).  these policies require providers to take on a much higher financial risk, with unpredictable outcomes.  christus is concerned that the impact of increased financial pressure will cause acos to inappropriately focus on reducing costs over achieving high-quality outcomes, and consequently put beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 access to medical care at-risk.\n as previously stated, chqca falls into the category of \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh-revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos with a geographic presence across four states.  chqca has focused on developing a strong aco foundation by creating trustworthy relationships and operational alignment with independent physicians with little near-term financial value.  we have also successfully dedicated our initial establishment as an aco on quality and patient experience by prioritizing patient well-being, health outcomes, and quality of life. at this point, chqca is now prepared to make an impact on \u00e2\u0080\u009cbending the cost curve,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but in order to make an impact on cost, the financial investment will become much steeper, and funds have not yet been committed to make significant investments in administration and care delivery.\n based on recent analysis, fewer \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh-revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos are ultimately successful.  we believe this is due to misaligned payment incentives that structurally prohibit change.  for example, lack of interoperability and connectivity is an ongoing challenge requiring significant investment of time, money and resources. we expect it will take another 12 to 24 months to become almost fully interoperable and provide actionable results.\n therefore, we would urge cms to reconsider its proposal to remove risk earlier in an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development.  based on chqca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience, an additional three years as a one-sided aco would allow for a more comfortable transition to significantly impact cost without considerable financial risk.  even if successful, the investment may not produce savings until at least eighteen months after the first day of a performance year, as christus had planned before cms proposed to reform the shared savings program.\n on behalf of christus health, thank you again for the opportunity to provide feedback on this proposed rule. we are hopeful that our comments are helpful, and we welcome any questions you may have.\n\n\n 3\n\n sincerely,\n\n\n john a. gillean, m.d. executive vice president & chief clinical officer (469) 282-2540

administrator verma,\n thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed rule, accountable care organizations (aco) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success, which includes the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) efforts to accelerate two-sided, performance-based risk models; the expansion of telehealth as an effective and enabling tool in these models; and the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in increasing beneficiary engagement in aco selection.\n the gary and mary west health institute (whi) is a national applied medical research organization dedicated to generating the evidence required for healthcare providers, policymakers and communities to develop and adopt models of care that better serve seniors and their families. we believe healthcare costs in this country are unsustainable, and to lower costs while improving quality, it is essential to move away from our current volume-based, fee-for-service (ffs) system to one focused on delivering value-based care with two-sided, performance-based risk. we have made increasing access to value-based care models a core tenant of our research efforts.\n accelerated timeline for acos to transition into two-sided risk models\n the proposed rule accelerates the timeline for acos to move into two-sided, performance- based risk models. we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to speed up this transition, particularly given the evidence that two-sided risk models have saved more, on average, than one-sided risk models, as reported by the medicare payment advisory commission in its june 2018 report. we understand acos need time and resource investments to operate effectively but believe accelerating the timeline for transition to two-sided risk models encourages them to more quickly align their models of care to focus on improving quality and lowering spending. two- sided, performance-based risk models also create a stronger alignment of financial incentives between stakeholders.\n we acknowledge that a rapid transition to two-sided risk models may cause some acos to exit the program or prevent new ones from joining. however, cms has likely moderated these concerns by incorporating other policy changes and flexibilities in the proposed rule, such as refining the benchmarking methodology, allowing for risk adjustment each performance year, adjusting patient attribution methodology, and establishing flexibility for low-revenue acos.\n page 2 of 2 -- west health institute comments on the proposed rule, cms-1701-p\n west health institute  10350

telehealth waivers in next generation acos and acos in track 2, track 3, and other two-sided, performance-based risk models. policies in the proposed rule fulfill these provisions by allowing use of telehealth waivers in two-sided risk acos that use prospective beneficiary assignment.\n through our research, we have demonstrated that telehealth is an efficient and effective tool for improving patient access to care in value-based care models. telehealth allows care to be delivered to patients in their homes\u00e2\u0080\u0094often a more appropriate setting than hospitals or other inpatient facilities for seriously ill individuals. acos with two-sided risk have aligned incentives to maximize the benefits of telehealth and use it efficiently to provide essential care and improved quality, while decreasing costs.\n beneficiary voluntary alignment with acos\n the proposed rule also puts forth regulations to implement the voluntary alignment provisions included in the bba. although we support this attribution method as a potential means for increasing beneficiary engagement in value-based care, we encourage cms to adopt consumer protections during this process. specifically, cms should implement safeguards to prevent acos from encouraging or dissuading a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s selection of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary clinician\u00e2\u0080\u009d based on the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk profile. additionally, as beneficiaries actively select their primary clinician, cms should inform them\u00e2\u0080\u0094in an easy-to-understand and accessible manner\u00e2\u0080\u0094that medicare allows them to seek care from any participating clinician, inside or outside an aco.\n thank you for the opportunity to provide our perspectives on the proposed rule. whi strongly encourages cms to move towards adoption of these promising two-sided risk models and fully supports the expansion of telehealth services as part of the movement to value-based payment. additionally, we are encouraged by action to increase beneficiary engagement in acos, but caution that cms will need to implement safeguards to ensure beneficiaries are aware their coverage allows them to see any medicare-participating clinician.\n if you have any questions regarding these comments or wish to discuss these matters in more detail, please contact me at 858-412-8677 or

organizations-pathways to success; proposed rule\n dear ms. verma:\n the  healthcare  association  of  new  york  state  (hanys),  on  behalf  of  our member nonprofit and public hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies and other healthcare providers, welcomes the opportunity to comment on the medicare shared savings program (mssp) proposed rule.\n hanys supports the efforts of mssp to help providers move toward valued-based care, improve care coordination, and reduce costs.  however, drastically shortening the  length  of  time  in  which  an  accountable  care  organization  (aco)  can participate in an upside-only model as proposed in this rule, would make it harder for these organizations to succeed under these programs going forward. in making this proposal, cms has overlooked important factors, such as acos starting with varying levels of education and experience with the complexities of value-based care  under  mssp.    taking  on  financial  risk  prematurely  can  cause  a  hardship because organizations need time to gain working knowledge of the program and coordinate the contractual relationships that need to be in place to succeed under mssp.\n hanys  strongly  recommends  that  cms  allow  more  time  before  acos participate  in  risk-bearing  models.  cms  should  establish  policies  that encourage, not discourage participation.\n reorganize tracks cms is proposing to reorganize participation options for acos by combining the current tracks 1, 1+, and 2 into the newly proposed basic track and renaming track 3 the enhanced track.  under the basic track, eligible acos would start under an upside-only model for one to two years and incrementally phase in higher levels of risk through  a  glide path, while under the enhanced track acos would have more flexibility and would take on higher levels of risk. 2018 board of trustees board officers steven corwin, md \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 new york chair richard murphy \u00e2\u0080\u00a2

         page 2 october 16, 2018\n\n these  changes  would  curtail  an  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  ability  to  participate  under  mssp;  therefore, hanys supports the association of american medical colleges (aamc) recommendation that cms allow basic track participants at least four years under the upside-only model for acos to meet certain cost and quality requirements before transitioning to downside risk. furthermore,  those  acos  that  perform  well  on  quality  and  have  contained  cost  growth should be allowed the full five years with no downside risk.\n currently, under track 1, acos can apply for waivers from some federal requirements to test innovative cost control measures and may operate for up to six years without taking on any risk of losses. acos would earn shared savings payment from cms when they keep costs down, but they do not have to pay the difference when costs are higher than co ntracted  payment  amounts. according to a survey done by the national association of acos, 71% of current track 1 acos are likely to leave the proposed mssp if cms adopts its policy to require all acos to assume risk after two years. with the current track 1 representing 82% of mssp acos in 2018, hanys does not believe forcing acos to prematurely assume risk under its proposed model is the right path  when  these  programs  are  ultimately  voluntary.  cms  should  instead  offer  a  more gradual pathway to risk-bearing models.\n cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to offer only one year of performance before transitioning to downside risk does not  allow  enough  time  for  acos  to  take  the  proper  steps  to  ensure  improved  performance  to succeed under this program in future years. if acos withdraw from mssp, they could return to payment models that emphasize volume over value-based payments, creating a major setback for medicare payment reform at a time when the agency is moving toward value of care, rather than volume of care given.  hanys encourages cms to develop mssp policies that would balance the goals of transitioning providers to value-based payment  models that are risk-bearing while also retaining participation of those willing to work on value-based models without risk.\n shared savings earned under mssp, currently acos can earn a shared savings rate of 50% under track 1 and up to 75% under track 3.  cms is proposing to cut the level of shared savings earned.  if adopted, for levels a and  b the shared savings  earned would be significantly  reduced, from 50% to 25%,  with a gradual increase up to 50% once the aco reaches level e, which is the same shared savings as track 1+.  a 25% reduction is substantial and could stop the growth of the program across the country.\n cms  needs  to  recognize  that  acos  incur  significant  costs  under mssp  for  clinical  and  care management, health information technology, population analytics, and redesign of care processes. as  a  result,  acos  will  lose  money  if  they  do  not  earn  enough  shared savings to offset the significant costs to participate. for these reasons, hanys supports aamc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opposition to such a steep reduction in what acos can receive through the shared savings earned. we urge cms to maintain a 50% shared rate for levels a and b of the basic track and increase to 55% for levels c and d and 60% for level e to recognize the level of downside risk at each level.\n seema verma                                                                         page 3 october 16, 2018\n\n\n eligibility requirements cms is proposing to base an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue and prior medicare aco experience (with a five- year  look  back  period)  to  determine  what  level  an  aco  is  required to enter into the basic or enhanced tracks.  cms considers an aco \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d if its medicare part a and b fee-for- service  revenue  is  at  least  25%  of  the  medicare  part  a  and  b  expenditures  for  assigned beneficiaries. \u00e2\u0080\u009cless revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d would be defined as less than 25%.\n cms based its proposal to differentiate between low and high revenue acos on misguided data that suggest \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos do better than \u00e2\u0080\u009chospital-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos.  however, the agency provided no citations or transparency as to the source of the data in the proposed rule.  in addition, cms proposes to include hospital add-on payments such as indirect medical education (ime), disproportionate  share  hospital (dsh),  and  uncompensated  care  (uc)  payments  when calculating an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue, but will not include these payments when calculating beneficiary expenditures.\n hanys opposes these definitions that define the level of risk an aco will encounter and places  restrictions  to  the  number  of  agreement  periods. hanys  supports  the  american hospital  association  comments  that  both  cms  and  other  researchers have significantly overstated the degree to which the performance of hospital-led acos differs from that of physician-led  acos.   cms  should  not  base  a  major  redesign  of  the  mssp  participation options  on  a  single  methodological  approach,  nor  on  data  that  lack  clarity  and conclusiveness.\n aha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s analysis, using more appropriate definitions of aco composition, showed that acos with hospital participation actually saved more for the medicare trust fund than those without hospital participation. hanys urges cms not to move forward with these definitions and to seek ways to support these acos, rather than make it harder for them to achieve savings.\n in addition, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to use medicare revenue does not capture ownership or external private investment in the formation and management of an aco.  furthermore, including ime, dsh, and uc in the medicare revenue unfairly penalizes teaching hospitals or those that treat the uninsured population. if cms adopts these proposals, it may have a reverse effect where acos do not engage with teaching hospitals in their networks, limiting access to coordinated care. hanys strongly urges cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 not to include the add-on payments in determining an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue.\n agreement period cms proposes to extend the agreement period from three to five years, with july 1, 2019 as the start  date.   hanys supports this proposal to extend the agreement  period as it will help promote stability and  predictability for acos participating in mssp.   we also urge the agency  to  create  long-standing  rules  and  avoid  altering  them  mid-stream  in  an  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreement  period.   acos  need  reassurance  that  the  rules  on  which  they  base  their  initial investments on will be the same under which they will participate in mssp. it is essential that cms make no changes until an agreement period is complete.\n seema verma                                                                         page 4 october 16, 2018\n\n\n\n expansion of waivers cms proposes to expand access to waivers for risk-bearing acos under the basic track levels c, d, and e and those under the enhanced track.  specifically, cms would expand the three-day skilled nursing facility rule waiver for all acos in a two-sided risk model; and expand telehealth services for acos.  hanys supports these proposals.\n thank  you  for

weights that are applied to the difference between an aco's actual experience and the regional experience. the current weight is 70% and the proposal is a maximum of 50%. we believe that staying with the current weight is appropriate and we recommend not reducing the weights. the reasoning is that acos should be incentivized to perform well relative to their region (i.e. peers) and penalized when they do not perform well relative to their region. the current regional adjustment accomplishes this, and we feel it should remain in place. we believe by reducing the maximum percentage regional weighting, the incentive to perform well is lessened and may not have the desired impact.\r\n\r\nthe current proposal also includes a cap on the regional adjustment of 5% of the national medicare per capita expenditures and that cap would apply at each individual eligibility category. the current proposal would effectively apply a less than 5% overall adjustment if any of the four categories have less than a 5% adjustment. we believe that it is more appropriate to apply the 5% cap at the aggregate level and not the individual eligibility category level. this would reward acos for their overall performance and not penalize them if they perform well overall but are high in any one given eligibility category. we believe by reducing the ability to perform well across all categories by limiting to one of the four in this adjustment, the incentive to perform well is lessened and may not have the desired impact.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     ", "0341": "see attached file(s).\n\n\n\n october

electronically to: http://www.regulations.gov\n\n re: cms\u00e2\u0080\u00931701-p medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success.\n dear administrator verma:\n on behalf of the premier healthcare alliance serving approximately 4,000 leading hospitals and health systems, hundreds of thousands of clinicians and 165,000 other provider organizations, we appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) medicare shared savings program (mssp) pathways to success proposed rule. premier healthcare alliance, a 2006 malcolm baldrige national quality award recipient, maintains the nation's most comprehensive repository of hospital clinical, financial and operational information and operates one of the leading healthcare purchasing networks. our comments primarily reflect the concerns of our hospitals and health systems, their employed physicians and independent physicians aligned with them. premier runs the largest population health collaboratives in the country, the population health management collaborative, has worked with well over 200 acos and is currently comprised of more than 70 acos.\n premier collaborative participants have demonstrated the power of the aco model. since 2012, medicare accountable care organizations (acos) that participate in the premier inc. population health management collaborative (phmc) have outperformed their peers in achieving cost and quality improvements. nearly half of phmc medicare aco participants received shared savings payments in performance year 2016 compared to 33 percent of all medicare acos. in addition, since 2012 phmc medicare acos have performed 57 percent better on average in achieving shared savings.\n phmc medicare acos make up 6 percent of all medicare aco program participants but have generated 20 percent of the savings since 2012. in a recent analysis, premier projects that medicare could have doubled the $2 billion in savings it has achieved across its aco programs since 2012 if all participants performed at the average level of phmc members. additionally, in performance year 2016 nearly 75 percent of phmc medicare acos achieved savings for medicare, compared to 57 percent achieving savings for medicare across all medicare acos.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 2 of 16\n acos estimate savings are approximately 2 percent higher1. for example, peer-reviewed studies found that the mssp saved more than $200 million in 2013 and 2014 and $144.6 million in 2015 after accounting for shared savings bonuses earned by acos2. a similar study found that acos saved $1.84 billion from 2013 through 2015 and reduced medicare spending by $542 million after accounting for shared savings bonuses3. premier firmly believes that the aco model is a successful approach for encouraging providers to work together to reduce costs and improve the quality of healthcare for medicare beneficiaries.\n supporting the movement to these value-based payment models goes beyond the quality and financial results of acos. from a market perspective, we will never achieve innovation in healthcare except through the creative power of healthcare providers seeking to innovate the care delivery process. models in which payers seek to achieve savings and quality improvement will always fall short until healthcare providers themselves are held accountable for the results. we have seen firsthand the remarkable innovations that are spurred by this accountability such as those in telehealth, the hospital in the home, special care centers, organizing community support organizations and systematically addressing the social determinates of health.\n the pathways to success establishes a step-wise approach for acos increasingly taking on more downside risk. premier agrees that it is imperative that over time providers become increasingly responsible for total cost of care through risk-bearing agreements; however, cms must ensure providers have proper tools and experience to achieve this vision. we believe that with proper incentives and improvements in the program organizations will take on risk, seeing the quality, clinical innovation and business benefit from doing so. specifically, cms should consider the following within the context of mssp and any new payment models:\n sufficient time in an upside-only model prior to moving to downside risk. acos are more likely to achieve shared savings with time. specifically, studies show that the shared savings rate doubles with three years of experience from 21 percent for acos in the first year to over 40 percent for acos in the third of fourth year4. accordingly, premier recommends at least 3 years in an upside only model for new acos entering the mssp. beyond the mssp program, premier believes it is imperative for cms to provide a long-term vision and roadmap for the transition to value-based and risk-based models. in the absence of a clear timeline, some providers are reluctant to embark on new models. when providers have a clear plan for moving to new models (e.g. the maryland all-payer model), providers work aggressively to succeed in the model and more rapidly advance to the risk-bearing model.\n high performers should be encouraged to participate in models regardless of provider type. the mssp performance data summarizes average aco performance, masking differences among high and low performers within each category. we strongly discourage the application of policies targeting provider types that are intended to modify the behavior of the lowest performers; these policies impact high and low performers, thereby disincentivizing high performers from continuing in the model and producing savings. specifically, we request that cms eliminate the distinction of high and low revenue acos and avoid creating new blunt tools to define acos (e.g. physician-led and hospital-led). in any payment model cms should create a level competitive playing field and let those that perform best succeed most. cms should find non-provider defined approaches to eliminate poor performers.\n\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 3 of 16\n ensure a business case for taking on risk. cms must ensure that acos and new payment models, particularly voluntary models, provide incentives for taking on risk. the existing models to date have ignored the significant investment costs required to start or continue participation in a model. even when these costs are not incorporated into the payment model, providers will consider potential return on investment when determining whether to enter a new model. cms must recognize this dynamic and ensure that acos and other models will attract providers. specifically, cms should:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increase the shared savings rate for acos to at least 50 percent. as discussed below reducing the savings rate prevents acos from recouping initial investments, reinvesting savings into population health activities, and recruiting providers with the use of gainsharing agreements.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 provide additional flexibility in the models for acos taking on risk. to be best suited to take on more risk, within an aco or any payment mode, and effectively manage the care of populations providers require flexibility. while beneficial, the current approaches to providing flexibility (e.g. snf and telehealth waivers, beneficiary incentive program) represent limited portions of medicare benefits and thus limited opportunities for transforming care. within the next generation aco model cms incorporated several options that provide flexibility and should be considered for inclusion in the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0094choice on enrolling tin or npi, infrastructure payment, prepayment of shared savings and primary capitation. similarly, cms should consider aspects of medicare advantage that could be incorporated into acos. while ma is a capitated full-risk model, providers would benefit from the flexibilities in performance-based risk models. specifically, cms should consider incorporating utilization management into acos and expanding on the beneficiary incentive payment by incorporating aspects of the ma value-based insurance design (vbid) model, allowing acos to offer supplemental benefits or reduced cost sharing to aligned beneficiaries with specified chronic conditions, focused on the services that are of highest clinical value to them.\n\n redesigning participation options to facilitate performance- based risk\n phase-in of performance-based risk in the basic track\n cms proposes to redesign the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance-based risk tracks by retiring track 1 (no risk, upside only) and track 2 and creating a new basic track. in the basic track, participants could begin participation in a one-sided risk model and phase-in risk over the course of a single agreement period; the highest level of risk is comparable to the current track 1+. additionally, the proposed rule retains track 3, renaming it as the enhanced track. eligible acos would enter into these two tracks for an agreement period of 5 years (the first agreement period, if stated in july 2019 would be 5 years and 6 months). within the basic track, cms proposes a glide path that includes 5 levels: a one-sided risk model available only for the first two consecutive performance years (levels a & b), and three levels of progressively higher risk and potential reward in performance years 3 through 5 of the agreement period (levels c, d, and e). acos would automatically advance at the start of each participation years along this glide path until they reach the track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maximum level of risk/reward (designed to be the same as the track 1+ model).\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 4 of 16\n downside risk. numerous studies show that acos require about 3-4 years to become successful.5 this is not surprising given that acos receive feedback on their performance several months into their first agreement period\u00e2\u0080\u0095any initiatives designed to improve performance always take more time than anticipated, and this is particularly true for the complex organizations and agreements that comprise an\naco. under the current proposal, acos would have only one year of performance data before being \n required to move to a risk-based model. organizations need time to make the structural, cultural, and practice changes required to successfully manage and assume financial risk for a population. in recognition of the time required for acos to be successful, cms should allow at least three years of no-downside risk within the basic track to ensure the success of participating acos and encourage future participation. cms should extend an optional fourth year in a one-sided track for acos that achieve savings, not necessarily shared savings, across three performance periods and have high quality.\n shared savings rate\n premier strongly urges cms to set the entry-level risk for the basic track at 50 percent with gradual increases in the shared-savings rate as acos progress through the various levels. lowering the shared-savings rate for acos with no downside risk from 50 percent to 25 percent provides little incentive for new acos to join the program. the low shared-savings rate also does not consider the substantial investment needed on the part of acos. according to an analysis by the aha, the investment required to put in place and sustain the elements necessary for a successful aco has been $11.6 to\n$26.1 million higher than previous estimates by cms. these costs, coupled with the cost of having a \n repayment mechanism in place to cover losses, creates a high hurdle for organizations who are transitioning to accountable care.\n the proposed shared savings rate is a significant decrease for existing acos, which will be unable to reinvest savings back into population management and care coordination. shared savings payments are critical as part of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transformation toward value-based care and are necessary to incentivize providers to make the infrastructure investments needed to transform care delivery and processes. without them, acos will struggle to provide care and services needed to appropriately manage the health of the population and move more rapidly to risk, undermining the overall goal of the program. reducing shared savings also produces problems with provider participation and aco buy-in, as some organizations already find this difficult at current shared savings level. to incentivize acos to take on risk, cms should increase the shared-savings rates as acos take on additional risk. we recommend increasing the shared savings by 5 percent with each step: levels a/b: 50 percent; levels c/d: 55 percent; and level e: 60 percent.\n calculation of loss sharing limit\n premier supports using the lower of the revenue-based or historical benchmark for calculation of the loss sharing limit. however, we recommend that cms align the risk level for track e with the nominal risk threshold for apm models established under the qpp, which is 3 percent of the historical benchmark, rather than the 4 percent cms proposes. cms provides no rationale for setting the benchmark-based loss limit at the nominal risk standard plus one percentage point. the purpose of track e is to provide aco entities with a more gradual pathway to risk, while also meeting the requirements of an aapm. setting the historical-benchmark at a higher level would disproportionately affect acos with hospital participants and subject them to additional risk as they will always use the historical-based benchmark since medicare part a and b revenue will far exceed the historic-based\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 5 of 16\n benchmark. accordingly, increasing the benchmark-based loss limit creates an unlevel playing field for acos that include hospital participants this proposed policy is counter to the goal of acos to encourage providers to work together to improve care for beneficiaries and discourages both health-system led and physician-led acos from recruiting hospital participants.\n cms should allow all acos to remain in track e or whatever track meets the nominal risk requirements under qpp. if cms increases the qpp aapm nominal risk threshold, cms should create a glidepath in mssp for acos to transition to the new standard of risk.\n transition from level e to enhanced track\n premier urges cms to create additional levels within the enhanced track to build a more gradual transition from level e to enhanced. as proposed, many acos would not be eligible for the basic track or able to renew within the basic track for a second agreement period and would only have the option to enroll in the enhanced track. cms should either build a glide path to the highest risk level within the enhanced track or offer an additional track to help bridge the gap between the basic and enhanced tracks. to further maximize interest in acos transitioning to the enhacned track, cms should start the shared savings rate at 80 percent (same as the next generation aco program) and increase the maximum shared savings and losses rate over the agreement period.\n permitting annual participation elections\n annual risk election\n cms proposes to allow acos in the basic track to more rapidly transition (i.e., skip a level or levels) during the agreement period, but level e must be entered into no later than the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth performance year under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal. premier encourages cms to provide acos with more flexibility in their annual participation elections. if an aco selects a higher level of risk than it would have been automatically assigned, it should not be required to automatically advance the following year (i.e. an aco is not required to advance beyond the track they would have been assigned if they did not choose to advance to a higher track). as noted earlier, acos require additional time moving to risk. this option would provide acos the option to gain experience in a limited risk track for more than one year. additionally, we ask that cms consider allowing high performing acos more than one year in limited risk tracks (i.e. level c and d). cms could set parameters for successful acos to continue in a particular track prior to automatic advancing (i.e. achieving savings, not necessarily shared savings, and high quality).\n annual election of beneficiary assignment\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 6 of 16\n techniques from the start of the performance period on a population for whom they know they are responsible.\n determining participation options based on medicare ffs revenue and prior participation\n cms proposes to define participation options by making a distinction between low revenue acos and high revenue acos. high revenue acos are a proxy for acos that typically include a hospital billing through an aco participant tin; cms defines this as an aco whose total part a and b revenue for aco participants is greater than the total parts a and b expenditures for aco assigned beneficiaries. acos falling below this threshold are considered low-revenue acos, a proxy for physician group acos. cms believes that high revenue acos are more capable of accepting higher risk than low revenue acos. cms provides fewer participation options for high revenue acos. high revenue acos with \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d can only participate in the enhanced track regardless of whether they are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cre- entering\u00e2\u0080\u009d the program. in addition, low revenue (and inexperienced) acos may operate under the basic track for a maximum of two agreement periods, whereas high revenue acos are limited to one agreement period.\n premier strongly opposes this proposal and urges cms to eliminate the low/high revenue distinction for determining participation options. we firmly believe that all acos should the treated the same. this proposed distinction is unnecessary and harmful, as it would discourage acos that have the potential to generate substantial savings to the program from participating. the premise cms uses for hospital-led versus physician-led distinction is also flawed. cms argues that this policy decision is due in part to low revenue acos producing 2 percent of savings compared to 0.2 percent for high-revenue acos. a premier analysis of hospital-led vs. physician-led acos revealed two-major findings that refute this assumption: our analysis of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 definition of hospital-led (the aco includes a hospital tin participant) found that it is inaccurate with at least 20 percent of health system-led acos being designated as \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician led.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  some of the highest performing individual acos are hospital-led acos. twenty-one premier acos in mssp track 1 have achieved savings in multiple years of the program while also maintain quality higher than the national average. should they, therefore, be advantaged over physician-led acos?\n cms argues that many low-revenue acos are not well-capitalized and therefore unable to absorb losses as well as high-revenue acos. regardless of structure, significant investments are needed in population health platforms and care process changes for acos to bear risk. medicare revenue is also not indicative of ability to bear risk. cms is unable to identify if an aco is well capitalized through sources outside of medicare revenue (i.e., insurer or investor backed acos). accordingly, cms is unable to truly identify whether an aco is well capitalized and thus should not create distinctions based on assumptions about capital. setting up a system that disadvantages hospital-led acos limits the types of innovations needed to build a high performing healthcare system for the range of communities across the nation.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 7 of 16\n clinicians. the greatest fear related to consolidation is its potential to lead to higher prices. ultimately, the only way to protect against escalating costs is to advance these alternative payment models that hold providers accountable and give them the opportunity to improve care and reduce costs for an entire population.\n premier believes that the goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients. the best way to drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate, to innovate, and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare. including a hospital is an effective way to balance the need for access to specialty care while increasing the focus on primary care. one might argue that an aco should require a hospital participant and other providers across the care continuum to ensure that acos do not simply keep patients away from a particular setting but ensure patients receive care in the least restrictive setting. while it would be absurd to define what providers an aco must include, it is equally absurd to say that acos that work to include multiple provider types should be forced to risk sooner.\n premier believes that healthy market competition relies on a level playing field. this administration has been outspoken in advocating for market solutions and level playing fields among competitors. this proposed policy, however, is contrary to a market-based approach whereby all competitors have similar opportunities for success. whenever there is an uneven playing field, one competitor will use it to their advantage over another. alternatively, competitors can take steps to game the system. advantaging one group over another can also create perverse incentives to undermine a competitor overall.\n defining participation options by \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cms also proposes to limit participations options by categorizing acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d with performance-based risk medicare aco initiatives and determining participation options based on prior participation of aco legal entities and aco participants. cms defines a \u00e2\u0080\u009cre- entering aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d as (1) the same legal entity as an aco, identified by tin, or a (2) new legal entity that has never participated in the mssp and is applying to participate in the program and more than 50 percent of its aco participants were included on the aco participant list. cms defines an experienced aco that meets either of the following criteria: (1) the aco is the same legal entity as a current or previous aco that is participating in, or has participated in, a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under track 2 or track 3; or (2) 40 percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or in an aco that deferred its entry into a mssp agreement period under track 2 or track 3, in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n premier supports the participation options based on prior participation and definitions of renewing/re-entering acos and the 50 percent threshold. we generally support the cms definition of experienced but urge cms to increase the threshold from 40 percent to 50 percent to align with the new/re-entering definition. we also encourage cms to monitor the impact of this policy and consider creating an appeals process. for example, it is possible that two separate acos discontinue operation in a region then a new entity, completely unaffiliated with either prior entity, forms in the region and recruits participants involved in the prior organization. the intent of the policy is to avoid gaming of the options for the glidepath not to discourage new entities. to balance this potential outcome, cms should also consider a second criteria, setting a threshold for a percentage of participants that previously were in the same entity. for example, cms would first identify if 50 percent of participants would qualify an aco to be reentering or experienced; then, if less than 30 percent of participants were part of the same legal entity, the aco could appeal the label of reentering or experienced.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 8 of 16\n\n cms proposes additional provisions to address an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial performance when an aco may otherwise be in compliance with program requirements. cms states that just as poor quality performance can subject an aco to remedial action or termination, an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to lower growth in medicare ffs expenditures should be the basis for cms to take pre-termination actions. these actions could include a request for corrective action by the aco, or termination of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement. specifically, cms proposes to terminate acos if it is negative outside corridor for two agreement periods. cms appears to be particularly concerned about one-sided risk acos that continue to participate in the program and generate net losses to medicare.\n premier opposes the cms proposal to terminate acos if negative outside corridor for two agreement periods. we believe that these additional provisions, if implemented, would provide cms with too much discretion to terminate aco participation in the program. we are concerned that such unchecked authority provided to cms would further discourage acos participating in the mssp, as this would create additional uncertainty for participants and would also make it difficult to establish agreements with other organizations. moreover, cms proposals with respect to the glide path that would limit participation in one-sided risk models would also provide acos with incentives to leave the program if they were not able to generate savings.\n election of minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss rate (mlr) by acos\n cms proposes that acos under the basic track would have the same msr/mlr options that are currently available to acos under one-sided and two-side models of the mssp. acos under the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path in level a or level b would choose the msr/mlr to be applied before the start of their first performance year in a two-sided model. cms also proposes to use a variable msr/mlr when performing shared savings and shared losses if an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population falls below 5,000 for the performance year, regardless of whether the aco selected a fixed or variable msr/mlr. premier supports these proposals and appreciates the flexibility these options provide to meet acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs.\n participation options for agreement periods beginning in 2019\n cms proposes to offer a july 1, 2019 start date as the initial opportunity for acos to enter an agreement period under the basic or enhanced track. as proposed, acos that entered a first or second agreement period with a start date of january 1, 2016, may elect to extend their agreement period for an optional fourth performance year, defined as the six-month period from january 1, 2019 through june 30, 2019. cms notes that this election to extend the agreement period is voluntary and an aco could therefore conclude its participation in the program with the expiration of its current agreement period on december 31, 2018.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 9 of 16\n\n managing two distinct patient populations will require the aco to be responsible for the beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cost and quality during a time in which the aco is unable to manage the patient. as a result, acos will have to scale up resources and infrastructure for one performance period in order to mitigate the quality and cost impact. moreover, with little influence over beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expenditures outside of the performance period, acos could potentially be at risk for exceeding their benchmark. to mitigate this impact, cms should provide an option to allow acos in current models to extend their agreements for one year, resulting in a start date of january 1, 2020 for entering the new model. cms could still provide a july 1, 2019 start date option for new and existing acos. at a minimum, cms should use a singular assignment window and methodology to determine the assigned population for the entire calendar year 2019, regardless of whether they are in an extended agreement or the new model.\n finally, we are concerned that implementation issues could arise if cms rushes the application process, so we urge cms to ensure that there is enough time for cms and participants to prepare for an application cycle after the final rule. premier asks that cms delay the july 1, 2019 start and offer a one- year extension to all current acos who are ending their agreements if cms is not ready to implement a new model.\n benchmarking methodology refinements\n calculating growth rates used in establishing, resetting and updating the benchmark\n cms proposes to use what it refers to as a national-regional blend or a blend of national and regional growth rates to trend forward by1 and by2 to by3 when establishing or resetting an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical benchmark. cms would also use this approach to update the historical benchmark to the performance year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this would be calendar year 2019 for acos within the six-month performance period from july 1, 2019 to december 31, 2019. to calculate the national-regional blend, cms would calculate a weighted average of national ffs and regional trend factors, where the weight assigned to the national component would represent the share of assignable beneficiaries in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regional service area that are assigned to the aco. the weight assigned to the regional component would be equal to 1 minus the national weight. as an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s penetration in its region increases, a higher weight would be placed on the national component of the national-regional blend and a lower weight on the regional component, reducing the extent to which the trend factors reflect the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own expenditure history.\n premier appreciates that cms has responded to our previous concerns with solely a regional trend factor; however, we urge cms to adopt a policy premier and others have long recommended. that is, aco beneficiaries should be removed from the regional reference population. including the aco population in the reference population causes the aco to be compared to itself rather than the ffs medicare spending in the region. by including aco beneficiaries, the regional cost data incorporates efforts acos have made to reduce spending. as a result, benchmarks may diverge from the counterfactual spending, making it increasingly difficult for acos to achieve savings in comparison to the benchmark.\n use of regional factors when establishing and resetting acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benchmarks\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 10 of 16\n national per capita expenditures for parts a and b services in baseline year 3 for assignable beneficiaries).\n premier supports the cms proposal to incorporate the regional adjustment into the initial agreement period. we do not support lowering the regional contribution to below 50 percent and urge cms to maintain the current maximum contribution of 70 percent.  as such we recommend the following schedule of weights to be applied:\n schedule of weights for regional adjustment timing when subject to regional adjustment aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical spending is lower than its region aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical spending is higher than its region first time 30% 25% second time 50% 35% third  70% 50% all subsequent periods 70% 70%\n premier also supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed policy to cap regional adjustment at 5 percent of national expenditures to control for outliers. cms should, however, provide additional flexibility to incentivize acos to take on more risk. cms should provide an option for acos to use national benchmarks (in lieu of regional) for risk-bearing acos. this would be more desirable for acos in historically low spend regions that believe their targets are too low to take on downside risk.\n risk adjustment methodology\n premier appreciates the risk adjustment refinements cms proposes that would eliminate the distinction of newly and continuously aligned beneficiaries for purposes of risk adjustment. this appropriately recognizes that risk scores should increase or decrease during the course of the agreement period and that the beneficiary population underlying health changes with time. we urge cms, however, to raise the cap as +/- 3 percent is too restrictive; +/- 5 percent would more accurately account for changes in risk over a performance period. ideally, cms should provide additional incentives for acos to move to higher risk levels by providing additional flexibility in accounting for the risk of the population. this could be accomplished by allowing the cap to increase as acos take on additional risk. level e in the basic track, for example, would have a higher cap than levels c and d. we also believe that the cap for the enhanced track should align with the percentage change in risk scores for ma plans.\n\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements\n skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver expansion\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 11 of 16\n\n telehealth waiver expansion\n in keeping with the provisions of the bipartisan budget act of 2018 (bba 2018), cms proposes that existing originating site and geographic restrictions would be waived when medicare-approved telehealth services are furnished to ffs beneficiaries by mssp aco professionals. the waiver would take effect beginning with performance year 2020 and be limited to those acos that bear performance-based risk and to whom beneficiaries are prospectively assigned. the services must be billed through the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tin and may not be designated as inpatient-only. the expanded telehealth policy would apply to track 3 and to track 1+ acos as well as to those on the newly proposed enhanced track and on levels c, d, and e of the basic track.  premier strongly supports the telehealth expansion as proposed, particularly when combined with the increased flexibility that would occur with the proposed ability for acos to annually elect either prospective or preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment.\n other needed waivers\n premier notes once again that additional waivers are critical to removing persistent legal and regulatory barriers that inhibit mssp aco providers from working together to provide better-coordinated, high- quality care, most notably pertaining to the applicable fraud and abuse laws (e.g., the stark and anti- kickback statutes and the beneficiary inducements civil monetary penalty (cmp) provisions). premier continues to recommend that cms should issue: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an aco \u00e2\u0080\u009cpre-participation\u00e2\u0080\u009d waiver to protect aco-related start-up arrangements, in anticipation of new mssp participants and the proposed redesigned tracks; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an aco participation waiver that applies broadly to aco-related arrangements during the term of the participation agreement; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 a shared savings distributions waiver that applies to distributions and uses of any earned shared savings payments or internal costs savings.\n\n tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n beneficiary incentive program implementation\n beneficiaries assigned to mssp acos, regardless of assignment methodology, retain their rights to seek care outside of the aco without penalty. therefore, to effectively deliver value-based care, acos must seek to actively engage the beneficiaries for whom they will be held accountable for quality and cost; yet mssp acos are prohibited from marketing activities, such as those permitted for medicare advantage (ma) plans. current regulations do allow acos to provide in-kind items or services as incentives, the majority of which are judged on a case-by-case basis, but acos are inhibited by the simultaneously applicable statutes (e.g., anti-kickback and cmp provisions). the bba 2018 enables performance-based risk-bearing acos to establish incentive payment programs to encourage their assigned beneficiaries to obtain medically necessary primary care services, beginning no later than january 1, 2020. cms proposes implementing regulations, including aco eligibility and incentive program application and certification processes, with a start date of july 1, 2019 (coinciding with the first agreement period of the redesigned aco tracks). cms also addresses beneficiary eligibility, primary care services that would qualify for incentive payments, and incentive program recordkeeping, along with payment amount, timing, and distribution method.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 12 of 16\n provider and beneficiary burden. given longstanding concerns about compliance of aco incentive programs with applicable fraud and abuse laws, premier requests that cms provide template language for use by acos to notify beneficiaries about their new incentive programs. finally, since establishing a primary care incentive payment program is optional for acos, premier recommends that cms make available summary information about the uptake of beneficiary incentive programs when reporting overall mssp results. information from early adopters of incentive programs would be valuable to the remaining acos when making their decisions about applying to establish incentive programs.\n beneficiary notifications\n cms requires that mssp acos notify beneficiaries that their care is being furnished under a shared savings payment model and that they may opt out of having identifiable, claims-level data about themselves shared with their acos. cms has modified the content, frequency and delivery mechanisms for beneficiary notification multiple times since the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inception. currently, notices must be posted in acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 primary care delivery sites and a written beneficiary information notice must be provided upon beneficiary request. cms proposes to expand the requirements beginning july 1, 2019, creating a cms template notice, designed to be a comprehensive single source of mssp information that must be given to beneficiaries during their first primary care visit of each performance year. cms further proposes to add material to the revised notice informing beneficiaries of their option to voluntarily designate an aco professional to coordinate their care (i.e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary clinician\u00e2\u0080\u009d or\u00e2\u0080\u009d main doctor\u00e2\u0080\u009d), thereby implementing the voluntary alignment provisions of bba 2018.\n premier respects cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 intention to provide beneficiaries with sufficient information to make thoughtful and well-informed decisions about their healthcare, and we understand that cms must implement the bba 2018 statutory mandate for informing beneficiaries about voluntary alignment. premier, however, firmly opposes the proposed changes to provide beneficiary notification during the first primary care visit of each performance year. reasons for our opposition include the following: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 a comprehensive written notice at the time of a planned primary care visit is likely to overwhelm beneficiaries with information about myriad topics only distantly related to that visit. the clinical efficacy and experience of care for that visit are likely to be impaired and the information needed only for future use is unlikely either to be retained or to be readily retrieved later when needed. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 prior similar requirements for expanded notifications during primary care visits led to considerable confusion among beneficiaries; for example, some beneficiaries believed that the data-sharing notification was in reality an attempt by the aco to steal their identities. many acos had to reassign staff members from clinical duties to answering beneficiary questions about various notification provisions. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 clinical workflows and electronic record systems would require reconfiguration (e.g., scheduling additional visit time, incorporating reminder prompts and documentation of notification delivery) to assure that the required notifications occurred at the time of the initial primary care visit of each performance year. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 beneficiaries should be able to specify how information is most effectively exchanged with them by cms and by their acos (e.g., hard copy, 1-800-medicare, electronic mail).\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 13 of 16\n without input from those groups; their input should also guide delivery method choices made available to beneficiaries for various notifications.\n opt-in assignment methodology\n cms discusses at length and invites comments about all aspects of a hybrid assignment methodology that would include direct aco opt in (a beneficiary chooses assignment to a specific aco); voluntary alignment with an aco professional (with resulting assignment to the aco in which that professional participates); and a modification of the current claims-based assignment methodology (incorporating a minimum level of primary care visits furnished to a beneficiary). cms does not make any formal proposal about the hybrid methodology nor indicate a timeline for further consideration of its implementation.\n premier appreciates that cms is exploring the potential for opt-in assignment to increase aco beneficiary engagement that then could lead to more effective care coordination with improved quality and decreased costs. premier does not support implementation of the hybrid opt-in methodology as discussed in the rule at this time. instead, premier recommends that cms do the following: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 maintain the existing claims-based methodology combined with the voluntary alignment option (and minimizing the notification burden related to that option). \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 expeditiously test an option for beneficiary opt-in directly to an aco (in parallel to the existing beneficiary voluntary alignment directly to an aco professional). testing should explore appropriate marketing opportunities for acos analogous to those for ma plans. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 explore additional approaches hybrid assignment and choose one or more for limited-scale testing. before proposing any program-wide replacement mssp assignment methodology, cms should explore rules for rejecting opt-in or voluntary assignment (e.g. when a beneficiary resides outside the geographic region, when a beneficiary does not receive at least one service from a participating provider in the aco).\n\n updating program policies\n voluntary alignment policy revisions\n medicare ffs beneficiaries may choose to designate an aco professional as their primary clinician for coordinating their care, and the beneficiary who does so becomes voluntarily aligned to the designated professional\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aco. currently, a primary clinician must be either a primary care practitioner or practice one of a limited list of specialties (e.g., cardiology), and the beneficiary must have received at least one primary care service from a professional who practices primary care or a listed specialty in the aligned\naco. as part of bba 2018 implementation, cms proposes policy revisions to begin with performance \n year 2019 including removing the specialty restrictions to primary clinician eligibility and no longer requiring the voluntarily aligned beneficiary to have received any services from a professional in the aligned aco during the applicable beneficiary assignment window. premier supports the removal of specialty restrictions for primary clinicians but recommends retention of the requirement for a beneficiary to receive at least one primary care service from an aco participant.\n revised definitions of primary care for use in beneficiary assignment\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 14 of 16\n system (hcpcs) g-codes (e.g., depression screening) along with new g-codes proposed elsewhere in the rule (e.g., complexity inherent in office visits for certain specialties). cms also proposes to more accurately distinguish short-term, rehabilitation-related evaluation and management services provided in nursing facilities from ongoing primary care services furnished to longer-term nursing facility residents. cms would identify the former services by linking the appropriate cpt codes to nursing facility claims for the same dates of service rather than relying on the place of service code for snfs (code 31) as listed on the professional claim. premier supports the changes as proposed and agrees with cms that linking snf facility claims by date of service to professional claims will better identify short-term, rehabilitation-focused care that should not be counted as primary care services that contribute to beneficiary assignment to acos.\n extreme and uncontrollable circumstances\n in december 2017, cms issued an interim final rule with comment period that established policies to address quality performance scoring and shared loss determinations for mssp acos impacted by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances occurring in performance year 2017 (e.g., hurricanes and widespread wildfires). cms proposes some limited changes to update the existing policies for use in performance year 2018 and subsequent years, including revisions to align the performance scoring and shared loss determination processes with the proposed redesigned aco tracks. premier supports continuation of the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policies as applied in 2017 with the proposed revisions.\n program data and quality measures\n premier agrees with cms that the existing aco quality measure set appropriately emphasizes outcomes over process. premier also supports the goals of the meaningful measures initiative in general as well as the streamlined aco measure set for 2019 as proposed in the medicare physician fee schedule proposed rule. premier recommends that cms seek input from the measures application partnership to enhance the aco measure set by identifying measures that best reflect the focus of alternative payment models such as acos on care coordination and population health and that cms commit funding to development of such measures.\n cms states that the medicare program has become the largest payer for prescription opioids in the united states. as a result, medicare drug event records now constitute a substantial and critically important repository of substance use disorder data. cms currently provides part d prescription drug event data to each aco on a monthly basis, but items potentially related to substance use disorders are routinely de-identified, provided only in aggregate, or both. acos are held accountable for the total health of their beneficiary populations, but the ability of acos to most effectively manage population health is being increasingly constrained by the limited and non-specific substance disorder data with which they are provided. many beneficiaries are taking multiple medications and are at high risk for adverse drug interactions when opioids are prescribed for them. premier believes that it is unfair to hold acos accountable for measures of substance use disorder management until cms provides acos with access to the data necessary for instituting appropriate treatment (i.e., complete and identifiable data for all prescribed medications and their related diagnoses).\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 15 of 16\n and identifiable data from cms about substance use disorder--related diagnoses and services furnished to their assigned beneficiaries by providers to whom part 2 does not apply.\n cms further states that over one-third of beneficiaries assigned to mssp acos with continuous part d coverage have at least one opioid prescription but that rates vary substantially across acos (10-60%). premier firmly believes that such variability strongly suggests opportunities to improve the quality of care for substance use disorders in many acos. assuming that cms makes sufficient beneficiary medication data available, premier generally supports consideration by cms of adding opioid use measures to the mssp measure set. in particular, however, premier opposes addition of measures that focus primarily on opioid dosing (e.g., nqf #2951 use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer). premier is concerned that rigid adherence to dosing guidelines (e.g., the centers for disease control & prevention guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain) may cause serious adverse outcomes (e.g., depression, suicide) for patients being successfully managed on long-term opioid analgesics whose dosing regimens are abruptly changed to achieve guideline compliance.\n promoting interoperability (pi)\n cms seeks to harmonize mssp quality and health it activities with the quality payment program (qpp) through two actions that would become effective january 1, 2019: 1) retiring the aco-11 measure (use of certified electronic health record technology (cehrt)); and 2) requiring instead certification by each aco that the level of cehrt usage by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clinicians meets or exceeds the advanced apm cehrt threshold under the qpp. the latter requirement would become a condition of participation for all mssp tracks, and all payment models within those tracks, that also meet the financial risk standard required of advanced apms. premier supports both of these proposed actions regarding aco cehrt usage and appreciates the associated burden reduction for acos and their clinicians. however, the first change as proposed could potentially create disparate scoring standards for the promoting interoperability category in mips for aco clinicians that are not an advanced apm or do not meet the thresholds to be considered a qualifying participant. while the aco requirement is that clinicians would only have to certify cehrt usage, the mips requirement would require clinicians to actually submit pi data for scoring using mips-apm scoring standard. premier requests that cms avoid creating confusion by confirming that clinicians in acos that are mips apms would not be subject to full pi category reporting and scoring but instead could simply certify their cehrt usage. the pi category weight for such clinicians would then be redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories.\n pharmacy care coordination: request for comments\n premier supports exploration by cms of approaches that could facilitate collaboration between acos and part d stand-alone prescription drug plan sponsors and lead to improved outcomes, such as more widespread use of medication therapy management. cms should investigate ways to make complete pharmacy data more readily available to mssp acos and their clinicians. particular attention should be given to enabling technology methods (e.g., secure data access portals, data sets accessible using application programming interfaces) that could provide acos with real-time access to claims data (prior to or synchronous with claims processing) for their aligned beneficiaries. real-time access would allow acos to build provider alert processes that would improve care by triggering rapid clinical interventions when needed, as is being done already by some ma and commercial plans.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 16 of 16\n platform for testing multiple approaches, the most effective of which could be expanded to all acos. maximizing flexibility should be a guiding principle in designing such demonstrations; for example, allowing acos to select patient cohorts for whom to be responsible (e.g., high-risk patients with diabetes or patients with multiple chronic conditions)\n\n conclusion\n premier is committed to the success of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 alternative payment models and encourages cms to consider models beyond acos. specifically, we recommend cms consider: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 adopting a \u00e2\u0080\u009clayered payment model,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a provider-driven aco model that includes primary care capitation as well as inpatient and outpatient bundles within a global capitated amount along with legal waivers that will allow providers to employ tools similar to ma plans; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 testing a provider-driven global capitation models; for example, a model aligned with h.r. 5841 as introduced by reps. mike kelly and richard neale in the 114th congress.\n in closing, the premier healthcare alliance appreciates the

\u00ef\u0082\u00b7 section ii.a.3 creating a basic track with glide path to performance- based risk\n we  support  the  creation  of  a  new  basic  track  with  a  gradual  glide  path  to performance-based  risk.  however,  we  oppose the  significant  reductions  in  shared savings rates from the current track 1 shared savings rate of 50 percent to as low as 25  percent  under  the  proposed  basic  track  levels  a  and  b.  this  substantial reduction in shared savings rates would weaken the business case for new acos to form and for existing acos that require some additional experience before moving to downside  risk  to  continue  in  the  program.  we  recommend  that  cms  finalize  a savings rate of 50 percent for basic levels a and b, 55 percent for basic levels c and d, and 60 percent for basic level e.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 section  ii.a.5  determining  participation  options  based  on  medicare ffs revenue and prior participation\n options for renewing and re-entering track 1 acos\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow acos with no experience in performance-based risk  models  to  enter  a  new  agreement  period  in  basic  level  b.  we  believe  this gives acos with experience in the program but without experience in downside risk a reasonable amount of time in the new program structure before being required to move to downside risk. we strongly advocate for this proposal to be finalized rather than the more aggressive approach cms considered in which acos with experience in track 1 would be required to start at basic level c or higher.\n additionally,  we  support  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099  proposal  to  allow  acos  with  agreement  periods ending december 31, 2018 to extend that agreement through june 30, 2019.\n options for new acos\n we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to encourage providers to move to risk by introducing a structure  that  includes  a  more  gradual  glide  path  for  assuming  risk  through  the basic track. however, we have significant concerns that reducing the amount of time  available  in  shared  savings-only  models  would  discourage  new  acos  from forming and joining the  program, and  may encourage  acos  that would ultimately have been successful in the program to leave early. acos participating in the mssp over  a  longer  period  of  time  show  greater  improvement  in  financial  performance, demonstrating the value of such models and the need to allow acos sufficient time to demonstrate positive results.\n population health niyum gandhi evp & chief population health officer mount sinai one gustave l. levy place, box 1475 new york, ny 10029-6574 t 814-360-1120 f 212-410-6111 niyum.gandhi@mountsinai.org\nwww.mountsinai.org \n\n\n we recommend that cms allow new acos at least four years in shared savings-only arrangements to provide the acos with two to three years of performance data, the minimum  that  would  be  necessary  to  identify  trends  and  opportunities  for transformation and improvement before they have to decide whether to move to an arrangement  with  downside  risk.  for  example,  cms  could  implement  a  policy allowing all new acos to remain in basic level a for two years and basic level b for an additional two years before requiring the aco to move to level c in the fifth and final year of their agreement. alternatively, cms could allow new acos to remain in a shared savings-only track for the full five years of their first agreement period. these acos should then be permitted to begin their second agreement period at basic level c or d where they would participate for three years and progress to level e for the final two years of their second agreement period. we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow acos to progress more quickly to greater levels of risk if the aco chooses.\n differentiating between low revenue acos and high revenue acos\n while we appreciate the removal of the self-reporting requirements under the track 1+ model, we question the need to further divide acos into arbitrary categories of high and low revenue acos and to apply different schedules for how and when they must progress  along  the  risk  continuum.  we  oppose  categorizing  acos  in  this manner and the other options that cms considered (hospital vs. physician only, small\nvs. large) and urge cms to not finalize the high and low revenue distinctions. \n\n the  proposed  high  and  low  revenue  distinctions  create  unnecessary  program complexity, which cms has taken great strides to try to reduce across a variety of medicare programs in recent months. furthermore, the move creates uncertainty for acos  who may have  a  difficult time  predicting the category in which they would fall. this distinction would also change over time as aco participant composition changes, adding more complexity and making long-term planning very difficult.\n rather  than  finalize  unnecessary  and  arbitrary distinctions  for  acos,  cms  should work to support all acos as they progress on the value-based care continuum, and the agency should create meaningful incentives for acos to assume risk. the goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients, and cms should  adopt  policies  that  continue  to  engage  hospitals  as  key  players  rather  than create  incentives  to  exclude  hospitals  as  aco  participants.  the  best  way  to  drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate to innovate and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare.\n population health niyum gandhi evp & chief population health officer mount sinai one gustave l. levy place, box 1475 new york, ny 10029-6574 t 814-360-1120 f 212-410-6111 niyum.gandhi@mountsinai.org\nwww.mountsinai.org \n\n\n if cms does finalize a proposal to distinguish between acos, we recommend using a policy that allows acos to easily understand their options for participation ahead of time.\n related  to  this  proposal,  we  recommend  that  cms  not  require  any  acos  with experience in downside risk to move to the enhanced track. along with removing the  distinction between low and  high revenue acos, we  encourage  cms  to allow acos with experience in downside risk to enter basic level e or the enhanced track. the proposed policy to require certain acos to enter the enhanced track could be especially problematic for acos that moved to the track 1+ model mid- agreement period and would now, if considered to be high revenue, be required to make  a  significant  jump  from  the  track  1+  level  of  downside  risk  to  the enhanced level of risk with only minimal experience in performance-based risk.\n monitoring for financial performance\n we  are  concerned  about  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal  to  implement  financial  performance monitoring  in  the  manner  proposed  (i.e.,  that  cms  may  terminate  an  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation  agreement  if  the  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  expenditures  for  the  assigned  beneficiary population  exceed  the  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  updated  benchmark  by  an  amount  equal  to  or exceeding either the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative msr under a one-sided model, or the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mlr under a two-sided model after two performance years.) we believe this policy will have the unintended consequence of removing well intentioned acos from the program  who  might  otherwise  go  on  to  achieve  savings  and  make  quality improvements for their patients.\n population health niyum gandhi evp & chief population health officer mount sinai one gustave l. levy place, box 1475 new york, ny 10029-6574 t 814-360-1120 f 212-410-6111 niyum.gandhi@mountsinai.org\nwww.mountsinai.org \n\n\n\n further, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside the corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d sets a very low bar, especially for acos in downside financial risk models where the aco can select an mlr as low as 0 percent.\n should  the  agency  move  forward  with  this  type  of  early  termination  policy,  at  a minimum  it  should  be  used  only  in  rare  cases  where  the  agency  specifically  has documented program integrity concerns, and the corridor used to identify excessive spending should be higher than the one proposed.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 section  ii.d.2  risk  adjustment  methodology  for  adjusting  historical benchmark each performance year\n we  support  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099  proposal  to  revise  the  current  policy  that  treats  beneficiaries differently  depending  on  whether  they  are  considered  newly  or  continuously assigned. we also support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow risk scores to increase between benchmark year 3 and the performance year. instead of applying a threshold of +/- 3 percent, we recommend that cms finalize a cap of +/- 5 percent. we believe a larger cap is more appropriate given the potential for greater changes in acuity over a five year agreement period.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 section ii.d.3 use of regional factors when establishing and resetting acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benchmarks\n we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to introduce a regional expenditure component into  the  initial  agreement  period,  rather  than  waiting  until  at  least  the  second agreement  period.  this  is  especially  important  with  longer,  five-year  agreement periods.  we  also support  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued  application  of  one  of  two  regional expenditure components  based  on how the  acos  spending compares to that of its region, and the proposed 25 percent and 35 percent thresholds are appropriate.  we recommend cms finalize these policies as proposed.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 section ii.c.3 providing tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n beneficiary notifications\n population health niyum gandhi evp & chief population health officer mount sinai one gustave l. levy place, box 1475 new york, ny 10029-6574 t 814-360-1120 f 212-410-6111 niyum.gandhi@mountsinai.org\nwww.mountsinai.org \n\n\n notification  requirement  was  too burdensome.  we  are  concerned  that  requiring additional  notifications  will  take  time  away  from  other  important  conversations between providers and their patients and create confusion for beneficiaries who may worry  that  there  will  be  some  impact  to  their  freedom  of  choice  or  out  of  pocket costs.  we  recommend  that  cms  not  finalize  the  proposed  policies  and  instead maintain current beneficiary notification requirements.\n beneficiary opt-in based assignment methodology\n cms is seeking comment on possible future changes to the program that would rely on an opt-in process rather than claims-based attribution. we do not support moving in  this  direction  under  the  mssp.  altering  the  attribution  process  to  require beneficiaries  to  actively  elect  an  aco  would  create  substantial  administrative complexities that would likely be insurmountable for less well-resourced acos, and would be confusing to beneficiaries. as cms notes, this process would be similar to enrolling in an ma plan. for beneficiaries who have been in medicare ffs for many years and have not selected an ma plan, we do not believe they would be likely to enroll in an aco. beneficiaries would not have a clear financial incentive to enroll in an  aco  since  doing  so  would  have  no  effect  on  their  premium  or  cost-sharing arrangements.  additionally ffs  beneficiaries  often  place  a  high  value  on  their freedom of choice and may be concerned that enrollment would restrict their access to  a  particular  network.  we  believe  it  would  be  very  difficult  for  an  aco  to successfully enroll  a  sufficient  number  of  beneficiaries  to  meet  minimum requirements for an actuarially stable benchmark to be set.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 section ii.a.4.c proposals for permitting annual election of beneficiary assignment methodology\n we strongly support the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to provide acos with more flexibility in selecting a prospective or retrospective assignment methodology on an annual basis, and we urge cms to finalize this proposal.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 section ii.b fee-for-service benefit enhancements\n population health niyum gandhi evp & chief population health officer mount sinai one gustave l. levy place, box 1475 new york, ny 10029-6574 t 814-360-1120 f 212-410-6111 niyum.gandhi@mountsinai.org\nwww.mountsinai.org \n\n\n would be  appropriate  to make  them  more  broadly available.  although they can be seen as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccarrot\u00e2\u0080\u009d to encourage participation in tracks with more risk, we believe the new structure of the program involves sufficient requirements to move acos along that path, and that the availability of these waivers earlier on would enable acos to be more effective in managing utilization and providing high quality, person-centered care sooner.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 inclusion of mips adjustments in aco expenditure calculations\n we  urge  cms  to  exclude  mips  bonuses  as  aco  expenditures  under  the  mssp shared  savings  and  losses  methodology.  when  aco-attributed  patients  receive services  from providers  that  have  earned  positive  mips  adjustments,  it harms  the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to generate savings. this will be increasingly important over time as mips bonuses are projected to rise in future program years. the current cms policy creates misalignment between the goals of mips and the mssp. the better an aco and its eligible clinicians perform in mips, the greater the penalty when calculating shared  savings/losses  for  the  aco.  we  strongly  encourage  cms  to  amend  the current methodology to exclude these payment adjustments.\n thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  comment  and  for  your  consideration  of  our comments.\n sincerely,\n niyum gandhi

organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success\n 2\n 3\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 apg recommends that npi participation be allowed rather than just participation at the tin level \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 apg urges the agency to continue to work with stakeholders to reduce unnecessary quality measurements and develop additional quality metrics below we have provided detailed comments on the policies contained in the proposed rule.\n 4\n 5\n percent of low revenue acos shared savings compared to 23 percent of high revenue acos; and 42 percent of april and july 2012 starters shared savings, compared to 36 percent of 2013 and 2014 starters, 26 percent of 2015 starters, and 18 percent of 2016 starters. cms is proposing to allow acos to advance through the basic track and enhanced tracks based on their level of experience in mssp and their type \u00e2\u0080\u0093 namely high revenue or low revenue in parts a and b ffs. cms states that high revenue acos, which generally include hospitals, are more capable of controlling the total expenditures of assigned beneficiaries yet perform poorer than low revenue acos, which are typically physician led. based on this data, apg supports requiring experienced, high revenue acos to move to risk at a more accelerated rate. however, we caution cms to not punish early adopters and first movers. the track 1 plus aco program began this year. the first acos eligible for track 1 plus in 2018 included some aco in track 1 that opted to enter track 1 plus in their last contract year. these aco were in the 2016 cohort and could have remained in track 1 for 2018. these groups took the initiative to take on risk sooner than mandated and should not be penalized for being early adopters. under the proposed rule, these groups would be considered experienced and be required to enter the enhanced track with only one year of downside risk experience. apg recommends that these groups be allowed to enter the new program at basic level e. further, while apg certainly supports accelerating movement to risk as we know that two-sided risk models better align incentives high-quality, lower cost care, we are open to allowing high performing acos additional flexibility when entering and moving though mssp tracks and levels. those that are historically low performers should be required to either quickly demonstrate success or be terminated from the program. aco involuntary termination cms is proposing that if an aco is determined to be outside the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d then they have the right to require a corrective action plan for the first year followed by a termination from the program during the second year. apg supports the concept of terminating acos whose continual performance is a drain on the taxpayer or a result of gaming. however, we want to ensure that such a termination was is not for reasons outside of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control such as an overlapping cmmi model that is negatively impacting the aco financially. apg recommends that cms develop an appeal process in order for the aco to articulate if the reason for termination was due to extenuating circumstances. the aco should not be held to the consequences of unexpected financial loss.\n\n\n 6\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements snf 3-day rule waiver in the current regulations, the snf 3-day waiver is only utilized in tracks 1 plus and 3 where prospective attribution is employed. cms is proposing that effective july 1, 2019, all acos under a two-sided risk track (that would include all except level a and b in the basic track) would receive approval to utilize the snf 3-day waiver. cms notes that once the beneficiary is prospectively assigned to the aco, the 3-day waiver can be used even if the beneficiary is eliminated from the attribution list in subsequent quarters. apg welcomes this change in policy, however, we maintain that the waiver continues to be underutilized due to other reasons which must be modified. these include program requirements like a signed contract between aco and each snf. in order to utilize the snf waiver, two steps must occur: (1) a contract must be signed between the snf affiliate and (2) the aco must confirm that the snf has maintained a 3 star rating or above. the newly launched bundled payments for care improvement advanced (bpci-a) has streamlined the waiver process through an online xls file that cms maintains to verify which snfs are eligible and the ability to easily communicate to cms that the bpci-a participant will be utilizing the waiver in care redesign. apg recommends that the aco program adopts bpci-a approach to avoid undue burden and standardize the process among the models. telehealth services cms is proposing (under the direction of the bipartisan budget act (bba) of 2018, public law no: 115-123') that in 2020, acos under a two-sided risk track and utilizing prospective attribution (not preliminary prospective) be allowed to employ telehealth waivers with the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home as the originating site. apg supports the expansion of the waiver but recommends two adjustments. first, cms should allow for a july 1, 2019, start date to avoid confusion with the snf 3-day waiver. second, allow preliminary prospective models to participate. we understand that the latter is based upon an interpretation of the bba, however, since cms is proposing to allow attribution models to change on a yearly basis from prospective to preliminary prospective with a retrospective reconciliation, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense from a care delivery system to not include the preliminary prospective model. for example, an aco may be using telehealth for a beneficiary in december but once that aco switches to preliminary prospective in january, they are unable to provide the same service.\n\n\n 7\n provisions of the bipartisan budget act for telehealth in the shared savings program, beneficiary incentives beneficiary incentive programs cms is proposing to allow any aco in a downside risk model to provide an incentive payment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 no more than 20 dollars annually per service \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to any beneficiary completing a specific primary care service (e.g. an annual wellness visit). the benefit must be furnished by exclusively the aco and not by any of the aco partners including a hospital or acute care facility. apg supports the proposal to allow for beneficiary incentives, however, we recommend that cms modify it to allow any of the aco partners to furnish the incentive since they will share in the savings or losses. we do support the prohibition in accepting any financial support for the beneficiary incentives from pharmaceutical or medical device companies. since cms has lifted the uniformity standard for the medicare advantage (ma) plans to allow medical and nonmedical services to be provided to targeted populations, it has become clear that the usage of nontraditional services such as transportation and food delivery are essential to achieve high quality and low-cost goals. apg recommends that cms facilitate a mechanism for acos to be afforded the same opportunity to address socioeconomic variables through billing for the service as an additional benefit or allow acos to receive the services as in-kind donations from community agencies. coordination of pharmacy care for aco beneficiaries cms has suggested that pharmacists and aco providers can work more collaboratively through data sharing. apg supports opportunities for data sharing among not only pharmacists but any clinical partnerships used in collaboration with aco providers.\n 8\n call, or through the other modifications in emedicare.gov would lead to greater adoption. apg supports the opportunity for beneficiaries to participate in voluntary alignment by selecting their primary care clinician, but we advocate for a more streamlined selection process. opt-in cms is proposing to include a new \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d methodology that allows the beneficiary to proactively select an aco. this would facilitate the recognition of the value of the aco as an entity. apg supports this new concept and believes that it would begin to lead to an enhanced integration between the aco and the beneficiary. currently, most beneficiaries are unaware of the presence of an aco and even if they are a part of one. with the advent of an \u00e2\u0080\u009copt in\u00e2\u0080\u009d assignment, acos can now begin marketing the aco as an entity which could include quality statistics. this is similar to a selection of a network that employees enroll into on a yearly basis thus, would be familiar. participant list in the current program, cms requires the participant list to be at the tin level and an aco cannot add or drop throughout the year. however, if a tin has poor quality, a group may terminate them from the aco but then that tin still remains on the participant list for the entire year. this greatly impacts aco quality and also allows the poor performing tin to have access to the five percent incentive bonus if the aco is an advanced apm. apg believes that acos should be able drop poor performers from the participant list throughout the year. apg also recommends that acos be allowed to enter npis rather than just tins on their participant list. this would allow acos to select npis that are able to demonstrate high quality and efficient practice patterns thereby enhancing the acos performance. additionally, as the qualifying apm participant (qp) threshold increases, many acos participants are considering reconfiguring tins into two separate groups for specialists and primary care providers in order to qualify as qp in the advanced apm. allowing npi designation on the participant list would alleviate the additional burden of developing two tins for multispeciality groups.\n 9\n benchmark 3 and performance year will lead to a larger percentage of participants exceeding the cap as the contract years go by. apg recommends that the risk adjustment benchmark should be based upon a rolling methodology similar to the next generation aco program. the change in adding regional benchmarking to the first agreement period is very beneficial for efficient providers that continue to struggle to beat historical benchmarks. apg supports this modification but we believe that capping the regional portion at 50 percent is unnecessary and should remain at 70 percent to continue to support efficient providers. apg recommends that cms convene a panel of experts to improve and strengthen the risk adjustment and benchmarking aspects of the program due to the inconsistency of the methodology between aco models, ma, and other apm models including bundles. trend factors cms is proposing to move from a regional-only trend factor to a blend of regional and national. apg strongly supports the movement away from regional only to a more blended approach, however, benchmark methodology should be modified in areas that have a low spending growth trend. the current proposed rule penalizes organizations with historically low spending growth by holding them to a higher standard than those who are in high spending growth areas. we propose that organizations that are 1) in regions with growth trends below the national average, and 2) have historical spending at or below 85 percent of the national average receive an additional three percent increase to their trend factor. this change to the benchmark would encourage organizations in california and other efficient areas to transition to a risk based apm instead of continued mips participation. we understand that though the selection of risk adjustment and benchmarking methodology is crucial in the long-term sustainability of the program, cms must balance the needs of the high/low cost and efficient areas. apg recommends that cms convene a panel of experts on an annual basis to improve and strengthen the risk adjustment and other benchmarking aspects of the program by exploring additional methods to adjust for variables outside the control of the aco.\n 10\n including the next generation aco program and this change will help eliminated unnecessary burden. apg urges the agency to continue to work with stakeholders to reduce unnecessary quality measurements and better develop additional quality metrics in a way that supports support ongoing activities in the patient over paperwork and meaningful measures initiatives. specifically, apg askes that cms consider social determinants of health (sdoh) factors when risk adjusting aco quality metrics. research had demonstrated that sdoh are significant driver of both cost and outcomes. it is critical that cms consider these factors when evaluating aco performance.\n conclusion the medicare shared saving program provides an opportunity to advance risk-based coordinated care in traditional medicare and is a component in moving our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delivery system from volume to value. because of that, mssp policies must be carefully crafted to not only encourage participation in the program but also incentivize the movement to two-sided risk models. sustaining mssp requires that cms strike a balance between the needs of participating acos and the needs of the federal government. while apg remains supportive of mssp and we certainly hope to continue to work with cms to strengthen and improve the program, we also recognize the advancement of other advanced apms and value-based models in ma. mssp is an important program aimed at improving value in traditional medicare, but apg also eagerly looks forward to the next iteration of value models in part b including the forthcoming direct provider contracting (dpc) model. apg has provided details based on our third option of how this model would work, and we are pleased to continue to provide expertise in this respect as cms moves forward. we thank you in advance for your consideration and appreciate the opportunity to submit

half of the aco contracts in 2018, and each contract averaging 24,300 lives versus 17,500 under medicare.2\n 1 http://hcp-lan.org/workproducts/apm-measurement-final.pdf 2 david muhlestein, robert saunders, robert richards, and mark mcclellan, recent progress in the value journey: growth of acos and value-based payment models in 2018, health affairs blog.\n\n october 16, 2018 page 2\n\n\n\n\n figure 1. accountable care contracts over time\n\n\n\n\n many of the providers with whom our members have such arrangements also serve medicare ffs patients through mssp contracts. we find that aligning incentives, both cost and quality, across payers serves to create synergies that advance the respective programs further and faster. this is one reason ahip partners with cms on the core quality measure collaborative that seeks to align measures across public and private payer contracts, including a core measure set specifically for use in assessing acos and medical homes. providers with aligned multi-payer models are subject to less burden and can dispense with hedge strategies, allowing them to dive head long into transformation. thus, a stable and successful mssp program is crucial to the ongoing success of private sector models as well.\n our specific comments are based on the extensive experience of our member health plans implementing acos and other alternative payment models (apms) and are focused on the following areas:\n october 16, 2018 page 3\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 redesigning participation options, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 refining the benchmarking methodology, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 providing tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 enhancing fee-for-service benefits, and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 updating program policies.\n redesigning participation options\n cms proposes to discontinue track 1, track 2 and future applications for track 1+ mssp models. in their place, cms proposed to crease two new tracks: a basic track, which incorporates elements of the current track 1+ model, and an enhanced track based on the current track 3 model.\n in the future, cms should conduct a formal evaluation, in addition to the public use file, of the mssp and share it with stakeholders in advance of rulemaking to aid in the preparation of comments.\n basic track\n transition timing\n the basic track includes a path towards progressively higher increments of risk and potential reward. the glide path includes 5 levels:  a one-sided model available only for the first two years to eligible acos and three levels of progressively higher risk and potential reward in years 3 through 5 of the agreement period.\n we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 effort to simplify the participation options and establish a clear path to provider risk-bearing models. we agree that it is important for providers, once ready, to accept financial risk to encourage success and protect against possible increased spending. our members report that it commonly takes 3 to 4 years of non-risk bearing models prior to the providers being adequately equipped to manage risk. thus, while the existing 6 years may be too generous, declining to two years may be overly ambitious. even if providers are not immediately taking on programmatic risk, they are taking on other forms of business risk. a sufficient glidepath is key to encouraging organizations to embark on the arduous journey of delivery system transformation and turn away from the ffs incentive to drive volume.\n october 16, 2018 page 4\n outcomes in care. a 2017 health and human services (hhs) office of inspector general report found that acos achieved high quality and noted progress on important measures including reduced hospital readmissions and screening beneficiaries for risk of falling and depression. 3  it is this foundational change that we see pay dividends in out years. an analysis by avalere of the 2017 mssp results finds that acos in the program for at least 3 years performed better than newer acos as displayed below in figure 2. acos with 1-2 years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experience in the program increased medicare spending. given the very modest average savings in year 3, and that providers may not surpass the minimum savings rate, it is understandable that they would be hesitant to accept risk in that year.\n figure 2: net reduction in medicare spending per beneficiary by aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number of years in program\n\n moreover, enhanced risk does not inherently equal heightened results. in 2017, track 1 acos outperformed the risk-bearing tracks two to one in terms of average savings per beneficiary according to analyses by the national association of acos using the cms public use file displayed in table 1 below.\n\n october 16, 2018 page 5\n table 1: net savings for acos based on track\n track net savings to medicare (millions)* mean savings per beneficiary percent acos generating savings track 1 $290 $138 33% track 2/3 $23 $55 51% *net savings factors in bonuses paid to acos\n cms must strike a delicate balance between program improvements that will drive additional savings and robust participation in the program. we urge cms to allow for three years of the up-side only model rather than the proposed two years to encourage new entrants.\n sharing rate\n cms proposes an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maximum shared savings rate would be 25 percent, based on quality performance, during the one-sided model years. the glide path concludes with a maximum 50 percent sharing rate and a maximum level of risk of 30 percent capped at either 8 percent of an acos revenue or 4 percent of the benchmark. this final level of risk under level e would qualify as an advanced alternative payment model (apm) for purposes of the quality payment program (qpp).\n cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal would reduce the sharing rate by 50 percent compared to its current level. our members, in working with providers to establish acos, find that there are significant investments required in the early phase. thus, a 25 percent sharing rate is not likely to provide the necessary return on investment to precipitate entry into the program.  ahip and its members urge cms to maintain the existing 50 percent sharing rate as a minimum and grow the sharing rate as the providers progress to risk.\n loss rate\n october 16, 2018 page 6\n\n level advancement\n acos in the basic track glide path would be automatically advanced at the start of each performance year along the progression of risk/reward levels or could elect to move more quickly to a higher level of risk/reward over the course of their agreement period. we concur with cms that a clear path to risk on a set schedule would benefit the program, provided the transition is modified per above.  ahip and its members support the automatic advancement to the next level of risk/reward, including the option for providers to elect to advance to higher levels faster.\n enhanced track the proposed enhanced track mirrors the existing track 3 with a maximum up-side and down-side of 75 percent. as proposed, acos identified as experienced with performance-based risk medicare aco initiatives, such as acos identified as having previously participated in the program under track 2, track 3 or the track 1+ model, are restricted to participating in either the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest level of risk and reward (if the aco is identified as a low revenue aco) or the enhanced track. acos identified as low revenue could participate in the basic track for up to two agreement periods. acos identified as high revenue would be required to transition to the enhanced track after no more than a single agreement period under the basic track. we note that the jump from level e of the basic track with 30 percent downside risk to the enhanced track of 40 to 75 percent downside risk depending on quality measure performance could be significant. cms should consider a glidepath within the enhanced track to facilitate a smooth transition from the basic track and maintain program stability.\n prospective or retrospective assignment cms proposes to allow basic and enhanced track acos to elect prospective or retrospective assignment prior to the start of each agreement period, and to change that selection for each subsequent performance year. while the balanced budget act of 2018 required cms to make this option available starting january 1, 2020, in this rule, cms proposes to begin the policy july 1, 2019. the option allows acos to elect prospective assignment, which is more akin to their private plan contracts and allows them to be certain of their patient population for the year.  however, it also offers smaller acos an option that permits them to grow their population during the year.  ahip supports cms implementing the choice between prospective or retrospective assignment in 2019 instead of 2020 to coincide with the next application cycle.\n october 16, 2018 page 7\n for agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years, eligible acos would enter into one of the two tracks for an agreement period of not less than 5 years. a 5-year agreement periods demonstrates a commitment to the program and delivery system transformation. moreover, it provides for a longer transition period and ability to measure success. however, the underlying make-up of the aco may change demonstrably over that time. we support the move to 5-year agreement periods but encourage cms to use its authority to re-establish a benchmark if the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s composition significantly changes.\n\n benchmarking methodology refinements\n regional benchmarks cms proposes a revised benchmarking methodology that would incorporate factors based on regional ffs expenditures in establishing the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical benchmark beginning with the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first agreement period, rather than applying this approach starting in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second or subsequent agreement period. cms proposes to mitigate the effects of excessive positive or negative regional adjustments used to establish and reset the benchmark by reducing the maximum weight used in calculating the regional adjustment from 70 percent to 50 percent and capping the regional adjustment amount using a flat dollar amount equal to 5 percent of national medicare ffs per capita expenditures.\n while medicare cannot individually negotiate each contract, it can ensure that it maintains sufficient options within the program to address a few key scenarios to ensure robust participation in the model. the existing transition to regional benchmarks was intended to provide a path for both the low and high-spending providers at the same time. we agree that moving toward regional benchmarks is an important goal and would provide additional symmetry with the ma program. however, cms must proceed in a way that preserves and even encourages participation by the high-spending providers in what is a voluntary program. moving to regional-adjusted benchmarks too quickly will dampen participation by high-spending providers; the very providers we should be targeting.  the faster transition to risk bearing will further exacerbate this perverse incentive. if only the lower spending providers remain, cms will not only lose the opportunity to realize savings from the high-spending providers, but it will subsidize the low-spending providers who are inherently below the regionally-adjusted benchmarks. cms should not pursue a national-regional blended rate trend, but rather should remove acos from the regional reference population to establish a true comparison of the acos relative value.\n october 16, 2018 page 8\n the current risk adjustment policy does not allow for any increases in risk scores for the continuously assigned population except for the increase associated with age. however, cms allows for decreases in risk scores with no exceptions. in this rule, cms proposes to eliminate the distinction between new and continuously assigned beneficiaries and to cap the risk score change over the course of the contract at +/- 3 percent of the risk score for benchmark year 3.\n as it would be simpler, we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to dispense with the differentiation between new and continuously assigned beneficiaries. however, we are concerned that a 3 percent cap on both populations over a 5-year period will dramatically underestimate the changes in the acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 populations. in addition, cms has found that the secular trend in risk score growth among medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries over a 5-year period may be greater than 3 percent on average. for example, on an annual basis cms estimates the growth in beneficiary risk scores over time to calculate a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormalization\u00e2\u0080\u009d factor that is applied to the ma risk adjustment model. this factor adjusts ma enrollee risk scores for risk score growth that has occurred in the ffs population in the years after the risk adjustment model was last calibrated. according to the table below published in the cy2019 advance notice of methodological changes, beneficiary risk scores in the ffs program on average grew either 3.9 percent (left column) or 3.6 percent (right column) over the 5-year period 2013 to 2017.4\n\n\n furthermore, acos will not be able to replicate any of the risk score calculations and will not understand the full effect of the policy until the end of the agreement period. reasonable growth in risk scores should be permitted to accurately and fairly account for a complex and aging\n october 16, 2018 page 9\n population in a medically managed environment. cms should not impose a cap on beneficiary risk score growth and should look to the normalization process within the ma program as precedence for developing a normalization factor to adjust for risk score growth based on estimated growth in the ffs population excluding the aco assigned beneficiaries.\n use of reinsurance cms notes in the rule its concern about continued participation by poor performing acos under performance-based risk based on an ability to obtain reinsurance to offset their liability for shared losses. while cms considered prohibiting acos from obtaining reinsurance to mitigate their performance-based risk, it believes such a requirement could be overly restrictive and that the proposed financial monitoring approach would be effective in removing from the program acos with a history of poor financial performance.\n we agree with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment that prohibiting acos from obtaining reinsurance would be overly restrictive. cms should not only allow mssp participants to use reinsurance, but also return it to the list of qualifying repayment guarantees. reinsurance is an important tool used by provider organizations who participate in capitated and other risk-based contracts. it allows these organizations to titrate the amount of risk they bear to their balance sheets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 capacity to absorb losses. while the mssp model may begin with an up-side only structure, there are other forms of risk associated with beginning an aco such as capital investments, and the risk grows over time based on cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed glidepath. moreover, the providers must consider their full book of business, not just medicare ffs, when determining the best way to protect against losses. while cms may want to limit the extent to which losses can be offset to ensure the providers have sufficient incentive, it should not limit providers ability to insure against the closure of their practice. we do not want to see unintended consequences for beneficiary access as the program progresses. therefore, we believe it is important to allow organizations with nascent risk bearing experience access to tools like reinsurance to help them better manage their financial risks.\n providing tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n october 16, 2018 page 10\n goods or services (including certain gift cards in the nature of a voucher), are considered to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cin-kind items or services\u00e2\u0080\u009d that may be provided to beneficiaries so long as the vouchers meet all other program requirements including a reasonable connection to the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical care.\n to create a level playing field, cms should strive toward parity between the aco and ma plans wherever possible. this proposal does not align with the rewards and incentives requirements for ma plans, which prohibit the offering of rewards and incentives in the form of cash or cash equivalents and only permit offering gift cards or coupons if they are not redeemable for cash. cms should hold acos to the same standard as ma plans by requiring the beneficiary incentive payments be in the form of gift cards or coupons that are not redeemable for cash.\n voluntary assignment cms proposes modifications to the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing policies on voluntary alignment in order to comply with the bipartisan budget act of 2018, by allowing beneficiaries to designate a physician regardless of specialty or a nurse practitioner, physician assistant or clinical nurse specialist as their \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary clinician\u00e2\u0080\u009d responsible for coordinating their overall care. cms will continue to use a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designation to align the beneficiary to the aco in which their primary clinician participates even if the beneficiary does not continue to receive primary care services from an aco professional in that aco.\n ahip supports the voluntary assignment methodology, which gives medicare beneficiaries the opportunity to take an active role in their health care decisions and reinforces the patient- provider relationship. we recommend that cms evaluate acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experiences with the process during the first years of its implementation and continue to refine the methodology based on stakeholder feedback.\n october 16, 2018 page 11\n\n ahip supports the existing voluntary assignment process that began in 2017 and believes cms should focus on fully implementing that process before it considers others. given that beneficiaries do not have a good sense of what acos are, we believe it would be very confusing to beneficiaries to offer such an opt-in process. there is significant difference between a beneficiary acknowledging a relationship with a trusted primary clinician with whom they interact directly and aligning themselves with an aco that largely plays a behind-the-scenes role.\n we feel that an annual enrollment period would cause significant confusion between an mssp opt-in and an ma enrollment. furthermore, it would create substantial administrative burden for itself and for providers by creating and maintaining the vast amount of regulatory guidance and infrastructure needed to operate an opt-in assignment enrollment system like the one used in ma, including detailed marketing and communication guidelines, beneficiary protections, web development, and requirements for potential agents/brokers. if this were to be implemented, there would need to be parity between ma and aco marketing and communication regulations and guidelines.\n lastly, we feel this methodology raises significant concerns about gaming, as acos may be incentivized to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccherry pick\u00e2\u0080\u009d and enroll healthier patients who have had no previous interaction with the aco through a primary clinician. if implemented, cms must establish a robust system to monitor this process for potential fraud and abuse.\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements\n telehealth cms proposes that beginning in january 1, 2020, eligible physicians and practitioners in applicable acos in performance-based risk tracks (basic track level c-e and the enhanced track) could receive payment for telehealth services furnished to prospectively assigned beneficiaries even if the otherwise applicable geographic limitations are not met, including when the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home is the originating site. this policy would apply to acos that elect prospective assignment only. cms also seek comment on an approach that could allow for expansion of this policy to acos under performance-based risk that have selected preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation, instead of prospective assignment, as their assignment methodology.\n october 16, 2018 page 12\n not only ensure a level playing field across risk-bearing organizations, but also increase beneficiary access to timely, high-value care. we urge cms to allow ma plans and medicaid managed care organizations (mcos), who already have significant experience with risk-based contracts, to maximize the benefits of telehealth services by removing unnecessary barriers to their use. in the future, we recommend cms pilot expansion of this policy to acos in one-sided models to determine the appropriateness of allowing expanded telehealth services in this population.\n snf 3-day waiver cms proposes to allow eligible acos in performance-based risk tracks (basic track level c-e and the enhanced track) use of the existing skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver, regardless of their choice of prospective assignment or preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation, to support aco efforts to increase quality and decrease costs. cms also proposes amending the existing snf 3-day rule waiver to allow critical access hospitals and other small, rural hospitals operating under a swing bed agreement to be eligible to partner with eligible acos as snf affiliates for purposes of the snf 3-day rule waiver.\n ahip supports these proposals. however, we are concerned that this proposal may have the unintended consequence of generating inappropriately denied snf claims, which may result in beneficiaries being charged for covered snf. this is more likely to occur with acos that choose preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation. cms should closely monitor the extension of the snf 3-day waiver for potential unintended consequences and update the provision as needed in response.\n updating program policies\n october 16, 2018 page 13\n retire the current ehr quality measure (aco-11: use of certified ehr technology) for performance years starting on january 1, 2019.\n ahip supports allowing for flexibility in the adoption of cehrt among acos participating in mssp. we support aligning the threshold for acos in mssp tracks that qualify as advanced apms with the thresholds used in the qpp. we also support a lower threshold of 50 percent for those acos in tracks that do not qualify as advanced apms. ahip supports retirement of the aco-11 measure dependent on cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 adoption of its proposals related to cehrt use.\n program data and quality measures cms seeks comment on approaches to developing the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality measure set in response to the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative as well as to support acos and their aco providers/suppliers in addressing opioid utilization within the ffs population.  cms seeks comment on existing sources of program data that may be useful for acos to monitor trends in opioid utilization and suggestions for providing additional parts a, b and d data and aggregate statistics to acos.  cms also seeks comment on quality measures that could be used to assess factors related to opioid utilization. cms is considering three measures in particular:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 nqf #2940: use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 nqf #2950: use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 nqf #2951: use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer\n october 16, 2018 page 14\n\n ahip supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to address opioid utilization through the mssp program. we encourage cms to examine opioid utilization measures currently in use in other programs and make every effort to align the mssp set accordingly. we also note that the cqmc is currently in the process of reconvening its workgroups to update its core measure sets. after that process is complete, cms should make every effort to update the cy 2020 mssp set accordingly.\n coordination of pharmacy care for aco beneficiaries cms seeks comment on approaches for encouraging medicare acos to collaborate with the sponsors of stand-alone part d pdps to improve the coordination of pharmacy care for medicare ffs beneficiaries to reduce the risk of adverse events and improve medication adherence. specifically, cms seeks comment on the following: the kinds of support that would be useful for medicare acos and part d sponsors in establishing new, innovative business arrangements to promote pharmacy care coordination; how cms, medicare acos and part d sponsors might structure the financial terms of these arrangements to reward part d sponsors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 contributions towards achieving program goals, including improving the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coordination of care; whether acos are currently partnering with part d sponsors; if there are any barriers to developing these relationships; and recommendations for how cms can assist with reducing barriers and enabling more robust data sharing.\n ahip supports increased collaboration between stand-alone part d sponsors and entities such as acos to improve outcomes for medicare beneficiaries. cms should encourage part d sponsors to enter into such arrangements by removing barriers that limit sponsors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to design and manage formularies and drug utilization. this will allow them to better promote clinician formulary compliance and respond to the needs of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population, such as by increasing medication adherence. for example, removing certain regulatory barriers (e.g., protected class drugs, two drugs per class requirement) or affording plans the ability to create preferred and non- preferred specialty tiers could allow part d sponsors to work with acos to optimize formulary design in addition to generating valuable beneficiary savings. ahip believes that providing more formulary flexibility to plan sponsors is a critical step in ensuring a robust collaboration with other entities such as acos.\n october 16, 2018 page 15\n circumstance, as determined under the qpp, or that the aco's legal entity is located in such an area, the aco's minimum quality score would be set to equal the mean quality performance score for all shared savings program acos for the applicable performance year. if the aco is able to completely and accurately report all quality measures, cms would use the higher of the aco's quality performance score or the mean quality performance score.\n as stated in the shared savings program ifc, cms will reduce an aco's shared losses, if any, determined to be owed under the existing methodology by an amount determined by multiplying the shared losses by two factors: (1) the percentage of the total months in the performance year affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance; and (2) the percentage of the aco's assigned beneficiaries who reside in an area affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance. this proposed approach would also apply to acos that are liable for a pro-rated share of losses as a consequence of voluntary termination of a 12-month performance year after june 30 or involuntary termination by cms.\n ahip supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to extend the policies for addressing the impact of extreme and uncontrollable circumstances on aco financial and quality performance results for performance year 2017 to performance year 2018 and subsequent years. however, we feel more needs to be done to account for the impact of a natural disaster on an impacted aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial performance and ability to report quality measures.\n while the current policy addresses acos that are expected to have shared losses based on performance prior to a natural disaster and have increased shared losses after a natural disaster, it does not address an increase in annual per capital expense as compared to the benchmark/minimum savings rate/minimum loss rate. due to these limitations of the current policy, we instead recommend that cms revise the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy to provide a trend/growth rate that is the higher of the national assignable rate or the regional rate. further, the regional rate should be calculated by excluding the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries.\n the current cms policy awards an average quality score to those affected by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, which can unfairly penalize high performing acos. we recommend cms use an approach similar to the policy currently used in the ma program and award a quality score that is the greater of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality score for the affected performance year, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prior year quality score, or the national mean quality score.\n october 16, 2018 page 16\n creating new modifiers to better identify impact at the beneficiary and claims level by accounting for unsafe place of discharge. cms should also consider adjustments to account for acos that experience extreme and uncontrollable circumstances when calculating total revenue for the purposes of participation track eligibility, determining whether an aco has generated losses that were negative outside corridor and the pre-termination actions that can result, and calculating the repayment mechanism amount.\n thank you for the opportunity to comment on these important issues.  if you have any questions, please contact me at (202) 778-3246 or at dlloyd@ahip.org.\n\n sincerely,\n\n", "0347": "please find the attached comments of the american association of nurse practitioners 3 ensure that the template states that  patients are authorized to choose  nurse practitioners as their designated aco professionals within the mssp. cms also requested feedback on an opt-in option for beneficiaries to choose to participate in an mssp\naco. our concern is that the similarity between the opt-in option and the voluntary alignment option \n may cause confusion among beneficiaries. if cms does move forward with an opt-in option, we would recommend aligning it with the voluntary alignment option so that if a patient \u00e2\u0080\u009copts-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d to an aco the next step would be selecting a primary clinician in the aco. this would then trigger the voluntary alignment beneficiary assignment methodology, allowing patients to select their provider of choice without requiring an unnecessary primary care visit from a primary care or specialty physician for the purposes of assignment. voluntary alignment (83 fr 41894) as we have stated earlier, we support your proposal to update the voluntary alignment methodology and remove 42 cfr \u00e2\u00a7 425.402(e)(2)(i) in its entirety. this would allow  beneficiaries to voluntarily align with an mssp aco by choosing an aco professional, such as an np, to be  responsible for coordinating their overall care. that beneficiary would then be assigned to the aco without having to receive at least one primary care service from a primary care physician who is an aco professional. consistent with the language in the bipartisan budget act of 2018, this would supersede any claims-based assignment methodology. this is an important step to increase the number of clinicians and beneficiaries participating in the mssp and reduce the utilization of unnecessary primary care visits conducted solely for beneficiary assignment. patients should have the authority to select their health care provider of choice, including nps. this proposal is consistent with that principle. we thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed regulation. we look forward to discussing these issues with you. should you have comments or questions, please direct them to maryanne sapio, v.p. federal

hospitals, practices and independent providers. the mssp aco program is an important model for rural america. most rural acos are a combination of independent practices, employed physicians, rural health clinics, federally qualified health centers, and the local rural and/or critical access hospitals. it is rare to find a rural aco that is comprised of only independent practices. the mssp is the only model that includes multiple aspects of the healthcare system, as opposed to other value-based models that only pertain to a single practice or organization (i.e., cpc+, bpci, etc.). the mssp provides the legal framework to allow rural hospitals and providers to discuss cost and create care initiatives for the entire community while still maintaining their independence.\nmany rural aco participants are working to decrease costs on lower than average benchmarks and smaller attributed patient populations. it is very difficult to achieve savings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 let alone shared savings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with the high msr smaller acos are assigned. the sicker populations and lower benchmarks mean an increased potential for extreme variability in performance year over year. one or two beneficiaries ending up in the emergency department may mean the difference between savings and losses for a rural aco and its participants.\nthe variability of the mssp \u00e2\u0080\u0093 made more variable by the proposed changes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 makes it unrealistic for rural hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural health clinics, federally qualified health centers and independent practices to continue participating in this program. the current proposals will create a rural-urban divide in risk-based contract participation. as currently proposed, only urban hospitals and systems will have the financial reserves to assume the proposed levels of risk.\nhospital board members, especially rural hospital board members, will never approve any level of risk tied to the proposed degree of variability, particularly when tied to a decreased share in savings. rural hospitals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and by extension the rural independent practices they support \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are unable and unwilling to assume the proposed levels of risk. cms must alter the proposed changes to provide opportunity for rural hospitals to participate in the mssp without risking the financial viability of their organization.\n\u0007\n\ncms committed to bringing \u00e2\u0080\u009ca rural healthcare focus to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 healthcare delivery and payment reform initiatives\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the rural health strategy published in early 2018. this commitment is missing from the proposed rule. rural is mentioned throughout the document but there is no discussion of a rural-specific focus on participation criteria.\nrural aco participants need access to a upside only or one-sided track in the mssp. the current track 1 is the only viable opportunity for rural acos to participate in a medicare value-based model. there are other options, but the mssp aco remains the only option for independent rural healthcare organizations to work together to address the cost and quality of care.  even with this model, the potential for earning enough shared savings to build sustainable cash reserves for taking risk is non-existent.\ncms must develop exclusions specific to rural acos:\nexclusion from the proposed basic glide path and enhanced track;\nexclusion from proposed schedule for moving between basic and enhanced; and,\nexclusion from high and low revenue designations.\ncms must define rural acos as:\naco shall not include a hospital as an aco participant or aco provider/supplier unless the hospital is an inpatient prospective payment system (ipps) hospital with fewer than 100 beds or a critical access hospital (cah); and,\n75% or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants are located in counties designated as rural or frontier. o this definition uses the same methodology as the aco investment model.\ncms must provide the following opportunities for rural acos:\n50% share of savings.\nbasic rural: upside-only for two 5-year agreement terms with aggregate show of savings and quality attainment at the end of each agreement period.\nenhanced rural: option to move to a graduated risk model when financially ready. rural acos taking on risk would have three years at proposed basic level c then a year each in proposed basic levels d and e. the share in savings would be set at 50% for each year of the agreement term.\nhigh revenue definition & percentage threshold\nwhen considering the high revenue and low revenue definitions, cms failed to account for three things:\nthe fixed cost of doing business is higher in rural areas than in urban areas;\nrural hospitals have demonstrably smaller net operating profit margins than urban hospitals; and,\nany sort of revenue threshold must consider fixed cost and operating margin.\nthe proposed high revenue and low revenue definitions fail to account for the low net operating profit margins of rural hospitals. as figure 2 below illustrates, the national average net operating profit margin of urban hospitals in the country is 4.71% while the national average for rural hospitals is -10.63%. the proposed rule suggests a revenue to expenses ratio of 25% as the determining factor between high and low revenue aco participants. a rural hospital may have a revenue to expenses ratio that places it above 25% yet the hospitals margin is negative and therefore signifies a lack of cash reserves to cover any losses. the colorado rural hospitals participating in acos have an average net operating profit margin of -16.56%. these hospitals are participating in two acos with quality scores above 94%. the two track 1 acos have generated over $6 million in savings to cms and have yet to achieve shared savings. despite their performance, the hospitals clearly lack the working capital to cover the level of risk proposed in the basic glide path.\ncms should consider the fixed cost ratio and set the revenue amount at a realistic level. it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s irrational to assume an organization making less than $500 million in total revenue could accept the proposed levels of risk, even in the basic glide path. the fixed costs of doing business are too high and the operating margins are too low in rural areas; there is no cash reserve to cover the potential losses. the fixed cost doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change at the same rate for a rural hospital compared to an urban hospital. the percentage of fixed cost of a high revenue organization is less than the percentage of fixed cost in a low revenue organization (i.e., the operating margin provides fewer cash resources to work with).\nthe proposed high revenue definition assumes cash fluidity is equal between urban and rural hospitals. the fixed cost of doing business is substantially higher in rural counties than it is in urban counties. the proposed rule recognizes this very situation:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ca lower threshold could categorize acos with more moderate revenue as high revenue, for example because of the presence of multi-specialty physician practices or certain rural or safety net providers/suppliers (such as cahs, fqhcs and rhcs). categorizing these moderate revenue acos as high revenue, could require acos that have a smaller degree of control over the expenditures of their assigned beneficiaries, and acos that are not as adequately capitalized, to participate in a level of performance-based risk that the aco would not be prepared to manage\u00e2\u0080\u009d (page 108).\nincreasing the threshold to the alternatively proposed 30% would fail to adequately categorize these moderate revenue acos as low revenue acos. as evidenced in figure 3 below, the three rural acos all fail to meet the low revenue designation. aco a is comprised of critical access hospitals, rural health clinics, an fqhc and an independent practice. aco b is comprised of multiple independent practices, critical access hospitals, rural demonstration hospitals, and fqhcs. aco c is comprised of critical access hospitals, demonstration hospitals, fqhcs, rhcs, and independent practices. these three acos are representative of rural acos. the revenue and expense amounts are likewise representative of rural acos.\nthe proposed rule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current revenue threshold (25%) ensures low revenue acos would be physician-led, yet it is unlikely to see physician-led acos in rural areas. rural acos will be incorrectly deemed high revenue, as a result of the proposed 25% threshold. cms must exempt rural acos from the revenue designation or cms must ensure rural acos are considered low revenue by altering the threshold to 60%.\nshared savings percentage\ndecreasing the share in savings in the basic glide path disincentivizes participation in the mssp. the basic glide path requires participants to assume risk yet realize a smaller share in savings than previously available. as proposed, the basic glide path fails to adequately incentivize acos to accept downside risk by decreasing of share of savings the first four years of the agreement term (levels a-d). the majority of track 1 acos are new to the program (2016 starters) and are still risk-averse.\nthe proposed decrease in share of savings will further drive acos from the mssp and particularly rural acos. rural participants feel the proposed levels of risk far outweigh the share of savings, especially given the decreased share to 25%. cms must increase the level of first dollar shared savings rate to 50% for rural acos and low revenue acos.\nsuggested language\nrural acos will be allowed a sharing rate of 50%.\nbeneficiary risk score cap\nthe proposed change to the risk adjustment fails to distinguish between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries. the proposed cap of +/-3% would apply to both new and continuously assigned beneficiaries and would hold for the entire 5-year agreement period. while the risk score adjustment is limited to 3%, maintaining or improving appropriate documentation may be the difference between shared savings and shared losses for many acos.\nadditionally, populations shift throughout an agreement period and this model may not fully account for these changes due to the 3% risk score adjustment limit. as milliman points out in its white paper on the proposed rule, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith agreement periods now lasting five years, there is the potential for up to seven years of risk score adjustment from by1 to the last performance year (py5)\u00e2\u0080\u009d. since the proposed rule allows for cumulative adjustment from by3 to each performance year to be capped at 3%, any significant change in the population over the course of the agreement period may not be fully captured in the risk score adjustment. cms must update the risk adjustment methodology to allow risk scores to change by +/-5% over an agreement term.\nquality payment program interaction\nthe proposed rule only discusses potential impact on advanced apms. there is no discussion on how the proposed 6-month extension period will impact mips apm scoring. will track 1 acos be required to report twice if new participants are added for the july 1, 2019 performance year? if so, which aco score will be used for 2019 mips payment adjustment?\nit would be less burdensome to offer a 1-year extension period instead of 6-months to allow for a clean, 12-month performance period and to provide acos ample time to understand the final rule and plan accordingly.\nelimination of aco-11 metric\nwe support the decision to eliminate the aco-11, use of cehrt, metric. however, questions remain on how this will impact aspects of mips and the 2019 pfs proposed rule. basic level e is modeled after track 1+. it is assumed that 2015 cehrt will be required to meet the base requirements of level e participation. if aco-11 is removed, as proposed, will the 2015 cehrt requirement for 2019 likewise be removed? it is unclear how the mssp proposed rule interacts with the 2019 pfs proposed rule.\nvery few rural facilities currently utilize all 2015 cehrt. the cost to transition quickly is prohibitive. cms will need to develop a funding program to assist rural organizations with implementing 2015 cehrt if required to transition by 2019.\nbeneficiary opt-in assignment methodology\nthe proposed change to allow beneficiary opt-in completely misses the mark. requiring beneficiaries to decide to opt-in to an aco at the first primary care visit of each year adds time to the visit that should be spent discussing the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wellbeing and health. it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a burden to the practices to add yet another disclaimer to review with patients. the proposed rule fails to improve the beneficiary notification process, nor does it reduce administrative burden on practices. additionally, the mssp tried the opt-in approach before and removed the requirement in 2015 due to the increased burden it placed on practices. cms must remove this proposed change to the beneficiary assignment methodology.\nwashington rural health collaborative\nthe washington rural health collaborative represents fifteen, rural, critical access hospitals across the state of washington who are actively engaged in healthcare transformation.  our members are listed on page one of this comment document.  five of our members currently participate in the rocky mountain aco project being managed by the community care alliance.  those five hospitals, with additional members, are interested in creating a new aco when the 2019 application cycle opens.  their interest and ability to participate is dependent on the outcome of this rulemaking.  our cahs want to participate (and are participating at a higher rate), but they lack the cash flow to participate in risk. requiring a move to risk will cause an exodus of our rural hospitals and providers from the mssp.\n\n", "0350": "see attached file(s)\n october 16, 2018\n seema verma, administrator centers for medicare & medicaid services 7500 security blvd baltimore, md 21244\n re: medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success (cms-1701-p)\n dear administrator verma:\n aledade (\u00e2\u0080\u008bwww.aledade.com)\u00e2\u0080\u008b partners with 339 primary care physician practices, fqhcs and rhcs in value-based health care. organized into 20 accountable care organizations across 24 states, these primary care physicians are accountable for over 320,000 medicare beneficiaries. more than half of our primary care providers are in practices with fewer than 10 clinicians. we are committed to outcome-based approaches to determine the value of health care. we are committed to using technology, data, practice-transformation expertise and, most important, the relationship between a person and their primary care physician to improve the value of health care.\n we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to continue to align mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial incentives with value creation in medicare. better alignment means that savings accrue from unnecessary hospitalizations that were avoided, wasteful testing that was eliminated, uncontrolled diabetes that become managed, and better quality of life for medicare beneficiaries. poor alignment can leave savings up to chance, or worse, contingent upon stinting and cost shifting or other factors that do not positively affect the lives of medicare beneficiaries.  we offer our comments on increasing financial alignment and increasing participation in the medicare shared savings program (mssp) so that more medicare beneficiaries can receive the benefits of lower costs and higher quality that physician-led acos offer.\n by every measure, the mssp is saving medicare money and improving quality. today it is simply the most cost effective way to provide medicare benefits to the american people. yet performance among acos is uneven, and with the right policy environment, the potential for much greater cost savings and even better quality is within our grasp.\n varied markedly between low revenue acos and high revenue acos with \u00e2\u0080\u008blow revenue acos accounting for nearly all of the savings\u00e2\u0080\u008b to medicare. this finding is supported by \u00e2\u0080\u008brecent research\u00e2\u00a0 1 from harvard \u00e2\u0080\u008bthat found savings concentrated in acos composed solely of physicians, rather than those that include hospitals. we also compared mssp performance to the next generation\u00e2\u00a0 2 aco program and found that low revenue acos even outperformed next generation acos.\n it is this performance that should drive pathways to success. first, cms should encourage more low revenue aco participation. second, cms should increase financial alignment with value, particularly for high revenue acos. our comments all emanate from these two objectives, which will ultimately promote cost savings in ways that are good for patients, good for health care providers and good for society.\n $60 million in increased claims costs, and comes at a real cost to beneficiaries. cms should prefer reduced costs that represent fewer unnecessary hospitalizations, less waste in the system and healthier people. we encourage cms to set a goal for the final regulation to generate more savings from reduced costs than from reduced shared savings payments.\n the most direct way to further reduce medical costs is to increase low revenue aco participation. to achieve this, we suggest the following: \u00e2\u0097\u008f increase the proposed range of the shared savings rate in basic (a-e) from 25 - 50% to 40 - 60% to provide an adequate return on investment and to encourage more risk taking \u00e2\u0097\u008f reduce the minimum savings rate for low revenue acos to decrease uncertainty and provide early returns on investment to support the transition to risk \u00e2\u0097\u008f eliminate or, at minimum, increase the proposed cap on the regional benchmark to create long term stability and strong incentives for acos to achieve and, just as important, maintain a high level of regional efficiency \u00e2\u0097\u008f finalize the proposal to allow acos to choose retrospective or prospective assignment so that acos can match their interventions to their preferred assignment methodology we offer greater detail on each suggestion later in this letter.\n greater financial alignment with value creation can also generate more cost savings. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals greatly increase financial alignment. to increase it even further, we suggest the following: \u00e2\u0097\u008f remove the aco assigned beneficiaries from the regional benchmark and regional trend because their inclusion disadvantages rural acos, and the \u00e2\u0080\u009csmall numbers problem\u00e2\u0080\u009d can be easily addressed as other cms programs demonstrate \u00e2\u0097\u008f do not finalize the blended regional/national trend proposal; it does not address the problems created by the inclusion of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries in regional trends and it creates uncertainty for the acos \u00e2\u0097\u008f increase the cap on changes in risk score from +/- 3% to +/- 5% to focus only on outliers and to remove any incentive for acos to avoid risky beneficiaries \u00e2\u0097\u008f increase the final regional benchmark percentage to 70% from the proposed 50% to create long-term stability in the program and move to a structure more similar to medicare advantage \u00e2\u0097\u008f finalize the proposed glide paths to two-sided risk \u00e2\u0097\u008f finalize the ability to transition to higher levels of risk as soon as the aco is ready \u00e2\u0097\u008f shorten the time frames for surety bonds to reduce the costs of going to risk without compromising the financial guarantees to cms \u00e2\u0097\u008f do not increase the administrative burden on acos with either disproven or unproven beneficiary notification methods we offer greater detail on each suggestion later in the letter.\n we look forward to working with cms to increase the savings to medicare through pathways to success, and ultimately deliver better medicare experience for beneficiaires. increasing aco participation cms enjoys a remarkable return on its investment in mssp; track 1 low revenue acos generated savings to medicare of $73 per beneficiary against benchmark in 2016 and those savings appear to be growing each year. each additional low revenue aco that joins the mssp represents future savings and better care for medicare beneficiaries. but for an aco to join pathways to success, a reasonable return on investment to the aco must also be attainable. in order to determine a rate of return to the aco, assumptions on the investment must be made.\n to calculate the type of return an aco needs to achieve, we look at cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 own estimates of what it costs to run an aco from the aim and cpc+ models.  for a 10,000-person aco, aim makes a $1,570,000 investment in the first year and a $960,000 investment in the second year, totaling $2,530,000. for a 10,000-person practice, cpc+ track 2 makes a recurring annual investment of $3,360,000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 considerably more than the aim. the average benchmark for an mssp aco in 2017 was $10,554 making the total spend for this same 10,000 person aco $105,540,000. for aim, this represents an investment of 1.5% of the total cost of care in the first year. for cpc+, the investment is a whopping 3.2% of total cost of care every year. it is against these investments that cms should consider appropriate shared savings rates and other policies in order for pathways of success to succeed. increase the proposed basic shared savings rate we cannot recommend that cms finalize its proposal to reduce the shared savings rate from 50% to 25% for one-sided risk. while we support the principle of rising share rates with rising risk,  a 25% share rate is simply inadequate to support the investments an aco makes. we recommend that cms use 40%\u00e2\u0080\u009360% as the range for basic (a-e) because this will justify the requisite aco investments and encourage acos to take on more risk.\n\n\n basic\u00e2\u00a0 level a\u00e2\u00a0 level b\u00e2\u00a0 level c\u00e2\u00a0 level d\u00e2\u00a0 level e nprm\u00e2\u00a0 25%\u00e2\u00a0 25%\u00e2\u00a0 30%\u00e2\u00a0 40%\u00e2\u00a0 50% aledade recommendation\u00e2\u00a0 40%\u00e2\u00a0 40%\u00e2\u00a0 50%\u00e2\u00a0 55%\u00e2\u00a0 60%\n by encouraging greater participation in pathways to success, cms would be making its own investment in future savings that will more than offset the greater shared savings payments under our recommendation. lower the minimum shared savings rate for low revenue acos we support encouraging low revenue aco participation by offering a lower msr. as discussed in the previous section, even at higher levels of sharing rates, the first few years of population health are unlikely to generate savings against a historical benchmark that are sufficient for an early return. as acos begin to generate savings and shift the cost variation curve to the right it becomes more likely that they will cross the msr, but not guaranteed until later years. this makes it difficult for low revenue acos to achieve sufficient returns to bear risk with adequate reserves. we recommend that cms lower the msr for low revenue acos in basic level a and level b by 2% from the current msr. for example, a 10,000 person aco has a current msr of 3%; under this recommendation it would be 1%.\n this proposal would make it much more likely for low revenue acos to see early returns on their investments, which would support earlier transitions to risk and prevent acos from dropping out of the program. although we understand  cms is concerned about acos that do not make investments and still receive savings payments, we believe several forces mitigate this possibility. first, low revenue acos generate net savings to medicare even in track 1. second, the availability of the lower msr is time limited to two years under the proposed basic track. third, as shown in the analysis that accompanied the nprm, savings against benchmark underrepresents the total savings to medicare. cms still retains 100% of the savings not reflected in benchmark performance regardless of msr. according to the analysis in the regulation, a low revenue aco with 10,000 medicare beneficiaries would have saved medicare $730,000 in 2016. cms simply can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford not to have more low revenue acos. we believe that the performance of existing acos will continue to improve, but if we ever hope to turn 2016\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $6 billion in savings into $60 billion, we will need considerably more acos. creating a more predictable, reasonable return on investment will spur the private investment needed to make this happen.\n designation from 25% to 15%. we note that the actuaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 impact analysis used the even lower 10% to draw the distinction. alternatively, cms could continue the track 1+ policy of requiring ownership attestations from aco participants. apply regional adjustment earlier but remove the proposed cap we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to apply a regional adjustment in the first contract period, but we do not recommend that cms finalize its proposal to cap the regional benchmarking adjustment. at a modest 25% or 35%, this adjustment provides a duly-earned incentive for efficient practices in their first contract period, without discouraging less efficient providers to enter an aco and improve. it also provides predictability and simplicity for acos as they seek to understand the nuances of the regulatory environment.  finally, it accelerates the process of making mssp more like medicare advantage, which is a cms goal that we support.  however, we are concerned about the 5% cap on the regional adjustment, and we propose eliminating it while cms gains more experience with pathways to success. if cms does not eliminate the cap, we recommend increasing it to 8% and applying it at the aggregate level not the eligibility category level, which is an efficiency return similar to what medicare advantage plans can receive net of their administrative costs for administering the plan (~7%).\n we understand cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concern about allowing large windfalls for regionally efficient practices, but such a cap should capture only true outliers, which would suggest a cap greater than 5%. in considering a cap, it is imperative to consider the inherent policy tradeoff, and we believe that cms is overly concerned with biased aco selection, in which aco participants skew heavily towards already efficient providers. there are several reasons why this should be less of a concern, and why increasing the cap to 8% at the aggregate level strikes a better policy balance. first, even if acos were able to identify such practices using historical data and to sign up a portion of those practices, such efficiency is likely to revert to the mean, including during the gap between when data is available, and when the performance period starts. furthermore, by capping the regional adjustment of an aco at 5%, cms is reducing the incentive for the practices within an aco to continue to improve. such a policy would create essentially a 100% tax rate that sends the wrong behavioral message to acos, to rest on their laurels. this is especially true if cms applies the cap at the individual eligibility category level. if an aco were to cap out on esrd patients or dually eligible patients, the aco would be incentivized to no longer improve on those patients even though much more may still be done for them. it is extremely difficult to achieve regional efficiency, and even more difficult to sustain it. medicare should not implement policies that penalize physicians for further improving on high-quality, cost-efficient care.  finally, just as in medicare advantage, a dynamic free market, profits will allow providers that have achieved and sustained ever higher levels of patient care and efficiency to expand their practices and attract greater number of patients, which is beneficial to both patients and taxpayers.\n\n the table below demonstrates the effects of this policy on acos. in our example, we have an aco with a historical benchmark of $9,000 in a region where all the beneficiaries outside the aco have average annual expenses of $10,000. for simplicity, risk is held constant; hence, beneficiaries in the aco cost $1,000 less per person, risk adjusted, than the beneficiaries outside of the aco. we also assume that the aco reduces costs by 5% in the performance year, from $9,000 to $8,550, generating $450 in historical savings. assuming a regional bonus of 35% of the regional benchmark difference, the combined regional savings and historical savings of this aco is $800 per person ($1,000 x 35% + $450). yet, as the table illustrates, if the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficiaries are included in the regional comparisons cms starts to capture 100% of those savings at a rate that increases in direct proportion to market share.\n effects of including aco beneficiaries in regional benchmark - risk scores held flat regional efficiency $1,000.00 aco per capita by3 $9,000.00 market per capita by3 $10,000.00 historical

the entire county is not in the hrr. failure to address this easily solvable problem unjustifiably disadvantages rural acos and thereby discourages their participation.\n we recognize that our proposal, which would necessitate county benchmarks unique to every aco, may be burdensome for cms if the underlying infrastructure is not flexible. while not as precise, cms could apply a mathematical adjustment to the existing regional calculations to simplify the process. the regional efficiency (regional benchmark compared to aco benchmark) and regional trend could be multiplied by 1 divided by (1-aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market share).\n true regional trend = (regional trend including aco beneficiaries) x (1/(1-aco market share)) true regional efficiency = (regional risk adjusted costs including aco beneficiaries - aco risk adjusted costs) x (1/(1-aco market share))\n because this adjustment would be a less accurate measure of the regional trend and regional benchmarks, we would encourage cms to consider using assignable, rather than assigned, beneficiaries in calculating the adjustment, in order to capture spillover effects. we note that this does not directly address the small number problems and that expansion to hrr may still be warranted in some cases. overall, we encourage cms to calculate cms regional benchmarks and regional trends without the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficiaries; however, if the burden is too high, we believe that this adjustment methodology is better policy than both the current inclusion of the aco beneficiaries and cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed blending of the regional and national trends.\n solve the problems created by inclusion of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficiaries in regional trend, which moves savings out of rural areas and into urban areas. use regional trends as the most accurate measure of value we cannot recommend that cms finalize its proposal to blend regional and national trends based on aco market share. we support the use of regional trends in all years. cms gave two reasons for the blended trend rate. first, it was billed as a partial solution to the ill-advised inclusion of aco beneficiaries in regional benchmark and regional trend. as discussed previously, it is a rare case in which the blend accomplishes its goal and, in those cases, it is merely by chance. this simply does not work and should not be the basis of a finalized cms policy. second, by including national inflation, cms has yet again decided to reward low-trend regions and to penalize those areas with high trends. the original statute enacting mssp, as well as the first regulation for mssp, also sought to use national trends to similarly sacrifice direct measures of value creation, in favor of other policy ends. the flaw has always been that it measures acos based on uncontrollable factors: an individual aco is not responsible for whether its area is high cost or low cost, and it is often not responsible for cost changes in the region.\n the combination of these two policies has created a great deal of uncertainty in acos. for example, in the first performance year of one of aledade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acos, a new rehabilitation hospital opened early in the year. this increased rehab costs by ~1% of the total cost of care, creating a permanent headwind for the aco. in another rural aledade aco, patients began receiving adequate access to certain part b drugs, which increased part b drug expenditures by 27%. this regional development was excellent for medicare beneficiaries, but made it virtually impossible for the aco to generate savings. unobservable on national trends, both examples had profound effects in the region. further, non-medical examples abound such as when hurricanes or other natural disasters impact any area, the regional trend justifiably deviates from national cost growth. cms should move away from national trends because they confound the measurement of results that are controlled by and attributable to the providers in an aco. improving utilization of risk adjustment we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to eliminate the the distinction between newly and continuously assigned patients and apply the hcc scores of the assigned population to adjust the benchmark. this simplifies the risk adjustment methodology, aligns it with value generation for greater predictability, and makes the mssp operate more like medicare advantage.\n meaningfully harm aco performance. the disadvantage of asymmetric risk adjustment for continuously assigned patients is mitigated, in part, by allowing the newly assigned population to receive symmetric changes in risk scores. but the effect is minimal, and the bifurcation of the aco population (newly and continuously assigned) introduces complexity and unpredictability. as such, we support the elimination of this distinction, coupled with a symmetric risk adjustment model.\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to adjust benchmarks based on risk, in order to decrease actuarial risk, particularly for smaller physician-only acos. we are also sensitive to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerns about gaming, and we thus support a risk adjustment cap. however, such a cap ought to be set as an outlier policy that prevents excessive upcoding. if cms retains a cap, not only should it be raised, but cms should also apply the cap at the aggregate level of the aco, not the individual eligibility categories (esrd, disabled, dual, aged/non-dual), and cms should consider overall aco size when choosing an appropriate cap.\n there are other reasons besides focusing on outliers to increase the size of the cap. if the cap is set too low, cms is incentivizing \u00e2\u0080\u009ccherry picking\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009clemon dropping,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wherein providers face strong incentives to select healthy patients and avoid the sickest patients, once the contract period begins. we believe that the proposed 3% cap should be raised to 5%, in order to avoid these perverse incentives. indeed, in the proposed rule, cms reviewed trends in hcc risk scores in the mssp and states that \u00e2\u0080\u009ca 3% cap...would limit positive risk adjustment for less than 30% of acos, even when there is a 5-year lapse between by3 and the performance year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d thirty percent is far too great of a proportion to harm in this way, and it will unjustifiably penalize acos who care for a population whose risk increases over the course of the contract period. we encourage cms to re-run its analysis to determine a cap that would hinder 10% or less of acos. we hypothesize that a +/- 5% cap at the aggregate level of the aco would be sufficient. as alluded to above, it is critical that the cap is applied at the aggregate level because some categories have much smaller populations and therefore will vary naturally more than the aggregate aco population; this methodology will ensure that the risk adjustment cap is an outlier policy that discourages lemon dropping. further, we encourage cms to consider whether the cap should vary by aco size, considering that, for example, a 5,000 assigned beneficiary aco will have more variation than a 50,000 assigned beneficiary aco.\n\n policy, and thereby allowing accurate and comprehensive diagnostic communication of risk for acos, cms will begin to create more equivalence between ma and ffs. increase regional benchmark percentage to 70% as we noted in our comments addressing the regional adjustment cap, we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a regional component of the benchmark in the first contract period. we agree that the initial regional benchmark percentage should be set at 25%/35%, but this percentage should be increased to 70% in subsequent contract periods, rather than capped at the proposed 50%. it is worth emphasizing that cms has proposed not only to reduce the regional benchmark percentage to 50%, but also to impose a cap of 5% on the regional adjustment. we understand cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impetus for these proposals, but it is a substantial over-correction \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and it creates a new set of ill-advised incentives that reduce the long-term viability of cost-efficient acos. we recommended eliminating the cap. alternatively, we recommended an 8% cap tied to regional efficiency gains that can be expected in medicare advantage. if cms does finalize a cap, we believe it is redundant to also lower the percentage from 70% to 50%.\n acos are medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most efficient delivery system; the mssp saves money relative to ffs and ma, and it performs better on quality metrics. given that ma benchmarks are effectively calculated with a 100% regional component (no historial factor), cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal of 50% regional adjustment for acos is a regression from the goal of ma-mssp harmonization; it would codify a substantial divergence from ma and stymie cost-effective acos that wish to become risk-bearing acos. a 70% regional factor for second-contract acos justifiably aligns these risk-bearing providers with medicare advantage.\n participants to switch acos on the july 2019 start date, even if the aco participant is in an aco with an existing aco agreement that runs past july 2019. allow acos to transition to risk faster we support the proposal for five year contracts, but only if acos can more quickly move to risk within basic and can move to enhanced in any performance year. cms should not prevent acos from moving to risk as soon as they are ready to do so.  while a clear minimum glidepath advances the goals of risk bearing without deterring participation , the ability to assume risk more quickly is equally crucial for acos that are ready. if cms wants to maximize aco risk taking, this policy is key. shorten the time frame for maturity of surety bonds we cannot recommend that cms lengthen the time frame of the repayment mechanism from 5 years to 7 years. we suggest that cms institute a 3 year repayment mechanism that is renewed annually. these recommendation are based on our experience securing surety bonds for risk taking acos.\n in 2018, three aledade acos entered into two-sided risk contracts under the current medicare shared savings program.  of these three acos, two participate in the \u00e2\u0080\u009chigher reward \u00e2\u0080\u0093 higher risk\u00e2\u0080\u009d track 3 contract (representing 50% of all 2018 entrants into track 3). we secured surety bonds to meet the 1% requirement for the track 3 acos. we look forward to bringing many more of our acos into two-sided risk; however, the cost is already substantial.\n under the proposed rule, all acos will be required to take two-sided risk within three years. as a prerequisite to take on two-sided risk, acos must demonstrate their ability to repay shared losses by setting up repayment mechanisms.  the repayment mechanisms can be (1) cash in an escrow account, (2) surety bond, or (3) letter of credit from a bank.\n the repayment mechanism amount required is significant and can range from $100,000 for an aco with 5,000 assigned beneficiaries under the basic track, to $5,000,000 for an aco with 50,000 assigned beneficiaries under the enhanced track. the proposed 7-year term required for repayment mechanisms raises the cost much more than simply adding two years would suggest.\n surety bonds or letters of credit can reduce the liquidity burden of the repayment mechanism, as they allow for lower cash collateral.  however,  the requirement to maintain a 7-year term severely limits the availability and attractiveness of surety bonds as an alternative to posting cash in escrow which limits the ability of an aco to invest in savings.\n\n aledade has brought cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to the attention of one beacon surety group, philadelphia insurance, liberty mutual and swiss re. after discussion and analysis both organizations came to the conclusion that if the proposed  7-year term is finalized, all surety bonds would require the full 100% collateral. this would impose a significant liquidity and capital burden, limiting a aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to invest in innovations that deliver higher quality care at lower cost.  this would be especially problematic for physician-based and small, rural acos, neither of which have access to low-cost capital.\n as noted in the proposed rule, the 7-year term would also introduce challenges regarding repayment mechanism amount estimations at the start of each performance year, as well as changes to the estimated amount upon contract renewal with term extensions.  while the proposed rule attempts to allow acos to re-use existing repayment mechanisms, in practice these repayment mechanisms (other than escrowed cash) will be re-underwritten and reissued on an annual basis.\n avoid beneficiary opt-in requirements for shared savings programs we believe that requiring opt-in of all acos in the pathways to success program would end participation in the pathways to success program. the shared savings economic model simply does not support the type of investments that medicare advantage makes in an opt-in model. cms would undoubtedly lose the cost savings demonstrated by acos in 2016 and 2017 and certainly would have no chance of greatly increasing those savings in future year. as hypothesized by cms in the proposed rule, enrollment in pathways to success would fall dramatically and cms would have to implement a much higher shared savings rate in order to support the large aco investments that enrollment would require.\n cms also discusses the possibility of acos opting in to an enrollment model. we believe that anytime a beneficiary is subject to a restriction in providers or a less generous benefit than in traditional medicare, the beneficiary should choose to enroll in a model. cms is not currently proposing to offer acos either ability in the pathways to success program. if cms were in the future to offer these options in pathways to success or in another model, we would encourage cms to revisit enrollment as an option for acos wishing to include more advanced benefit design in their aco work.\n we look forward to continuing to work with cms to incentivize more value creation in health care. please contact me or travis broome (travis@aledade.com) if you have any questions about our submission and/or if we can

organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success\n page 2 of 7\n allows acos in the basic track to move to progressively higher risk options within the agreement period. while we are supportive of this basic framework, we are very concerned about the shortened period for new acos to move from upside-only to taking on downside financial risk. the proposed rule would restrict this period from 6 to only 2 years. we are concerned that this policy will discourage the participation of new acos. while we agree that taking on financial risk is an important incentive for hospitals and clinicians to provide more efficient care, it must be a balanced approach that allows for operational changes to take place over time. research has shown that it typically takes more than 2 years for acos to make the clinical and operational changes to successfully prepare for financial risk, and this has borne out in providence st. joseph health\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own experience in the mssp. based on our experience at covenant health\u00e2\u0080\u0099s track 3 aco, we believe that it takes 3-5 years of very diligent work in order for an organization to even have the basic understanding of how the program works, develop the necessary infrastructure, and change provider behavior to impact spending. our track 1 aco finally achieved savings in its fourth year of participation. a recent study published in the new england journal of medicine suggests that shared-savings contracts that do not impose a downside risk of financial losses for spending above benchmarks are effective in lowering medicare spending. the study found that the aggregate reduction in fee-for-service spending accrued by these physician group acos was actually 39 percent greater than the amount reported by\ncms. study authors estimate net savings to medicare from these acos was nearly 2.8 times greater \n than cms reported.1 therefore, the mssp current policies around risk are producing medicare savings and we are concerned that shortening the timeframe for upside-risk may only cause smaller acos, without sufficient reserves to withstand potential losses, to leave the program. cms proposes to allow inexperienced re-entering and renewing accountable care organizations (acos), including those that are currently participating in track 1 of the mssp, an additional year of upside-only risk. providence st. joseph health urges cms to go even farther, and allow both new, as well as re- entering and renewing, inexperienced acos three years in upside-only risk, rather than the proposed one or two. we are also very concerned about the reduction of the gainsharing arrangement from 50 percent of savings to 25 percent of savings for the aco participating in an upside-only risk arrangement. this results in a substantial decrease in revenue to an organization that needs capital to invest in information technology and other infrastructure improvements, as well as care coordination activities to make the mssp successful. under the proposed rule, an aco would be barely in a position to understand the complexities of the mssp before the required move to downside risk. we are greatly concerned that requiring downside risk after only two years of participation in the mssp, while also reducing the amount of money rewarded to an aco from 50 percent of shared savings to 25 percent of shared savings, will result in a significant decrease in the number of organizations interested in participating in the mssp. providence st. joseph health encourages cms to increase shared savings in its basic track level a and b to 50 percent, at a minimum, for inexperienced new entrants given significant infrastructure investments a new aco has to make in the early years; level c to 40 percent; level d to\n page 3 of 7\n page 4 of 7\n page 5 of 7\n page 6 of 7\n alternative beneficiary assignment methodology (opt in) cms proposes an alternative beneficiary assignment methodology under which a beneficiary can opt in to the aco, and the agency seeks input on whether the program should be voluntary or mandatory. given the robust changes proposed in this rule, providence st. joseph health urges cms to wait before adding an additional beneficiary assignment methodology. this policy will place additional administrative and technical burdens on acos in order to track attributed patients and report them to\ncms. even if the methodology is voluntary, it will pose challenges given that acos will be using multiple \n page 7 of 7\n\n remove distinction between new and continuously-assigned beneficiaries, and cap cms-hcc risk adjustment to +/- 3 percent cms proposes to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries. the agency would use full cms-hcc risk adjustment for all assigned beneficiaries between the benchmark period and the performance year, subject to a symmetrical cap of positive or negative three percent for the agreement period, which would apply such that the adjustment between by3 and any performance year in the agreement period would never be more than 3 percent in either direction. providence st. joseph health strongly believes a three percent cap is not high enough, especially for a five year agreement period and we urge cms to permit meaningful increases in beneficiary risk scores over time. we urge cms to implement a higher cap\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as 5 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094that allows for year over year increases, and is not applied over the entire length of the agreement period.\n

\n\n", "0353": "attached are comments on behalf of unitedhealth group.\n\n unitedhealth group comments medicare program: medicare shared savings program \u00e2\u0080\u0093 accountable care organizations pathway to success\n unitedhealth group (uhg) is responding to a proposed rule that will initiate changes to the medicare shared savings program (mssp) standards for accountable care organizations (acos).  the proposed rule was published by the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) in the federal register on august 17, 2018 (83 fed. reg. 41786).  uhg applauds cms and its work to make its aco programs better by creating quality and value-based care models that tie the achievement of better care delivery to payment.\n cms demonstrates in the proposed rule that the availability of a lower-risk, two-sided model is an effective way to rapidly progress acos to performance-based risk.  the proposed redesign of the mssp has the potential to put the program on a path towards achieving a more measureable transition to health care value, demonstrate savings to the medicare program, and promote a competitive and accountable marketplace.  set out below is an overview of uhg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to value based care which we believe can help inform potential changes to the mssp standards for acos.\n moving to value in care delivery\n uhg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value based care (vbc) model creates a more financially sustainable health care system.  the key emphasis of vbc is on total cost of care, which creates accountability across the entire health care system with every health professional and facility supporting a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care, and points us to the best action to take for the patient and the physician.  this model stresses accountability for all involved through a focus on collaboration rather than volume and outcomes rather than outputs; and we address missed care opportunities rather than overlooking them.  when all of these components come together; we see clear improvement in the health of the people we serve.\n currently, the majority of health care providers are rewarded primarily on volume for more tests and procedures, rather than for coordinating with each other to produce better health outcomes for the entire patient population.  uhg wants to change that approach and promote better care, better health, lower costs, and an improved provider experience.\n we believe these goals can be accomplished using economic incentives, reducing administrative burdens, making it easier to share data, and by supporting peer learning communities where quality improvement efforts are done in collaboration with clinicians.   uhg recommends that any direct provider contracting model, similar to our approach to vbc, should encompass three key priorities:\n\n1. increasing utilization of alternative payment methodologies. \n\n2. reducing administrative and regulatory burdens on providers to support delivery of coordinated \n quality care.\n3. driving more efficient and timely sharing of data among, and for the benefit, of all stakeholders \n \u00e2\u0080\u0093 cms, payers, providers and patients.\n\n uhg is advancing a vbc model that impacts over 15 million consumers by partnering with more than 1,100 hospitals and 110,000 physicians with an emphasis on the total cost of care for a population.  key elements of success for this model include:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 keeping beneficiaries at the center of the health care system empowered with more information and support care delivery. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 emphasizing proactive, preventive care and keeping people healthy through care coordination. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 empowering providers via new technology, data, and financial incentives to coordinate care through information sharing.  data is available to identify patient health risks, improve care coordination, and enhance efficiency costs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 ensuring care providers are paid based on value generated, such as clinical quality, patient health improvements, and reducing per capita health care costs or total cost of care.\n detailed below are uhg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recommendations and best practices for how to implement direct provider contracting by leveraging uhg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best practices in vbc.\n \u00ef\u0083\u00bc reward beneficiaries for choosing high-performing physicians by offering financial incentives to motivate beneficiaries that choose high-performing, vbc providers. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc help beneficiaries find the highest value provider and site of service to ensure they receive high quality care and save money. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc provide innovative and consumer friendly technologies allowing beneficiaries to compare health care prices and quality ratings for doctors and hospitals. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc encourage beneficiaries to stay well through the use of virtual platforms. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc offer providers technology, timely patient data, and financial rewards to help them take better care of patients, to compare their performance to other physicians in the community and their peers, to evaluate costs of care through an episode of care, and to make a smooth transition to\nvbc. \n \u00ef\u0083\u00bc work with providers to reduce the administrative burdens and costs for managing care provided to beneficiaries.  this approach includes efforts to reduce prior authorization process challenges and enhanced sharing of electronic data to minimize time burdens and rework. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc engage providers in the development of measures used in our vbc model and create peer learning communities where provider organizations can learn from each other.  this type of approach is highly rewarding for care providers and effective in improving the quality of care medicare beneficiaries. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc seek to build trusting collaboration with providers resulting in communications, approvals, and patient follow-up are done with providers rather than to providers. \u00ef\u0083\u00bc work with providers and beneficiaries to ensure that every step along the care continuum is coordinated with a primary care provider, provides appropriate care at the highest value site of service, uses evidence based practices, and improves the health of beneficiaries with lower costs.\n addressing the needs of acos in the medicare shared savings program\n as noted, uhg believes there are a number of important \u00e2\u0080\u009clessons learned\u00e2\u0080\u009d from our vbc initiatives that can be applied to acos participating in medicare care delivery.  uhg emphasizes the following critical points with aco partners, which focus on value:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 improving high-risk patient care. a practice must be able to identify its most at-risk patients and help them get care. uhg works with providers and provides them data to accomplish this. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 expanding access to care. from extended hours and same day appointments to redirecting care, acos must help patients get convenient, timely care. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 improved care coordination can be enhanced through multi-disciplinary care teams lead by the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary care physician and that include case managers, pharmacists, behavioral health clinicians, and community health workers where appropriate. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 reducing avoidable readmissions and emergency room use. getting daily discharge data lets doctors better manage care transitions and follow-up care. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 identifying and closing missed care opportunities.  when payers and providers share data, they can see across a patient population, making it easier to identify risk and care gaps. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 improving patient satisfaction.  data from a payer can help providers more proactively engage with their patients to create a better health care experience.\n in the context of the proposed rule, we believe these points can be supplemented by defining the key foundational elements for the success of direct provider contracting models generally.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 direct contracting providers should be required to meet minimum standards for size and capability in order to be effective \u00e2\u0080\u0093 certain direct provider contracting models will not be effective with individual or small group providers.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 convening organizations may not be necessary, but the parameters for a direct provider contracting model should allow for both scenarios \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with and without a convening organization.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the defined qualifications and capabilities should be similar to those required for the aco or comprehensive primary care plus models, but allow flexibility in meeting those qualifications and capabilities to support innovative approaches and reduce administrative and regulatory burdens.  we would note that participants in existing models such as the next generation aco program or mssp should not be precluded from also participating in a direct provider contracting models.\n moving acos to accept additional risk\n the proposed rule introduces significant changes to the mssp in an effort to promote aco structures to accept down-side risk. uhg supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall goal as outlined in the proposed rule transitioning acos to performance-based risk payment models.  based on our experience, health care providers are most comfortable in upside risk-only arrangements and need additional incentives to move to an arrangement where the aco also accepts down-side risk.\n uhg is concerned, however, with the timeframe provided to new and renewing acos in upside only models to transition to new models as well as the introduction of new early termination policies based on spending increases outside a certain risk corridor.  we respectfully ask cms to consider a slower conversion to mandatory risk, allowing greater time for acos to prepare for the transition.\n accounting for the shared-savings payments earned by acos, mssp net savings reached $541.7 million in 2013\u00e2\u0080\u00932015 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not a loss of $344.2 million as estimated by cms.1  while we appreciate and understand the need to control costs to assist in extending the medicare trust fund, we are concerned with the conflicting data regarding the cost savings.\n another primary area of concern is with the financial monitoring and new early termination policies for acos based on spending increases outside a certain risk corridor.  any consideration of terminating an aco due to financial performance should offer an aco at least three years to develop the competencies needed for success.   in addition, cms should consider using a blended evaluation process, based on both spend outside the corridor and high cost utilization. finally, for acos that have achieved significant success in the past yet are struggling in current performance years, cms must offer support and credit in exchange for the significant savings the aco was responsible for and provide consideration for factors such as changes in the assignment methodology and risk adjustment of the population that provide challenges for those acos in any current performance year.\n elimination of aco mssp tracks\n uhg supports with certain modifications the proposed elimination of tracks 1 and 2 and creation of new basic and enhanced tracks as well as the lengthening of the agreement period to at least five years. because newer acos coming into the program need a minimum of three full years to prepare for risk, we propose that level a shared risk be at 50% with allowance to remain in track a for three years to allow for transition to risk.  the risk sharing rate of 25% is relatively low, does not provide sufficient allowance for transition to risk, and does not allow much flexibility.  in addition, the opt-out provision should be kept after the third year.  acos should have opportunity to exit the program if necessary infrastructure is not in place and they are not able to transition to risk quickly with the glide path.\n while we agree that the proposed five year agreement period helps the benchmark become more predictable, the plus/minus three percent does not allow sufficient adjustment and the cap should be set to zero.  cms should consider an approach using a normalization factor; allow full risk adjustment changes to the benchmark.\n in addition, under the proposed rule the first performance year for new aco would be scored on the first six months.  this is not an effective measure for a new aco, as they would not have the sufficient patient data.   this standard would have little effect for calendar year 2019.   a proposed solution would be to create a six month benchmark comparison that adjusts for seasonality.  as an alternative, cms could consider limiting new participants to a january 1, 2020 start date.\n development of basic and advanced tracks\n uhg supports with modifications making the enhanced track an advanced apm under requirements established by the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 (macra) as well as basic track e in that it is consistent with how the current tracks are scored in the merit based incentive payments system (mips).  however, we are aware that acos are at risk for deficits to their benchmarks.\n even no shared risk or only upside risk programs may be problematic due to a delayed repayment schedule given the significant investments by an aco.  as a result, cms should consider additional (c-d) tracks for advanced apm status in the future.  we are aware that the basic tracks are considered as mips apms (a-d levels) and there is a benefit in that cost is included in this model, which is helpful with respect to scoring.\n as noted, while we generally agree with the glide path approach outlined in the proposed rule, additional time may be needed to transition acos to a new risk model.  one to two years in a risk free glide path may not be enough time for certain acos to get ready to take on risk.  acos need time to develop programs that will continue to make them successful.   our concern is that while the glide path does get acos to shared risk and value based payments, what happens when an aco stops making efforts to reduce utilization?   low revenue acos struggle with cost and expenses and many low revenue acos see continued decline in their inpatient, emergency room, and skilled nursing facility utilization, yet still see the costs associated with the same areas of utilization increase), and the proposed glide path may discourage acos from providing cost effective care.\n determining participation based on revenue and prior participation\n the proposed rule establishes new criteria for aco participation based on fee for service revenue and prior program participation.  uhg supports the proposal of determining experienced and inexperienced acos using the methodology focusing on revenue levels and acceptance of risk.\n we also agree with that the definition of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeferred aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d should be clarified and easily determined by the aco to avoid confusion.  however, we believe the definition as set out in the proposed rule is not sufficient clear.  we suggest that a deferred aco should be an aco that extended its first agreement period by one year.  for example, an aco with a first agreement period beginning january 1, 2013 and ending december 31, 2015 would be considered a deferred aco if, at the end of the first term, the aco elected to extend its term for one year, from  january 1, 2016 to december 31, 2016, as allowed under 42 cfr \u00e2\u00a7425.200.  an aco that renewed its first  three year agreement period (i.e., january 1, 2013 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 december 31, 2015) for a second  three year agreement period (i.e., january 1, 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 december 31, 2018), would not be considered a deferred aco.\n track 1 time restrictions\n the proposed rule places time restrictions on acos under track 1 to be in the basic b track for six months and twelve months through 2020.  we agree with these limitations.\n monitoring financial performance\n uhg has concerns with the financial performance requirements in the proposed rule.  first, any consideration of terminating an aco due to financial performance should offer an aco at least three years to develop the competencies needed for success.  in addition, cms should consider a blended evaluation, based on spend outside the risk corridor as well as high cost utilization.  as stated previously, low revenue acos can demonstrate consistent reductions in utilization of high spend services, yet see the costs associated with that utilization increase.  these increased costs may be mitigated by removing the risk adjustment cap; however, a blended approach would still serve the interests of both acos and\ncms.  \n\n acos that demonstrate improvement in the areas of high cost utilization should not be penalized.  cms should be cautious about the potential ramifications of terminating acos that are demonstrating success in key areas of the program, even if that success does not translate to reductions in spend below the minimum savings rate, as removing them from the program will result expenditure increases for the populations managed by the aco.\n finally, for acos that have achieved significant success in the past yet are struggling in current performance years, cms must provide support and credit in exchange for the significant savings they were responsible for and consideration for factors such as changes in the assignment methodology and risk adjustment of the patient population.\n benchmarking methodology refinements\n the proposed rule modifies the mssp risk adjustment methodology to use cms-hcc prospective risk scores to adjust the historical benchmark for changes in severity and case mix for all assigned beneficiaries.  the adjustment is subject to a symmetrical cap of positive or negative three percent for the agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019, and in subsequent years.  uhg does not support the proposed risk adjustment methodology changes.  both the aco and cms could be vulnerable with a three percent cap.  the proposed limit is not sufficient and would not protect the aco if there is a significant change in population demographics.\n use of regional factors in aco benchmarks\n cms is proposing to generally use the same methodology for determining the historical benchmarks for acos in their first agreement period and for subsequent periods.  under this proposal there would be an adjustment in the weights applied during each benchmark year of ten percent, thirty percent, and sixty percent respectively.  we agree with the proposed regional historic methodology weights and time periods, however, we request that cms provide additional clarification on how this proposal will impact the majority of acos participating in the mssp.\n voluntary beneficiary alignment\n cms seeking comments on the voluntary alignment of beneficiaries.  uhg does not support this proposal and strongly objects to voluntary beneficiary alignment as proposed by cms.   acos are challenged by the designation of patients based on the professionals already assigned to the aco.   this proposal, if finalized, would make it extremely difficult to track costs and could result in unintended detrimental effects.\n the proposed rule also seeks feedback on ways to increase beneficiary awareness of aco options and further improve the electronic process through which a beneficiary may voluntarily identify an aco professional as their primary care provider through my.medicare.gov for purposes of aco assignment. the proposed notification could prove detrimental to all acos, does not appear to align with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s integrity provisions, and potentially would allow some acos to selectively choose healthy patients while others are selected against.  we respectfully urge cms to carefully review this proposal and the potential impacts prior to finalizing.\n\n\n promoting interoperability\n uhg supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recommendation to use the certified electronic health record technology (cehrt) process to determine eligibility for initial participation by the aco in the promoting interoperability program.  we agree that asking acos to certify that at least fifty percent of their eligible clinicians use cehrt as part of the annual certification of compliance with mssp requirements.\n we also recommend that cms adopt certain clinical data exchange requirements in the aco setting. uhg promotes full clinical data integration with care providers into our vbc model.  health information technology, particularly capabilities tied to interoperable health data exchange, has an important role to play in our integrated vbc strategy.   health data interoperability provides the foundation to improve outcomes, decrease costs, and improve patient experience.\n our clinical data exchange and integration plan has the following elements which cms should consider for aco participants \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the approach we use (a) is based on hl7 interoperability standards; (b)  works with care providers to exchange admission and discharge notifications, discharge orders/summaries and clinical documentation, including progress notes and laboratory results in an agreed upon electronic format compliant with office of the national coordinator for health information technology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promoting interoperability standards; and (c) specifies the frequency and timeliness of data exchange using real-time data exchange as often as possible.\n in addition, provider electronic health records must allow access on-site and remotely for purposes of successful clinical data integration allowing hipaa defined  treatment and healthcare operations including concurrent inpatient care coordination, national committee for quality assurance (ncqa) audits, and discharge planning and post-discharge care coordination.\n development of meaningful quality measures\n uhg fully supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new initiative to promote meaningful measures in the quality and cost areas. quality measure development organizations have processes to promote meaningful outcomes associated with non-burdensome measures based on stakeholder input.   measures should be constantly monitored and updated yearly based on best evidence.  in this context, we recommend that cms align the star ratings program measures and ncqa healthcare effectiveness data and information set (hedis) measures with the macra standards as well as other measures used in interoperability incentive programs that it oversees and leads.  for example, measure 8 in the aco measures chart should be aligned with star ratings and ncqa measures and not be outside the scope or reporting requirements of either entity.\n the alignment of measures will dramatically reduce the operational burdens placed on providers who participate in multiple accreditation and incentive programs, and will help payers assisting providers to meet their requirements.  if these measures are placed within an incentives program like the cms star ratings initiative, we believe health plans and other stakeholders would be meaningfully aligned in improving and promoting interoperability.\n of this request, and we would be pleased to participate in further discussion with cms regarding this issue.\n addressing the opioid epidemic\n uhg works very closely with its aco providers to combat opioid misuse.  we send a monthly report regarding opiate utilization that displays information on a per member per month basis by prescriber. this report also highlights high prescribers with high utilizing members.  we also share more in-depth reports indicating prevalence of opioid use disorder (oud) and overdose diagnosis and medication assisted treatment (mat) to give our providers a more robust picture of their patients facilitating treatment and care coordination based on better data and information.  in addition, we make available educational materials for aco health care providers, including topics such as opioid tapering, non-opioid pain treatment alternatives, naloxone prescribing guidance and coverage, and how to locate in-network mat providers.\n we support the inclusion of opioid quality measures listed by cms to address the opioid epidemic to improve patient safety.  however, we recommend that cms break out these two measures into three categories that would highlight: (a) four or more prescribers; (b) four or more pharmacies; and (c) four or more prescribers and four or more pharmacies for target intervention.\n nqf #2950 (use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer) should be reported as follows:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 measure 1: analyzes the proportion (xx out of 1,000) of medicare part d beneficiaries 18 years or older without cancer or enrolled in hospice receiving prescriptions for opioids from four (4) or more prescribers \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 measure 2: analyzes the proportion (xx out of 1,000) of medicare part d beneficiaries 18 years or older without cancer or enrolled in hospice receiving prescriptions for opioids from four (4) or more pharmacies \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 measure 3: analyzes the proportion (xx out of 1,000) of medicare part d beneficiaries 18 years or older without cancer or enrolled in hospice receiving prescriptions for opioids from four (4) or more prescribers and four (4) or more pharmacies.\n nqf #2951 (use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer) should be reported as follows:\n\n in addition, uhc includes the measures developed by the cdc in its opioid guidelines, and recommend that cms include these measures as well:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 percentage of initial opioid prescription that is immediate-release instead of extended- release/long-acting (er/la) \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 percentage of initial opioid prescription with daily dosage < 50 morphine milligram equivalent  (mme) \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 percentage of  initial opioid prescription with less than 7 days of supply\n promoting telehealth care delivery mechanisms\n uhg supports telehealth as an enabling technology and care delivery innovation among customers, patients and care providers to achieve the triple aim of better health, better care and better cost controls. telehealth can help accomplish these goals by:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 better health - improving outcomes via enhanced care delivery options and high-value care delivery. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 better care - enhancing the patient experience and access to care while maintaining care continuity with primary care and other health care providers. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 better cost control - reducing per capita costs by engaging consumers at lower-level points of access and/or lower intensity services.\n cms proposes that the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home would be a permissible originating site type for telehealth services furnished by a physician or practitioner participating in an applicable aco.  to support this approach, we ask cms to clarify how they will determine that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe telehealth services must not be inappropriate to furnish in the home setting\u00e2\u0080\u009d (42 cfr \u00e2\u00a7425.613(a)(1)(iv)) and define the \u00e2\u0080\u009cinappropriate use of telehealth services.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (42 cfr \u00e2\u00a7425,613(d)(2)).  in addition, we ask whether there be different coding requirements when the patient is at home to allow payers the ability to differentiate between the cms defined originating site and the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home which is not currently provided.  issuing guidance on these issues will better assist providers and payers in establishing appropriate telehealth services.\n use of stop-loss coverage\n under the proposed new model - pathways to success does not allow an option for acos to opt out of the individual stop loss provision, unlike the flexibility provided under the next generation aco model. uhg recommends that cms allow acos the ability to opt out of the specific stop loss protection if desired, and purchase this coverage on the open marketplace.   this approach allows acos to structure coverage to specifically meet their organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk tolerance as opposed to a nationwide ninety-nine percentile truncated approach.  in addition, competitive pricing will often result in lower costs for this protection\n\n\n", "0354": "see attached file(s)\n\n october 16, 2018\n\nms. seema verma \n administrator centers for medicare & medicaid services department of health and human services attn:

administrator verma:\n on behalf of the virginia hospital & healthcare association\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (vhha) 27 member health systems, representing 110 community, psychiatric, rehabilitation, and specialty hospitals, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) proposed rule regarding the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and accountable care organizations (aco).  while we understand cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concern regarding the level of downside risk borne by current participants, vhha believes that the sweeping overhaul proposed in the rule will discourage participation and hamper efforts to improve quality and reduce costs.\n in the rule, cms proposes to discontinue tracks 1 and 2 of the mssp.  cms would instead offer two tracks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 basic and enhanced \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that acos could enter for not less than five years.  the basic track would use a \u00e2\u0080\u009cglide path\u00e2\u0080\u009d to risk where acos would begin with one-sided risk and incrementally phase in the two-sided risk and reward.  the enhanced track is based on the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing track 3 and would offer acos the highest level of risk.  under the basic track, acos would only have upside-risk during the first two years, compared to six years under the current program, with the downside risk increased at various levels in years three through five.  for the enhanced track, the upside and downside risk begin in the first year.\n vhha is concerned that limiting upside only risk to two years will discourage hospitals, physicians, and other providers from participating in acos.  providers invest significant resources to develop the programs and systems necessary to improve quality and reduce costs when participating in an aco.  providers also enter into aco arrangements at different starting points with varying capacities and resources to support the program.  while we appreciate that cms has proposed to scale the increase in risk, a better approach would be to increase risk based on milestones developed in consultation with the provider community instead of set timeframes. these milestones should revolve around systems development, quality improvement, and cost reduction, with the downside risk increasing as provider achieve specific goals.  if an aco does not meet these milestones, a three to four year hard cap on upside only risk would be more appropriate than two years.\n\nms. seema verma \n cms-1701-p page 2\n we are, however, encouraged by cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to extend more flexibility to aco participants. in particular, we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow physicians in acos to receive reimbursement for telehealth services provided to patients regardless of their location.  we also support applying cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 meaningful measures framework to acos to ensure that performance measures have a meaningful impact on improving quality and reducing costs.  additionally, expanding applicability of the skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver to acos using preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment, as well as snf services furnished under swing bed arrangements, will expand access to post-acute care for patients.\n thank you again for the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule.  should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact matt strader (mstrader@vhha.com, 804- 965-1221) or myself (jandrews@vhha.com; 804-965-1227) at your convenience.\n sincerely,\n\n\n", "0355": "1) for those acos that went into mssp track 1+ in 2018 as a pilot year, with the expectation that it would be offered for another 3 years; the fact that the rule change would force acos (deemed as 'mature') into the newly proposed enhanced track, with considerable downside risk, is unreasonable and a stretch. - it will force many good acos to quit mssp participation.\r\n\r\n1a) we would suggest that 'mature/experienced' acos have the option to select either of the two-sided proposed track options, either level d or e.\r\n\r\n2) re: the mssp performance benchmarking methodology: the application of the 'lesser of' related to hcc/raf adjustment, either current year performance or year-3 of the benchmark, is unreasonable! it penalizes acos who have demonstrated improvement and are seeing a higher acuity patient population; yet, limits it to a prior year's (benchmark year 3), when acos were not as advanced and not yet able to demonstrate enhanced chronic care management and hcc capture.\r\nrecommendation: use the current year's raf/hcc score.\r\n\r\n2a) benchmarking: the prior 3-year benchmark should be based on the most recent 3-years (i.e. 2015-2017 for performance year 2018) vs. the method today which is the prior 3-years upon renewal in mssp (i.e., 2013-2015 for py 2018). - the populations can change dramatically during that 2-year lag; and due to the limitations of the raf-hcc adjustment (lesser of current vs. baseline year-3), it does not accurately reflect changes in the acuity and patient turnover (churn) in mssp attributed population.\r\n\r\n3) attribution methodology: last year's change to to allow patients to attribute to specialists who have middle-level providers (advance practice clinicians) bill with an e/m code is severely flawed. it inappropriately assumes that a patient's health is completely managed by a specialty provider such as an orthopedist... it is not! additionally, because a provider can only be in one mssp participating aco, it has the unintended consequence of fracturing/splitting the community-based specialty provider network. recommendation: patients should not attribute to specialists.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     ", "0356": "on behalf of northern light health (formerly emhs) member organizations

behalf of the amga, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedicare program: medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success,\u00e2\u0080\u009d proposed rule (cms-1701-p).\nfounded in 1950, amga represents more than 450 multi-specialty medical groups and integrated delivery systems representing approximately 177,000 physicians who care for one-in-three americans.  our member medical groups work diligently to provide innovative, high quality patient-centered medical care in a spending efficient manner.  many of our medical groups currently participate in the medicare shared savings program (mssp), or the accountable care organization (aco), in the track 1+ and next generation aco demonstrations, the comprehensive primary care + model, as well as other related medicare demonstrations.  amga, therefore, continues to have a very strong interest in improving population health, care quality and reducing medicare spending growth.\nwe begin with a list of our key recommendations.\namga objects to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 persistence in measuring program performance against aco benchmarks since they are not valid counterfactuals.  for this reason, amga disagrees that spending relative to benchmarks serves as a justification for a more rapid transition into risk-bearing acos.\nto allow providers a reasonable chance to succeed under the mssp, cms needs to improve program benchmarking to correct for current weak financial incentives.  moreover, cms should discontinue use of historical spending in resetting subsequent agreement period benchmarks. this corrects for providers having to endlessly improve upon past performance.  instead, cms should simply update benchmarks annually after the first performance period.  the current use of a regional blend factor, however calculated, does nothing to address the underlying flaw of continuing use of historical spending.\nproviders participating in the proposed aco basic track should have the option to remain in an upside-only track for three years, rather than the two years that cms has proposed (essentially discounting py 2019).  that is, they should be given the option of a second year under basic b.  as proposed, new acos would receive 2.5 years of upside only; continuing track 1 acos can sign a new five-year agreement on july 1, 2019 and get an additional two years of upside only, or they can sign a new agreement beginning january 2020 or january 2021 and receive an additional two years of upside only.\ncms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal of a 25 percent shared savings rate for basic levels a and b further weakens what are already nominal financial incentives.  the shared savings rate should be no less than 50 percent for upside-only acos.  upside only \u00e2\u0080\u009clow revenue acos should receive higher earned shared savings, for example, 75 percent or 80 percent.\ncms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to define high- versus low- revenue acos as those with revenue more than or less than 25 percent of their assigned beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 annual part a and b expenditures is too restrictive.  cms should start at 30 percent and consider other metrics in distinguishing the two and/or define risk tolerance more granularly.\ncms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to terminate an aco from the program if it falls outside the negative minimum savings rate (msr) or minimum loss rate (mlr) corridor is an unnecessary provision, as acos in the proposed glide path will assume financial risk.  in addition, it cannot be determined that acos that fall outside of their negative corridor, are, in fact, losing the medicare program money as benchmarks are not valid counterfactuals.\namga supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to (more) accurately risk score the continuously enrolled by allowing scores to increase by a maximum of three percent over the five-year agreement period.  we also recommend cms work to improve medicare risk scoring beyond use of hierarchical condition category (hcc) coding via, for example, select use of consumer assessment of health plans (cahps) data.\nas amga has argued previously, payment waivers for the skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule and telehealth and remote patient monitoring (rpm) should be available to all acos.  we disagree with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rationale for restricting these payment waivers to two-sided models. whether at-risk or not, the waivers provide acos with the ability to ensure patients are receiving the most appropriate care in the most appropriate setting.\nper the balanced budget act (bba) of 2018, amga supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to establish a voluntary beneficiary incentive program and a voluntary alignment program. amga believes other incentives should be added to incentivize beneficiaries to receive their care within an aco \u00e2\u0080\u009cnetwork.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\namga supports a voluntary beneficiary opt-in based assignment methodology.\namga supports the use of additional codes in defining primary care services for the purposes of beneficiary assignment.\namga encourages the agency to issue a notice of proposed rule making (nprm) or a request for information (rfi) that outlines proposed ways in which aco providers can, within legal and regulatory restraints, actively coordinate beneficiary care with part d providers.\namga also encourages cms to better align quality measure reporting requirements across the medicare program.\namga supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to align certified electronic health record technology (cehrt) across the mssp and the quality payment program (qpp).  currently set at 50 percent, this threshold would increase to 75% if cms finalizes the increase in its pending medicare physician fee schedule rule and opts to align the programs in this mssp proposal.\namga recommends cms provide additional clarity before moving forward with its proposal to address quality performance, scoring, and any financial reconciliation for acos that were affected by \u00e2\u0080\u009cextreme and uncontrollable circumstances.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\noverview comment\nover the past several years, amga has stated that the medicare program, as well as commercial payers, should continue to move toward value-based payment arrangements.  the current fee for service (ffs) payment model promotes volume of services provided and does not incent prevention or better patient health.  amga members are leaders in moving to value and are heavily invested in the mssp, in other merit-based incentive payment system's alternative payment models (mips apms), and advanced apms, including the next generation aco demonstration.\nconcerning the mssp, amga remains concerned that the program, since its inception in 2012, has suffered from weak financial incentives.  substantial evidence of this has been published in numerous health affairs, journal of the american medical association (jama), jama internal medicine, and the new england journal of medicine articles and in other reputable publications by academic researchers.  because of weak incentives, the mssp has produced limited financial savings to date.  however, it is important to note that what savings the program has produced, including savings achieved by track 1 acos, are widely under-appreciated.  the belief persists that program performance can be measured against aco benchmarks, or that they serve as valid counterfactuals.  they do not.  program performance has been compromised by, among other reasons, flaws in the program's financial benchmarking formulas, both in benchmark updating and in resetting or rebasing.  in addition, observers typically fail to fully account for or recognize favorable spillover effects, including those in the medicare advantage program.\nwe would also be remiss if we did not note that program quality improvement performance has markedly improved.  in performance years 2016 and 2017, the mean composite quality performance scores were 93 percent and 91 percent respectively.\nbecause of weak financial incentives, we were not surprised to read, for example, in the harvard department of health care policy comment letter dated september 18, \u00e2\u0080\u009cacos have had little incentive to ever lower spending because of the link between the spending reductions they achieve and subsequent benchmarks.  one could argue that it is astonishing that the mssp has produced any savings at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the current proposed rule suggests cms believes it is time to create an mssp 2.0.  this is made evident in the proposed rule's executive summary where the agency argues the program needs to be \u00e2\u0080\u009credesigned\u00e2\u0080\u009d or reinvented.  again, because of weak financial incentives, we do not believe the program needs redesign.  the problem to date has been the lack of legitimate opportunity to succeed under mssp 1.0.\namga recognizes the proposed rule offers several potential, if not real, improvements to the program.  for example, the proposed rule would improve how the agency risk adjusts for the continuously assigned beneficiary.  these improvements aside, the program has always been largely defined by how the agency calculates aco benchmarks.  cms proposes to reform how the agency calculates established and reset or rebased benchmarks by revising its use of a regional blend.  as we argue below, this proposed change, while well intended, cannot correct an inherently flawed benchmark formula.  incorporating a regional blend is problematic per se.  simply stated, we recommend the agency simply update annually an aco's benchmark after performance year one and not reset or rebase the aco's benchmark using historical spending.  this would obviate the need for a regional blend.  again, because the program suffers from weak incentives, commensurate with this change, we also recommend cms substantially increase the percent of earned shared savings for those acos with comparatively low spending in their region. we also recommend the agency exclude an aco's spending in calculating annual benchmark updates.\nwe believe that if the agency improves mssp financial benchmarking by correcting for the perverse effects of the regional blend, and as we argue below, make improvements to risk adjustment, risk tolerance, quality performance benchmarking and beneficiary engagement, the agency can expect the provider community to continue to be enthusiastic mssp participants.\nproposed basic and enhanced tracks\nbriefly summarized, cms proposes to create two new aco tracks: basic and enhanced.  the basic track would consist of five levels: a through e.  basic a and b would present no financial risk.  level c through e would pose increasing financial risk.  by level e, acos would face financial risk comparable to the current track 1+.  the proposed enhanced track would be comparable to the current track 3.  track 1, 1+ and track 2 models would sunset.  under the proposed rule beginning july 1, 2019, newly formed acos that are also \u00e2\u0080\u009clow revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d could participate under basic a for ostensibly two performance years, or half of 2019, or july 1 through december 31, and all of calendar year 2020 and 2021.  existing or renewing track 1 acos would have to begin with basic b beginning july 1, 2019.  participating 2018 acos that sunset on december 31 of this year can continue in the program through june 30, 2019 without having their financial benchmark reset.\nessentially, cms is reducing providers' current ability to participate in the mssp at no risk from six years via two contracts of three years each.  under the proposed glide path, providers will have a maximum of two years before moving into a risk-bearing model.  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to accelerate the transition from no risk to at risk is what the agency terms, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpressing concern,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for several reasons.  the agency argues, in part, at risk or two-sided aco models outperform no risk acos.  although amga rejects how cms calculates savings in the mssp, we understand cms has concluded in 2016 that 68 percent of two-sided acos shared savings compared to 29 percent of track 1 acos.  cms also notes 41 percent of \u00e2\u0080\u009clow revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shared savings compared to 23 percent of \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos.  cms is also concerned the presence of no risk or upside only acos may be encouraging marketplace consolidation.\nwe do not believe there is adequate information to conclude at risk acos out-compete no risk acos.  among other reasons, again, it has been convincingly demonstrated that aco financial benchmarks are not legitimate counterfactuals.  in addition, cms admits that in 2016, 15 of 22 at risk track 2 and 3 acos shared savings.  this sample size is too small to draw a definitive conclusion.\nwhile we support the move to risk-bearing agreements, our members have expressed concern that limiting upside agreements to two years does not take into account operational challenges in transitioning into an essentially new mssp program.  we believe cms should offer a third, upside only year.   among other reasons, we offer seven.  first, performance cannot or should not be measured relative to benchmarks.  for example, up until 2017, benchmarks were updated annually using a national growth factor only, despite the fact spending growth varies geographically.  the national growth factor includes all beneficiaries, including those who had no calendar year spending.  this compromises the accuracy of national updates; and, aco spending reductions also are included in the national growth factor, further artificially lowering the update.  in sum, benchmarks, specifically those of upside only acos, should not be used to rationalize accelerating risk agreements.\nsecond, assuming cms finalizes many of the proposed changes in this rule, providers should be given adequate time to adjust to these regulatory changes.  essentially, cms has created a new mssp program and acos will need at least a year to understand how these new regulatory changes affect their operations.  additionally, while cms has been diligent in working to ensure the timely sharing of aco data, the fact remains that there is a year plus data lag to acos.  thus, acos will not truly understand how or whether their care management processes are working for more than a year after they enter the program.\nthird, the program is reducing medicare spending.  in its september 18 letter, harvard scholars estimate $431 million in savings, particularly in post-acute care, over 2014 and 2015. therefore, there is certainly no urgent need to impose downside risk.  fourth, cms does not want to risk momentum in program participation, particularly among acos that are positive within their msr corridor.  fifth, cms should recognize upside only does not mean acos are at no risk of losing their investments in administrative and reporting costs.  acos have invested in the necessary health information technology, care management processes, staffing, and related infrastructure to assume responsibility for a patient population. logically, if track 1 were not at risk, fewer providers would remain in the program.  instead, nearly half of the 2012-2013 track 1 class and a third of the 2014 class have dropped out of the program.  sixth, the intended positive effect risk bearing imposes, that it will enhance savings, will be mitigated by, among other options, acos partnering with third-party management firms to limit their risk exposure. finally, cms should critically evaluate whether there is, in fact, a correlation between upside only agreements and industry consolidation, as the agency suggests there is.  we see no evidence that supports this belief.\nspecifically, amga supports the agency's proposals to:\nextend the current agreement period from three to five years\nallow acos to select their basic level prior to the start of a performance year\nallow acos in any basic and the enhanced track the flexibility to change their selection of beneficiary assignment methodology, either prospective or prospective with retrospective reconciliation, prior to the start of the performance year\nallow acos to forgo the formal 2019 application cycle\nallow acos with a participation agreement ending date of december 31, 2018, or the 2012 and 2013 acos and the 2016 acos, to extend their current agreement to june 30, 2019\nallow existing acos to terminate their agreement effective june 30, 2019 and restart under a new five year agreement on july 1, 2019\nallow existing track 1s, defined as \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that enter the basic track on july 1, 2019 to remain in basic b until january 2021\nallow existing track 1s that choose to complete their current agreement the choice to re-enter the program under basic b, c, d or e\nallow acos in all other current tracks to continue under their existing agreement until they expire\nintegrate track 1+ into the mssp\nallow track 2 acos the option to elect to enter the proposed enhanced track or elect to enter the proposed basic track at the highest level of risk or level e\nallow low revenue acos the ability to transition from basic to enhanced after a single agreement period under basic while retaining the opportunity to return to the basic\ngradually increase risk thresholds at basic level c and level d at two and four percent of revenue, respectively, and set basic level e at the current track 1+ risk level.\namga recognizes providers need a glide path to succeed under the mssp.   we believe if cms makes the appropriate improvements to the mssp discussed below, providers will have an improved glide path to succeed under incremental financial risk as proposed in this rule.\nuse of regional factors when establishing and resetting acos benchmarks\nbecause cms currently resets financial benchmarks using historical spending based on the aco's immediately previous three performance years, or their just concluded agreement period, it becomes increasingly difficult for acos to improve upon their past performance.  for this reason, cms in 2016 introduced a regional adjustment to the reset or rebased historical benchmark beginning with the aco's second agreement period.\ncms is now proposing to include a regional adjustment to initial aco agreements beginning july 1, 2019 and to all subsequent agreements. cms also proposes to revise the regional blend weights.  specifically, cms proposes to continue to apply a first time 35 percent regional weight if the aco's historical spending was lower than its region and a 25 percent regional weight if the aco's historical spending was higher than its region.  however, in subsequent agreement periods, cms is proposing to reduce the regional blend weights.  for second agreement periods, cms is proposing to apply a regional weight of 50 percent if the aco's historical spending was lower than its region and 35 percent if the aco's historical spending was higher than its region.  in third and subsequent agreement periods, the regional blend would be 50 percent for all acos.\ncms argues it is lowering the regional blend weights because in instances where the aco's spending is lower than its region, \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-spending acos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the agency states, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay become overly inflated to the point where these organizations need to do little to maintain or change their practices to generate savings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the regional blend also presents a problem regarding acos with spending comparatively higher than their region.  for acos with comparatively higher spending, a regional blend is a disincentive for them from participating in the program or continuing to participate in the program, particularly when the agency is proposing to require aco participants to take on financial risk earlier.  as dr. j. michael mcwilliams and his harvard colleagues reported in their september 18 letter in response to the proposed mssp rule, \u00e2\u0080\u009cintroduction of the regional adjustment in 2017 was associated with a 21 percent drop out in the 2014 aco cohort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and these were the acos that \u00e2\u0080\u009chad higher spending for their region than those who remained in the program.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  mcwilliams terms this problem, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccost-increasing selective participation\u00e2\u0080\u009d because the selective drop out of acos with comparatively higher spending creates perverse incentives.\nthe agency's proposal to mitigate the perverse effects of the regional blend is inadequate.  it does nothing to solve the inherent problem: the agency's policy to reset or rebase an acos benchmark using their historical spending.  if the agency addressed or remedied this problem there would be no need for adding a regional blend.  not surprisingly, mcwilliams and his colleagues conclude, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe recommend replacing the regional adjustment with higher shared savings rates for acos with lower spending for their service area.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  they recommend shared savings rates rise continuously from a minimum of 50 percent for acos with comparatively high regional spending to shared savings rates at 80 percent for acos with comparatively low regional spending.  they recommend also the agency use two years of data to assess an aco's spending relative to their region.  while we are not certain these shared savings percentages are perfect, they improve upon current weak financial incentives, and help level the playing field between high and low spending acos. they would not, as mcwilliams and his colleagues argue, mean higher shared savings would decrease net savings to the medicare program.  they argue, for example, higher shared savings rates would attract more provider participation and provide additional motivation to lower spending.  eliminating a regional blend would also obviate the need, as cms proposes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto cap the regional adjustment amount using a flat dollar amount equal to the 5 percent of national per capita expenditures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwe noted the impetus for adding a regional blend was to mitigate the problem of resetting benchmarks using, or still using, an aco's historical spending.  we further recommend the agency abandon the practice of benchmark resets in all subsequent aco agreement periods.  here again, logic forces us to agree with dr. mcwilliams and his colleagues.  in their september 18 letter, they recommend, \u00e2\u0080\u009celiminate rebasing of benchmarks that links an aco's new benchmark to its spending changes in the prior period.  this link should be completely severed.  instead, the aco's original baseline should be updated annually according to a growth rate that is unrelated to its prior performance, adjusting for changes in the acos' participating providers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  resetting or rebasing an aco's benchmark, which would occur every five years under the proposed rule, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreatly diminishes acos' incentives to ever save because,\u00e2\u0080\u009d mcwilliams, et al. write, \u00e2\u0080\u009cspending reductions now are penalized with lower benchmarks later.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  because of the link between spending reductions and subsequent benchmarks, they go so far as to state, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is astonishing that the mssp has produced any savings at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  they note, not surprisingly, that just prior to 2016 when the 2012-2013 class would be required to have their benchmarks reset, 23 percent dropped out of the program, or nearly four times the percent the left the program in both 2013 and 2014.  while we do not support the continued use of a regional blend in resetting or rebasing and now, as cms proposes, in establishing benchmarks as well, we want to make clear amga continues to support the use of regional spending in calculating annual benchmark updates.\nwe also are obligated to note as we have in past comment letters our concern that cms continues to include an aco's spending on its assigned beneficiaries in calculating annual benchmark updates.  this  formula is increasingly problematic as acos account for an ever-increasing percentage of the ffs population in their region.  this is the same problem or error in aco benchmark resetting.  this approach makes it difficult to determine if acos are reducing spending compared to a counterfactual.\nin sum, via these benchmark-related changes, cms has the opportunity to simplify the program, increase financial incentives, level the playing field, improve participation and retention, and drive greater savings.\nlevels of risk and reward in the basic track's glide path\nfor basic levels a and b, cms is proposing a final earned shared savings rate of 25 percent based on quality performance to first dollar shared savings for acos that meet or exceeded their msr.  earned shared savings would be not exceed 10 percent of the aco's updated benchmark, consistent with current track 1 policy.  basic level c would be able to earn upwards of 30 percent in earned shared savings.  since level c is at risk, shared losses would not exceed two percent of total a and b revenue.  if this amount exceeds one percent of the aco's updated benchmark the loss sharing limit is capped at one percent of the updated benchmark.  level d risk allows for upwards of 40 percent in earned shared savings with shared losses not to exceed four percent of total a and b revenue, or two percent of the updated benchmark.  level e would allow for upwards of 50 percent in earned shared savings with shared losses commensurate with the revenue-based loss-sharing limit for an advanced apm.\nas noted above, current mssp financial incentives are weak.  beyond benchmark updating and resetting problems, current financial incentives are further diluted by the fact that acos bear the upfront and ongoing costs of program participation.  in addition, aco quality performance benchmarking, distinctly unlike the medicare advantage star quality program, remains downside only.  an aco's quality performance benchmark multiplier cannot be better than 1.0.  in effect, cms' proposal to further weaken already inadequate financial incentives will only make matters worse.  therefore, amga cannot support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to reduce shared savings to below 50 percent.  instead, to maintain an incentive for program participation, the shared savings rate should be 50 percent for upside-only acos.  more specifically, stronger financial incentives should be offered to \u00e2\u0080\u009clow revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos and those acos taking increasing levels of risk.  they should be able to earn shared savings up to 75 percent or 80 percent.\n\ndifferentiating between low revenue acos and high revenue acos\ncms proposes low and high revenue acos for the purposes of further defining participation options.\ncms proposes to define a low revenue aco as one whose revenue is below 25 percent of its assigned beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 total part a and b expenditures for the most recent calendar year.  cms defines high revenue as an aco with revenue that is at least 25 percent of its beneficiaries' part a and b expenditures.  low revenue acos tend to be, cms' analysis found, physician-only and/or rural based acos.  high revenue acos would tend to be or include a hospital.  with more control over their total spending and/or being better capitalized, high revenue acos, cms argues, should be more ready and capable of accepting higher financial risk.  low revenue acos less so.   as noted above, for purposes of aco participation, cms is proposing to allow low revenue acos to participate in basic for as long as two, five-year agreement periods.\ncms seeks comments on their proposed definition of low and high revenue, any alternatives including defining by hospital-based and physician-led based on their tax identification number (tin) composition, and differentiating low and high by the size of their assigned populations.\nin theory, amga supports the distinction between low and high revenue acos.  there is intuitive logic that risk tolerance be commensurate with organization size or financial wherewithal.  in practice, low volume acos would be afforded the opportunity to participate at lower risk thresholds for a comparatively longer period.  cms notes its analysis found that 88 percent of self-reported small, physician only and rural acos met the 25 percent threshold.  this point aside, since self-reporting is imperfect, should the agency finalize this distinction, we recommend the agency begin with a 30 percent threshold or margin to account for physician groups with a comparatively larger number of specialists.  over time, the agency can adjust the percent threshold as their ability to discriminate improve.  we also recommend cms consider more than two revenue definitions or categories.  the proposed distinction may be too stark.  concerning alternative definitions using self-reported composition, tins, and size of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population, we similarly encourage the agency to consider using more than one metric or data point in differentiating acos.  that is, low and high revenue could and should be defined by multiple criteria.\nminimum savings rate and minimum loss rate\nin cms' final june 2015 mssp rule, the agency offered at-risk acos the option to select a msr/mlr that will apply for the duration of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3-year agreement period.  under current policy, acos applying to participate in a two-sided model may select from three options: 0% msr/mlr, symmetrical msr/mlr in 0.5% increments between 0.5% and 2.0%, and an upside/downside symmetrical msr that varies based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number of assigned beneficiaries.\ncms is proposing to maintain the same msr/mlr options\u00e2\u0080\u0094both for one-sided and two-sided models\u00e2\u0080\u0094as applicable to the model under which the aco is participating in the basic glide path. therefore, one-sided models would have a variable msr based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number of assigned beneficiaries.  those in two-sided models--basic c, d or e--would select from the options outlined above before the start of their first performance year under risk.  this would also apply if an aco elects to transition more quickly in the glide path or from level a to level c or beyond.\namga supports this proposal.\nrisk adjustment methodology for adjusting historical benchmark each performance year\naco stakeholders have criticized the agency's policy using a risk scoring methodology that differs between newly assigned and continuously assigned aco beneficiaries.  cms uses hierarchical condition category (hcc) prospective risk scores to account for changes in severity and case mix for newly assigned aco beneficiaries between the third benchmark year and the performance year for newly assigned beneficiaries and in subsequent agreement period performance years.  cms uses demographic factors only to adjust risk scores for the continuously assigned aco beneficiaries, or those that are assigned to the aco year- over-year through the performance agreement.  as the proposed rule reminds stakeholders, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif the cms-hcc prospective risk scores for the continuously assigned population are lower in the performance year, we use the lower cms-hcc prospective risk scores to adjust for changes in severity and case mix in this population.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nin the proposed rule, cms states the agency's \u00e2\u0080\u009cpreferred approach would eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  however, the agency has been reluctant to do so because of concerns regarding coding intensity.  nevertheless, cms admits in its examination of the continuously enrolled in 2016, 86 percent of those continuously enrolled in an aco would have received a larger positive adjustment to their benchmark had they been coded the same as the newly enrolled.   the agency's concern is that perpetuating this policy for the continuously enrolled could incent acos to avoid complex patients.  therefore, cms is proposing a symmetrical cap of a positive or negative three percent for the agreement period such that between benchmark year 3 (by3) and any performance year there would never be more than a three percent adjustment in either direction.  the proposed change would take effect july 1, 2019.\namga has argued for years that cms more appropriately or accurately risk score the continuously enrolled.  therefore, we strongly support this proposed change.  while cms notes their study of risk score trends shows that for aco aged/non-dual beneficiaries, the enrollment category that represents the majority of assigned aco beneficiaries, less than 30 percent of acos would see limited positive risk adjustment.  we appreciate cms providing this data point, however, we encourage cms to make fully transparent their research related to this finding, or its findings on the three other aco assigned beneficiary categories.\nin addition, we believe cms can always do more to improve medicare risk scoring, or move beyond hcc coding.  for example, in a march 2016 health affairs article, sherri rose and her colleagues reported that their \u00e2\u0080\u009cfindings suggest that a regional benchmark adjusted only for standard claims-based variables could unfairly penalize acos serving sicker patients.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  as a remedy, these researchers argue, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe aco cahps survey could provide valuable additional information for risk adjustment purposes\u00e2\u0080\u009d such as measures of functional status.  use of cahps data, the researchers argue, could also be used to detect upcoding and thus allow cms to evolve beyond the agency's proposed three percent cap for the continuously enrolled.\nmonitoring for financial performance\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cnow that we have additional experience with monitoring aco financial performance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms states, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe believe that the current regulations are insufficient to address recurrent poor financial performance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  cms states further, \u00e2\u0080\u009csome acos may not have sufficient incentive to remain accountable for the expenditures of their assigned beneficiaries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d therefore, cms is proposing to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonitor for whether the expenditures for the aco's assigned beneficiary population are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  if an aco falls outside or beyond its negative msr or mlr corridor, cms is proposing pre-termination actions.  if the aco falls beyond its negative msr or mlr corridor for another year, cms proposes to terminate the aco's participation.  cms notes only 19 of 194 of first year track 1 acos that renewed (in 2016) fell outside of their negative corridor in their first agreement period.  the agency observed similar performance results for acos that started their first agreement period in 2014 and 2015.\namga certainly supports agency efforts to protect medicare beneficiaries and medicare trust funds.  that said, since again benchmarks are not valid counterfactuals, it is impossible to determine whether acos that fall below or outside their negative mlr corridor are losing the medicare program money.  even assuming acos falling outside their negative mlr corridor are, in fact, losing money, should the proposed rule go final, participating aco providers will have significantly less time participating in upside only or no risk agreements or significantly less time to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cunaccountable for the expenditures of their assigned beneficiaries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  that is how the proposed basic glide path remedies or solves for this problem.  we will add, somewhat ironically, acos outside their negative mlr corridor are saving money in the sense that they are not earning shared savings.\nunder this discussion, cms also notes the agency \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsidered prohibiting acos from obtaining reinsurance to mitigate performance-based risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the agency therefore seeks comment on \u00e2\u0080\u009cacos' use of reinsurance, including their ability to obtain viable reinsurance products covering a medicare ffs population.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  considering the program's history of weak financial incentives, flawed financial benchmarking, limits on risk adjustment, and downside only quality performance benchmarking, we find it difficult to believe prohibiting at risk aco providers from purchasing reinsurance would ultimately benefit participating acos and the medicare program.\nsnf 3-day rule and telehealth waiver rules\nas we argued in our february 2015 comments in response to cms' december 2014 proposed mssp rule, the snf payment waiver should be made available to all acos.  first, because the snf 3-day waiver dates back to the inception of the medicare program more than 50 years ago, we agree with former medicare payment advisor commission chairman glenn hackbarth's assessment that the rule has become \u00e2\u0080\u009carchaic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the snf rule was created when mean hospital lengths of stay were substantially more than twice what they are today.  meeting the 3-day rule in the 1960s was easily accomplished.  today that is no longer the case.  second, the proposed rule recognizes aco program participants need a glide path to risk.  as we wrote in our 2015 comments, providers need the ability to reform their practice patterns before they are required to take on financial risk.  the snf and telehealth waivers enable providers an ability to do this.  intentionally denying them these tools, in effect, compromises the success of the program.  third, the benefit of prolonging a beneficiary's hospital stay such that he or she qualify for a snf admission is far outweighed by the potential iatrogenic harm extended hospital stays present.  finally, five years of performance data demonstrate program savings have been substantially driven by reductions in snf utilization, which lends evidence that the aco provider community is uninterested in abusing snf care.\ncms continues to argue in this proposed rule, risk-bearing models have more impetus \u00e2\u0080\u009cto engage in systematic change, promote accountability for a patient population and coordination of a patient medical care, and encourage investment in redesigned care processes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  even assuming this statement were true, it is neither a reason to deny no risk providers these waivers, nor an either-or instance.\namga does, however, support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow preliminary prospectively assigned beneficiaries to remain eligible for the 3-day snf rule waiver for the remainder of the performance year regardless of if their assignment status changes during the performance year.  effectively, beneficiaries would remain eligible to receive snf services under the waiver unless they meet one of two exceptions: they enroll in a medicare health plan or are no longer enrolled in part a or part b.  amga has no objection to this proposal.\nbeneficiary incentives\nthe bipartisan budget act (bba) of 2018 included a provision that allows acos to apply to operate a beneficiary incentive program.  specifically, the provision allows an aco to make an incentive payment of up to $20, in the form of a cash equivalent, for each qualifying service furnished to an aco assigned beneficiary.  the incentive payment, which cms proposed to begin july 1, 2019, would be made by the aco, not the medicare program, and the aco is responsible for all costs in establishing and operating the program.  a participating aco can, however, use earned shared savings to fund these payments.  payments made are disregarded in calculating an aco's benchmark.  cms is proposing to allow acos participating in two-sided risk models only to participate regardless of the aco's beneficiary assignment choice.\namga supports this voluntary program but strongly believes it should be available to all acos. as we note in this comment, cms needs to create a set of incentives for all acos to provide opportunity for success in the mssp program.  to further incent beneficiary participation and reduce leakage (discussed directly below) amga also supports cms waiving aco assigned beneficiary co-pays and deductibles if they remain within the aco \u00e2\u0080\u009cnetwork\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nrevisions to policies on voluntary alignment\nthe bba of 2018 also allows medicare ffs beneficiaries to voluntarily identify an aco provider as their primary care provider for the purposes of the beneficiary's assignment to the aco.  these beneficiaries would be assigned prospectively to an aco's list of assigned beneficiaries beginning with the subsequent performance year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 though the beneficiary would retain their right to change their designation at any time.  the mssp currently allows a beneficiary to select an aco provider, however, only if the provider meets one of the mssp primary specialty designations.  to satisfy the bba of 2018, cms proposes to assign a beneficiary to an aco based upon his or her selection of any aco professional, regardless of specialty, as their primary care clinician.  under this definition of voluntary alignment, cms is removing the requirement that the aco professional designated by the beneficiary be a primary care physician as defined under current mssp regulations.  the bba also allows the beneficiary to align with an aco independent of whether the beneficiary has received any services from the aco provider.  this means cms is removing the requirement that a beneficiary must have received at least one primary care service from the aco professional.  the beneficiary will remain assigned to the aco in which the provider participates during the entire aco agreement period and subsequent agreement periods even if the beneficiary no longer seeks treatment from the aco.  however, cms is proposing an exception that would limit voluntary assignment when the beneficiary also is eligible for assignment to an entity participating in a cms innovation center demonstration being tested or expanded.\namga has supported efforts to improve or expand methods by which a medicare beneficiary can participate in or receive care from an aco.  at least in theory, allowing for voluntary alignment addresses two problems.  first, as lynn barr and her colleagues noted in their may 11 health affairs blog essay, an aco with 5,000 assigned beneficiaries, the program minimum, have a 10 percent chance of randomly earning shared savings.  providing additional avenues to grow an aco's assigned beneficiary population helps to some extent mitigate this problem.  voluntary alignment would as well, at least in theory, help reduce program leakage, whereby the assigned beneficiary receives some or all of their care outside their assigned aco.  for example, the january norc at the university of chicago evaluation of the next generation aco (ngaco) demonstration found that 37 percent of ngaco assigned beneficiaries received their care outside the ngaco network and 47 percent received their care both in and out of the ngaco network.  leakage is particularly problematic when aco assignment is prospective.  however, we do not believe it would be counterproductive to assign voluntarily aligned beneficiaries that have not sought care via the aco in subsequent agreement periods, particularly when agreement periods are proposed to extend to five years.  it would exacerbate the leakage problem.\nbeneficiary opt-in based assignment methodology\nin the proposed rule cms states, the agency is \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsidering implementing an opt-in based assignment methodology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  as detailed, cms \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould allow, but not require, acos to elect an opt-in based assignment methodology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  for those acos that have elected this methodology, cms would use a hybrid assignment approach that would be based on \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-ins, supplemented by voluntary alignment and modified claims-based methodology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  opt-ins would be assigned prospectively.  if the beneficiary did not opt-in or voluntarily align, then the beneficiary would be assigned under this methodology to the aco only if he or she received at least seven primary care services from one or more of the aco's primary care providers.  beneficiaries would not be assigned even if they simply received a plurality of their primary care services from the aco.  currently, only approximately 25 percent of aco beneficiaries would meet the threshold assignment of seven primary care services.  cms identifies a seven services minimum, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause it would enable such acos to focus their care coordination activities on beneficiaries who have either opted-in to assignment to the aco or voluntarily aligned with the aco or who are receiving a high number of primary care services from aco professionals and may have complex conditions requiring coordination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  acos participating under this methodology would retain their ability to select prospective or prospective with retrospective reconciliation assignment.  cms is also seeking comment on whether to establish a geographic limitation on this methodology such that the beneficiary would be limited to acos located near the beneficiary's residence.  cms argues this approach could be more preferable than an opt-in only and/or a voluntary alignment approach (where currently 92 percent of the voluntarily aligned were already assigned to the same aco using the existing claims-based assignment methodology). it would likely provide stronger statistical confidence in determining financial performance and provide stronger incentives for acos and their participants to improve care delivery.  cms is also seeking comment on whether the agency should assign beneficiaries to all acos using this hybrid assignment approach.\namga supports the proposed opt-in based assignment methodology, as long as acos can voluntarily participate.  concerning a geographic limitation, while we recognize this would be difficult to formulate, we agree in principle that there be geographic limits placed in assigning aco beneficiaries.\nrevisions to the definition of primary care services used in beneficiary assignment\ncms is proposing to amend the definition of primary care services for the purposes of aco beneficiary assignment by adding an additional six current procedural terminology (cpt) codes and three healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) codes.  the cpt codes concern advance care planning, health risk assessments, psychotherapy services, annual depression screening, alcohol misuse screening and alcohol misuse counseling.  the three hcpcs codes are those created in the recent proposed physician fee schedule rule: gpc1x; gcg0x; and, gppro1.\namga supports the use of these additional codes.\nprogram data and quality measures\nas part of the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative, cms is focused on \u00e2\u0080\u009cupdating quality measures, reducing regulatory burden, and promoting innovation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  cms also notes in the proposed rule that it is \u00e2\u0080\u009cimportant that the quality reporting requirements\u00e2\u0080\u009d under the mssp \u00e2\u0080\u009calign with the reporting requirements\u00e2\u0080\u009d under other medicare initiatives, as well as other payers, to \u00e2\u0080\u009cminimize the need for shared shavings program participants to develop excessive resources in understanding differences in measure specifications or engaging in duplicative reporting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  as part of this effort, cms is requesting comments and recommendations on how to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfurther advance the quality measure set\u00e2\u0080\u009d for acos.  as a related aside, we note in the cy 2019 medicare physician fee schedule (pfs) proposed rule, cms noted its intention to reduce the total number of quality measures in the mssp measure set by seven in an effort to \u00e2\u0080\u009creduce the burden on acos and their participating providers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nin our response to the proposed cy 2019 pfs, we repeated our concern that the agency begin to measure for value, and correlate quality and spending or outcomes achieved relative to spending.  absent measuring for value, we wrote cms has created a situation in which the medicare program is \u00e2\u0080\u009cperversely awarding earned shared savings to acos that have comparatively worse quality than the worse performing acos or those falling below their negative medical savings or loss ratio.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwe are encouraged by cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 desire to align quality measure reporting requirements across medicare programs.  as we also noted in our pfs comments, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe see no reason why the mssp and the medicare advantage program's quality measures are different.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  among numerous others, former center for medicare and medicaid innovation (cmmi) deputy director sean cavanaugh made this same argument in his recent october 3 testimony before the senate aging committee.  for example, among the proposed 24 mssp 2019 measures, less than half are also included in the medicare advantage star ratings program.  we are also encouraged cms to begin to adopt a more routine use of patient reported outcome measures.\npromoting interoperability\ncms indicated its \u00e2\u0080\u009cdesire to continue to promote and encourage\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos to use certified electronic health record technology (cehrt) and align any requirements with the macra quality payment program (qpp).  to that end, cms is proposing to add a requirement that all acos \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemonstrate a specified level of cehrt use in order to be eligible to participate\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the mssp.   concurrent with this new requirement, cms is proposing to retire the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ehr quality measure (aco-11) effective january 1, 2019.\nfor acos that do not meet the financial requirements to qualify as an advanced apm, cms is proposing to require acos to certify that at least 50 percent of their eligible clinicians use cehrt to document and communicate clinical care to their patients and other providers.  this requirement, cms notes, would align the mssp with other care delivery models, including those being tested by the center for medicare and medicaid innovation (cmmi).  of note, this requirement would not relieve mips eligible clinicians who are participating acos from their need to report in the mips promoting interoperability performance category.\ncms also is proposing that in order for an aco to qualify as an advanced apm, the aco must certify that the percentage of eligible clinicians participating in the aco meet or exceed the cehrt thresholds as required by the qpp.  current regulations set this threshold at 50 percent.  however, as proposed in the pending physician fee schedule (pfs) rule for performance year 2019, cms would require advanced apms under the qpp to meet a 75 percent cehrt threshold.  cms is seeking comment on whether this higher threshold \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay be warranted now or in the future\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the mssp.  the mssp proposal would align the cehrt requirement with the qpp regulation for those acos that meet the financial risk criteria to qualify as and advanced apm.  this effectively would impose the higher threshold requirements on the basic level e and enhanced tracks.\nshould the pfs increase the cehrt threshold requirement to 75 percent, in finalizing this proposed rule, cms should match the percent.  cehrt threshold percentages should be aligned across apm models.\ncoordination of pharmacy care for aco beneficiaries\nin the proposed rule, cms notes briefly acos stakeholders continue to express interest in improving care coordination and collaboration with medicare part d drug plans to \u00e2\u0080\u009creduce the risk of adverse events and improve medication adherence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  cms provides a number of examples of how acos and part d plan sponsors might collaborate.  for example, cms states acos and part d plan sponsors may be able to enter business arrangements to \u00e2\u0080\u009csupport improved pharmacy care coordination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms is requesting comment on how mssp acos and part d plan sponsors could work together to improve coordination of pharmacy care for medicare ffs beneficiaries.  cms also is requesting comment on what type of support medicare acos would need from cms to establish new and innovative business arrangements to promote pharmacy care coordination.  cms also is interested in existing arrangements and what current barriers to coordination exist.\namga is interested in exploring ways to improve coordination between aco providers and medicare part d plans \u00e2\u0080\u0093 while avoiding anti-kickback and related legal restrictions.  as our members and the agency are well aware, medicare spending on part d benefits will reach $92 billion this year, or more than 16 percent of net medicare expenditures.  as has been widely reported, this spending has been rapidly trending upward, as the average annual rate growth in part d costs per beneficiary has increased to 4.4% annually between 2013 and 2016, as compared to 2.4% between 2007 and 2013.  this growth is expected to continue, due in part to the costs associated with specialty drugs.  therefore, we encourage the agency to publish in 2019, a proposed rule or request for information (rfi) that outlines ways in which aco providers can, within legal and regulatory restraints, actively coordinate and/or partner with part d plans.\nextreme and uncontrollable circumstances accommodation\nin previous rule making, cms established polices for how to address quality performance, scoring, and any financial reconciliation for acos that were affected by \u00e2\u0080\u009cextreme and uncontrollable circumstances\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 namely the 2017 california wildfires and hurricanes harvey, irma, maria, and nate.  cms finalized a policy that would be applied if 20 percent or more of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficiaries resided in an emergency declared area as determined under the qpp or if the apm entity is located in such an area. now, cms is proposing to extend this policy to performance year 2018 and subsequent years.  cms also is proposing to apply these policies to the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality reporting period; if an aco is unable to submit data to cms, the agency would not be able to measure the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance. however, cms may opt not to include the quality-reporting period under the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy if the quality reporting period is extended.  cms indicated this would provide the aco with an additional opportunity to submit quality data, making additional accommodations superfluous.\nregarding the quality-reporting period, amga would ask that cms provide clarification on how the agency would determine and announce whether the extreme and uncontrollable polices are governing, or if the reporting period will be extended.  cms notes the possibility of extending the reporting period in both this proposed rule and the december 2017 interim final rule with a comment period that originally established the policies for assessing the financial and quality performance of mssp acos affected by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances.  however, cms is silent on when or why the reporting period would be extended.  before moving forward with this policy, cms should explain its decision making process.\nshould cms make a determination that an aco is facing extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, it is proposing the following.\nthe aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minimum quality score would be set to equal the mean quality performance score for all shared savings program acos for the applicable performance year.\nthe higher of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance score or the mean quality performance score for all shared savings program acos would be used for acos that are able to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompletely and accurately report all quality measures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d if the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance score is used, the aco also would be eligible for quality improvement points.\nif the aco receives the mean shared savings program quality performance score, the aco would not be eligible for bonus points awarded based on quality improvement during the applicable performance year.\nif an aco receives the mean shared savings program aco quality performance score for a performance year, in the next performance year for which the aco reports quality data and receives a quality performance score based on its own performance, cms would measure quality improvement based on a comparison between the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance in that year and in the most recently available prior performance year in which the aco reported quality.\nregarding determining the benchmark of an area affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance, cms considered adjusting the benchmark to account for disasters that occur during a benchmark year.  however, cms opted instead to rely on its regional adjustment factor policy to account for any variations in expenditures.  cms is seeking comment on this proposal.  we would refer cms to our comments on the problems with the regional blend.  absent a reform that addresses the underlying issue with the regional adjustment factor, applying it to acos in a region recovering from an extreme or uncontrollable circumstance will perpetuate the flaws.\nwe thank cms for consideration of our comments.  should you have questions please do not hesitate to contact amga's david introcaso, ph.d., senior director of public policy at (703) 842.0774 or at

[cms-1701-p]\n dear administrator verma,\n i am writing to oppose a few key aspects of the recent centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) proposed \"pathways to success\" rule on the medicare shared savings program.\n we ask that cms change the proposed implementation plans for the regional cost adjustment.\n 1) starting date for regional cost adjustments.\n we agree with the cms comment that benchmarking methodology that incorporates regional expenditures is important for the sustainability of the program.\n as a 2013 starting aco, we have had relatively low benchmarks compared to our high cost region. when selecting the providers for our aco, we mistakenly thought that selecting highly efficient and high- quality providers would be the formula for success. instead, we have had to deal with patients who self- refer themselves to outside specialists with very high utilization parameters, and use relatively high cost hospitals, which degrades our cost advantage. our benchmark has averaged $2000-$3000 below our region from 2013 to 2016.  despite this better-than-average performance, we have been able to obtain a shared savings bonus in only one out of five performance years.\n we are a small, physician owned and operated aco, and we felt that the regional cost adjustment would significantly help our ability to provide the necessary oversight to accelerate our efforts to reduce costs. we are very thinly capitalized, as we are not subsidized by any hospitals. we would have preferred to enter the regional cost adjustment prior to the expiration of our contract at the end of 2018, and we requested permission to do so but were denied. we then focused on starting the regional cost adjustment at the beginning of 2019 with the initiation of a new contract.\n we now find that due to delays in formulating the new aco rules, the regional cost adjustment implementation for our aco is now pushed back further to july 2019.\n this is a significant financial disadvantage for any aco that is performing better than their region, but particularly disadvantages us because of the delay in the implementation of these rules.\n we ask that cms allow renewing acos with 2013 or 2016 start years that are forced to use a six months extension to have a regional cost adjustment as originally planned, during the six-month performance year january 1, 2019 to june 30, 2019.\n there is nothing in the methodology specified for the six-month performance years that would prohibit the inclusion of a regional cost adjustment to the benchmark for that six-month performance year from january 1, 2019 through june 30, 2019.\n in your proposed rule you discuss considering allowing for incorporation of regional expenditures even in the first agreement. we will be entering our seventh year in the medicare shared savings program without the incorporation of any regional cost adjustment. providing this adjustment starting in january 2019 will assist all similar acos in sustaining our programs and allow us to implement further measures to drive further cost reductions.\n 2) limitation on regional cost adjustment\n cms is now proposing a limitation on the regional cost adjustments for the second agreement to be capped at 50% of the spending difference rather than 70%.\n additionally, cms is proposing capping the amount of the regional adjustment based on a percentage of national ffs expenditures.\n the rationale for this is elusive. common sense would suggest that cms should maximally incentivize aco organizations capable of driving costs significantly below current levels. to cap this regional adjustment will reduce the incentive to drive costs lower.\n in the discussion of this cap, higher levels of adjustments were referred to as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwindfall gain\u00e2\u0080\u009d. our opinion of this terminology is that it is unfortunate and somewhat offensive. the acos have been working diligently, often with little hope of a bonus every year, to drive costs lower. in our aco, we have been working for last four years to maintain lower costs in a high cost area in the hope that we may have an adequate regional adjustment in the future.  if we have a significant regional adjustment, it will not be by accident, and it will not be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwindfall\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n we ask that cms eliminate the proposed limitation on the regional cost adjustment.\n sincerely,\n\n amarillo legacy medical aco 1215 s. coulter street, ste 400 amarillo, texas 79106\n seema verma administrator centers for medicare &

verma,\n i am writing to oppose a few key aspects of the recent centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) proposed \"pathways to success\" rule on the medicare shared savings program.\n we ask that cms re-evaluate their proposed methodology for determining high revenue vs low revenue to assist small physician led acos, particularly those in less populated areas such as ours, to afford to enter into an at-risk arrangement.\n rationale:  the reason for this rule was to be inclusive of small physician owned and operated aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in downside risk tracks, and exclude large hospital based acos.  it is fatally flawed, as demonstrated by our own aco results.\n we are a small, physician owned and operated aco, but we are inappropriately categorized as \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the proposed methodology. we do not have any institutional providers as a participant. we do not command any greater ability to coordinate care across settings for our assigned beneficiaries by being categorized as \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n using the proposed calculation of participants total medicare ffs expenditures vs assigned beneficiaries ffs expenditures is invalid for acos that serve rural areas that surround small cities as is the case with our aco.\n here is why.\n your proposal assumes that the service area for the aco participants total medicare revenue is identical to the service area for the aco assigned beneficiaries. this would allow you to identify aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with hospital involvement because the hospital would provide a large monetary amount of care for that service area compared to an aco with physicians only, in that same service area.\n groups, are the only available specialists for a five-state area that includes the texas panhandle, oklahoma, kansas, new mexico, and southeast colorado. they are the exclusive providers for subspecialty care for many specialties for these areas, because there are simply no other large cities within driving distance for residents of these rural areas.\n thus, we are comparing the practice income for medical groups that include the specialists that serve five states, against a pcp aco beneficiary population base drawn from a small 200,000 population city.\n we are not providing any hospital services, however some of our specialists, such as rheumatologists, provide infusion services which have very high part b medicare costs. these services have a very thin margin, and certainly not a margin high enough to support any expansion of aco services, or to pay for downside risk insurance. the profit margin on these services is infinitesimally small, but when considering that we are the sole provider for these services for a five-state area this inflates our total medicare ffs income to a point where we are now deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n the current proposal clearly disadvantages non-hospital acos

other aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will be similarly disadvantaged, and it is unlikely that ours is the only aco to be in this situation.\n we do not see any indication from your table 3 on page 41808 that cms considered the number of acos that would have moved from \u00e2\u0080\u009crevenue based loss sharing limit\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbenchmark based loss sharing limit\u00e2\u0080\u009d when changing to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cuse of claims\u00e2\u0080\u009d for this determination. your text seems to imply that the percentage of aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s would be similar using either method, and that could be true. it was not clear if cms addressed the fact that there are going to be acos moving in both directions, and while the overall totals happen to be similar, the process is not necessarily improved. in reality, there are going to be some acos that are mis-categorized in both directions, and your proposed methodology seems to be making this worse rather than better.\n we suggest several potential alternatives. the most reasonable would be to simply eliminate the whole category of \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d since the methods of categorizing \u00e2\u0080\u009clow\u00e2\u0080\u009d vs \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d are fraught with problems. it would not be inherently unfair to allow all level e acos to have a lower risk cap. for aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that owe any repayment, most of them will owe repayments that fall within the lower limits. cms has the capacity to exclude lower performing acos that exceed the risk-sharing limits, and we would expect cms to use that capability if limits are exceeded.\n alternatively, since cms knows the taxpayer identification number (tin) of all of our aco participants, it should be a relatively simple matter to cross reference the tin to identify acos who are hospitals and assign those aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh

accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success. the department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to improve interoperability and better serve medicare and medicaid patients runs parallel to ochin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals and has widespread impact on our national healthcare delivery system. ochin is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit community-based health information technology collaborative based in portland, oregon. ochin receives support from the u.s. department of health and human services through grants under the health resources and services administration (hrsa), and is a hrsa- designated health center-controlled network (hccn). ochin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission is to pioneer the use of health information technology in caring for the medically underserved. as such, ochin serves community health centers (chcs), including federally qualified health centers (fqhcs), rural and school-based health centers, safety-net providers and public health and corrections facilities across the nation. ochin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments are based on our experiences with the members we serve. ochin appreciates the opportunity to comment, focusing on two overarching issues: the first, metric alignment, and the second, health information exchange between state policy and federal policy.\n\n 1881 sw naito parkway, portland, or 97201    |    t: 503.943.2500    |

providing full transparency. transparency can be achieved by allowing entities and providers access to their clinic and claims data to understand the complexity of some of the patients they are undertaking, and the consequences of serving more complex patients. without giving providers the opportunity to analyze their own costs, it is difficult to impose such risk upon them. as such, ochin applauds cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to continue to expand access to medicare and medicaid claims data to be able to understand total cost of care on an aggregated basis for safety net providers. ochin highly supports the inclusion of the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home in originating sites for covered telehealth services. ideally, any location of the patient during the time of telehealth service should be covered, where the service can provide similar results to an in-person visit. we also support removing the geographic limitation which would allow patients to access specialists regardless of location. ochin agrees with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment that it will lower costs, improve quality, and better engage beneficiaries in their care. we further support the additional protections of beneficiaries in the case of telehealth services supplied by a non-assigned aco and then charged as a non-covered service. reimbursement provisions continue to be one of the larger remaining obstacle to widespread telehealth utilization. for this reason, ochin highly supports the revision which includes the home of a beneficiary in the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009coriginating site\u00e2\u0080\u009d in section 1834(m) and the removal of the geographic limitation. ochin supports the exchange of the ehr quality measure (aco-11) for a cehrt standard. ochin suggests aligning cehrt state and federal requirements across the board, requiring all providers to adopt 2015 or higher cehrt for program participation. fulfilling the complete onboarding of all providers onto 2015 or higher cehrt allows patients to access complete and coordinated care, regardless of location. this achieves the interoperability sought by cms if providers enable carequality or commonwell, or other national frameworks. requiring providers to enable one of these national frameworks would overcome persistent data blocking efforts. those entities not yet operating on 2015 or higher cehrt likely face cost barriers. financial assistance from cms will help complete their onboarding process and achieve interoperability. we thank you for your time and consideration of our comments on the medicare

administrator verma,\r\ni write in opposition to a few key aspects of the recent cms proposed \"pathways to success\" rule on the medicare shared savings program, in particular the agency's proposal to cut accountable care organizations' (acos') shared savings rates below 50 percent, reduce the time in a shared savings-only model from six to two years, and introduce early termination policies based on spending that is slightly higher than benchmarks. i urge cms to modify the proposed application of a +/- 3 percent risk adjustment cap across an extended agreement period by increasing that to +/- 5 percent. additionally, acos bearing any amount of downside risk should receive a higher savings rate than the initial aco track 1 50 percent upside only model. specifically, i recommend level e of the basic track sharing rate be increased to 60 percent of savings.\r\nthe move from basic level e to the enhanced track is too aggressive in risk and there should be a more gradual path from e to enhanced. primary partners recommends incorporating a revenue based risk cap to the enhanced track similar to the basic level e track and proposes the cap be increased in the same proportion the upside savings rate is increased, by 50 percent, resulting in a maximum downside payment cap of 12 percent of participants fee-for-service revenue.\r\nthese proposed changes will harm patients and providers by limiting improvements in savings and quality acos provide, while slowing progress made in transitioning to value-base payments.\r\non the other hand, i support a number of proposals in the rule and encourage cms to finalize its proposals to: 1) move to five-year agreement periods; 2) introduce a more gradual glidepath to risk and make the track 1+ equivalent (basic level e) permanent; 3) reduce burdens related to quality reporting; 4) expand the use of waivers for telehealth and skilled nursing facility stays; and 5) provide flexibility with choosing assignment methodology regardless of risk model.\r\nwhile primary partners supports the expansion of waivers and the beneficiary incentive program, we urge cms to add additional patient engagement tools to acos, such as allowing acos to develop networks of preferred providers and offer discounts and other incentives to patients using such preferred providers, and we request cms fund the $20 payments to eligible beneficiaries who receive qualifying (primary care) services.\r\nwe support introducing regional expenditures in the initial agreement period, but oppose reducing the maximum amount of regional expenditures and recommend staying with a 70 percent max. we recommend cms use a +/- 7 percent range to control outliers and to remove aco beneficiaries from regional reference population rather than pursue using a national-regional blended trend rate.\r\nwe support cms efforts to improve transparency and predictability and ask cms to improve quarterly reporting so acos are more capable of predicting total spend against benchmarks and avoid the large swings that come during reconciliation. we ask cms to share all claims data including substance abuse and mental health claims. for those beneficiaries who decline data sharing, we recommend their total spend be removed from an aco's total cost since there is less ability to manage and no transparency into these beneficiaries' total cost of care. we support cms agencies working together and further recommend the medicare shared savings program work with the quality payment program regarding the advanced alternative payment model (aapm) for the 5 percent aapm bonus payments to be paid to the aco entity on behalf of the participants.\r\nprimary partners was one of the first acos in the country to participate in the program in 2012 as a1011. soon thereafter, we started a second aco, a1481. with the support of the advanced payment funding to build the infrastructure, both acos achieved success in the program, generating a combined $12.1 million in savings in 2015 and achieving the highest quality score in florida 2014-2015, coming in fourth in the nation in 2014. it took us three years to identify a strategy that worked for both improving quality, satisfaction and generating cost efficiencies. unfortunately since we did not receive these tremendous results until september 2016, we decided to drop out of the program for the 2016-2017 performance years. had we a better indication of our overall performance before we had to make a decision to continue or term, we would have remained in the program and continued to generate greater success. we have since re-entered the aco program for the 2018 performance year as a3646, a track 1+ aco. we previously advocated for recognition as a continuing aco and to allow regional benchmarks in the first performance year. although this has not yet benefited our aco, we are pleased to see cms is incorporating these suggestions in their

use files. the 2017 financial results for the mssp program, however, paint a much different picture and call into question the necessity of many of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals. our analysis of the 2017 financial results (shown above) in fact demonstrates that the 433 track 1 acos on average spent less relative to their financial benchmarks, resulting in a net savings to medicare of almost $310 million.  these more recent results are driven in large part by the financial turnaround of the 2014 track 1 cohort, which reversed its financial results from a net loss of $77 million in 2016 to a net savings of $167 million in 2017. this very significant turnaround is likely a result of acos voluntarily dropping out of the program while acos continuing in the program benefited from additional time for their clinical improvement and operational activities to generate program savings. these results clearly show that acos in one-sided risk models, given sufficient time, can generate medicare savings. it is also not surprising that low revenue acos (generally physician group led) acos would generate savings faster than high revenue acos (generally hospital-integrated acos), as high revenue acos are more complex organizations requiring additional time to implement the clinical improvement activities and operational efficiencies necessary to generate savings under the mssp. results from 2017 argue that high revenue acos need more rather than less time in one-sided risk models to be successful moving forward.  limiting participation options using the seemingly arbitrary high/low revenue distinction likely would drive out the acos that cms most likely wants to attract and retain for their increased potential to generate significant savings to the program over time. our detailed comments below highlight a number of aspects of the proposed rule that could undermine the ability of aco participants to achieve long-term success in the program, $62 $54

high revenue distinction for determining participation options cms proposes to define participation options by making a distinction between low revenue acos and high revenue acos. cms notes in its proposed rule that high revenue acos,\n(i.e., a proxy for acos that typically include a hospital billing through an aco participant tin), \n 5\n 6\n use of regional factors when establishing and resetting aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmarks we generally support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals to incorporate the use of regional factors when establishing and resetting acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benchmarks. this includes incorporating regional factors into the benchmarking methodology for acos in the first agreement period, limiting the magnitude of the regional adjustment, and incorporating the national-regional blend trend factors. this helps alleviate concerns that more efficient acos operating in low-cost markets could potentially have a lower benchmark and reduced opportunity for shared savings than a less efficient aco with a higher benchmark operating in a high cost area. with the incorporation of regional blends, aco benchmarks would be more reflective of broader regional fee-for-service (ffs) spending in each aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market. gradually incorporating regional data into benchmarks would better account for the patient population characteristics of a specific aco. we also support the approach cms proposes to phase-in the regional adjustment based on the agreement period. monitoring for financial performance cms proposes additional provisions to address an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial performance when an aco may otherwise be in compliance with program requirements. cms states that just as poor quality performance can subject an aco to remedial action or termination, an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to lower growth in medicare ffs expenditures should be the basis for cms to take pre-termination actions under 42. c.f.r. \u00e2\u00a7425.216, including a request for corrective action by the aco, or termination of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement under 42 c.f.r. \u00e2\u00a7425.218.   cms appears to be particularly concerned about one-sided risk acos that continue to participate in the program and generate net losses to medicare.\n the fah disagrees with the necessity of these additional provisions that, if implemented, would provide cms with too much discretion to terminate aco participation in the program. the 2017 mssp financials results suggest that acos that are performing poorly drop out of the program voluntarily so that poor financial performance is a self-correcting issue, even for participants in the one-sided risk tracks. this broad authority being claimed by cms would further discourage acos (particularly those with complex organizational structures, including hospitals) from participating in the mssp, as this would create even more financial uncertainty for participants and make it more difficult to establish collaborative relationships with other organizations.  moreover, cms proposals with respect to the glide path that would limit participation in one-sided risk models would also provide acos with incentives to leave the program if they were not able to generate sufficient savings that would help them recoup the substantial investments needed to be successful in this program.\n 7\n 8\n 9\n interactions across the various alternative payment models, especially when population/total cost-of care programs overlap with more narrowly- focused, bundled payment episodes.  entities providing bundled episodes are incentivized to keep single beneficiary episode costs low but not to limit episode volumes per beneficiary, while the aco to which that beneficiary is assigned would be accountable for all of the episodes while reaping only part, if any, of the single episode savings. cms has created precedence rules for some of its overlapping initiatives (e.g., bpci-original episodes took precedence over similar cjr episodes), but many overlap scenarios remain unaddressed.  few data are available about the extent of model overlap and its impact upon model success.  precedence guidance is scattered across the various rules addressing specific models rather than available in a single user-friendly source.  no set of overarching principles to guide decisions about handling overlaps has been explicitly articulated.  inconsistent, unpredictable, and hard-to-find precedence guidance disproportionately affects acos compared to other models, since aco assigned beneficiaries can be eligible for inclusion in multiple models simultaneously.  identifying and managing overlap scenarios is burdensome for acos and impedes efficient operations.  the fah recommends that cms provide in the final mssp aco rule a comprehensive table of precedence rules for shared savings program aco interactions with all of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bundled payment episode programs; articulate a set of principles applicable to decision-making about existing and future overlap situations; and create a webpage on which all overlap situations and their relevant precedence materials are easily located and regularly updated. recognizing the value in assisting beneficiaries in identifying and choosing high quality care in recent years, cms has increasingly recognized the importance and value of preferred provider networks in care coordinated models. yet, and within all coordinated care models, cms is continuing to require that participants develop preferred provider networks within the constraints created by current law.  the fah urges that such patient choice constraints be waived to truly effect change under care coordination models, like the mssp. while we believe that patient choice must continue to be respected, we also believe that mssp participants simply require additional flexibility above and beyond that currently permitted. current patient choice requirements may not only serve to confuse beneficiaries, they also limit the ability of, in the case of mssp, an aco to assist a beneficiary in identifying the highest quality care or providers actively engaged in care coordination efforts.\n\n", "0366": "attached are the comments on the proposed rule from caravan health.\n\n\n\n\n\n october 16, 2018\n\n submitted

organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success; proposed rule rin 0938-at45\n\n dear administrator verma:\n caravan health appreciates the opportunity to comment on the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) proposed rule on the shared savings program (ssp). as a national leader in successful accountable care and population health programs for community health systems, we have a strong interest in the future of this program. we welcome cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to improve the ssp, and its focus on ensuring that accountable care organizations (acos) achieve high performance in serving medicare beneficiaries. acos have already demonstrated significant improvement in quality and cost reduction both for attributed beneficiaries and others and can do still better in the future.1\n maintaining a healthy aco program will improve the quality of care received by medicare beneficiaries and the sustainability of the medicare trust fund. acos are the most cost-effective payment arrangement when compared to traditional fee-for-service medicare and medicare advantage. accordingly, cms should continue encouraging participation in acos when consistent with good performance, quality, efficiency, and program integrity.\n caravan health generally supports the ssp proposed rule.  we suggest some improvements to the proposed rule, which we summarize here before further detailing below:\n 1) encouraging and even requiring health care providers to take risk brings a helpful attention and discipline to any payment model. however, certain providers, including safety net and rural, may never be able to take downside risk without jeopardizing solvency and patient care.  we urge cms to preserve no-risk participation (similar to the current track 1) for acos with rural and safety net providers. the risk level of the proposed enhanced track is impossible for many providers and it should be optional for all but the\n\n\n\nwww.caravanhealth.com 2 \n largest and best-funded acos.  and for all providers, the program is barely break- even during the early years, so cms should not reduce the sharing rate below 50%.\n\n 2) rural health clinic and federally qualified health center providers are not eligible for any medicare quality incentives outside of the medicare ssp, including mips and medicare meaningful use. this makes the ssp the largest and most effective quality advancement program in rural health care today, with approximately 70 acos serving more than one million medicare beneficiaries in rural areas. notably, rural beneficiaries see providers whose payment is not generally affected by mips, the hospital valued-based purchasing program, or other medicare quality improvement programs. caravan health-supported rural aco participants experience, on average, an increase of 15 points in quality scores in the first year of participation, a direct correlation to additional preventive care and screenings that those patients would not receive outside of this model. we ask cms to preserve this program for the safety net by continuing to support small and rural hospitals in the final rule.\n 3) under the initial program rulemaking, cms established the minimum savings and loss rates (msr/mlr) as a function of aco size and a desired confidence interval of 90 percent. as described below, cms appears to have miscalculated, and created thresholds that were closer to 75 percent - meaning far too many acos receive shared savings payments based on random chance; it will also result in many acos writing checks to cms based on chance as more acos move into risk. over time, this will drive large numbers of acos out of the program for factors other than performance and will result in inefficiency for both cms and providers. this is inimical to good culture for performance improvement, as many acos overrate their own performance based on the random variation that pushed them over the savings threshold.  cms should consider widening the msr and mlr thresholds to protect acos and medicare against paying \u00e2\u0080\u009crandom losses\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009crandom winnings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n caravan health also makes several suggestions to reduce the regulatory burden on health care providers and to improve the methodology for calculation of regional benchmarks.\n \u00e2\u009e\u00a2 cms should maintain a healthy aco program by ensuring the availability of a no-risk aco option for rural providers\n while caravan health is generally supportive of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed basic and enhanced option acos and believes that many acos participating in the program are prepared to enter risk-bearing arrangements, we encourage cms to create a new option for rural and safety net providers. cms should allow acos that are solely comprised of safety net providers to participate in the basic track level a with 50 percent shared savings indefinitely as long as they are improving quality and are not increasing costs, as judged by the 99 percent confidence interval (see figure 3 below). experience shows us that these providers can and will succeed but operating in a rural market means these organizations have limited resources and no ability to absorb downside risk without jeopardizing patient care. nearly fifty percent of rural hospitals annually lose money on operations. in such an environment, it is implausible to expect rural providers to enter into a program that requires them to potentially pay back significant sums to cms.\n\n\n\nwww.caravanhealth.com 3 \n funding from cms in 2015 and 2016. this cohort of mostly rural providers in track 1 saved more per capita than track 3 acos for the 2017 performance year even without downside risk2. cms should allow these acos to continue these promising results without increasing the level of risk.\n\n\n summary of 2017 financial and quality information savings per capita percent savings total savings shared savings number of beneficiaries average quality aco investment model (aim) $172 1.6% $81m $38m 470,000 94% track 3 $138 1.3% $111m $93m 805,000 95%\n rural acos have also performed well compared with the next generation (nextgen) acos. nextgen began operation in 2016 as a way for experienced medicare acos to take on greater risk along with the ability to better manage their enrolled populations. in their first year, aim acos saved medicare\n$22.70 per beneficiary per month. in comparison, the risk-bearing nextgen acos saved $18.20 \n pbpm. net of shared savings, cms saved $20 pbpm in aim, and $11.20 pbpm in nextgen3. the number show that downside risk is not required for rural acos to achieve results.\n with these data in mind, caravan health urges cms to consider a no-risk option in the ssp, available only to rural providers and other safety net providers.\n \u00e2\u009e\u00a2 cms must calibrate the risk requirements of both tracks carefully and should not reduce the sharing rate below 50%\n we agree that for most providers, a steady progression from no-risk to moderate downside risk over a five-year period is appropriate. many of caravan health\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clients from suburban and urban areas were already planning to transition to a limited risk model in coming years before the release of the proposed rule and will be able to follow that strategy if the rule is finalized as proposed.\n despite the benefits of a moderate amount of risk, the level of risk in the enhanced track is excessive. the cost of reinsurance makes the 15 percent maximum downside risk level in the enhanced track option too high for most providers to consider, as demonstrated already by the limited take-up of the current track 3. the proposed enhanced track risk translates to as much as $1,500 per patient in a typical aco. based on caravan health\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discussions with reinsurers, an aco can expect to spend anywhere from $50 - $200 per patient per year to reinsure that risk. covering that cost each year would require savings in excess of 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 4 percent every year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 figures that are not consistently achievable. even if those savings were achievable, it is inappropriate for such a large share of medicare funding to be redirected from patient care and towards overhead activities and financial institutions.\n preliminary analysis of caravan health\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rural hospital clients suggests that nearly all will be classified as \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning all would be required to take 15 percent downside risk within\n\n\n\nwww.caravanhealth.com 4 \n five years. as previously described, the limited risk under basic level e has proved too large for most rural providers. so, while 15 percent downside risk may be a valuable option for those larger organizations that can tolerate it, cms should not have as a policy goal pushing all organizations into risk they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sustain.\n in addition, for all providers, the program is barely break-even during the early years, so cms should not reduce the sharing rate below 50%. if cms is concerned about payments due to \u00e2\u0080\u009crandom winnings\u00e2\u0080\u009d it can address that problem with larger risk corridors \u00e2\u0080\u0093 reducing the overall attractiveness of the business model will result in lower incentives to reduce medicare spending and to meet the aco program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality measure objectives.\n\n \u00e2\u009e\u00a2 cms should base msr/mlrs on 99 percent confidence intervals varying with aco size\n\n caravan health\u00e2\u0080\u0099s small and rural aco clients have achieved excellent clinical quality scores above national averages even as they beat their spending benchmarks. however, the natural year-over- year variation in performance and risk of paying back shared losses even in a single year is too much uncertainty for providers that live on the margins. all acos require a sufficient number of covered lives to manage variation in health care spending. put simply, smaller organizations experience less predictable results than than those with more attributed lives. earlier this year, caravan health published data showing the variation in results from 2013 to 2016 based on aco size4.  this first chart shows the annual savings and losses of all acos plotted against number of patient lives. the second chart shows the year-over-year change in savings and losses in acos by size.\n\n figure 1: aco performance vs benchmark 2013 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2016 performance years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.caravanhealth.com 5 \n figure 2: change in aco performance vs benchmark year\u00e2\u0080\u0093over\u00e2\u0080\u0093year 2013 - 2016\n\n\n the charts make the relationship clear \u00e2\u0080\u0093 smaller acos have much less control over the level of savings or losses they experience each year for reasons outside their control. these acos can be doing everything right and still not realize savings due to the inherent unpredictability of year- over-year health care costs. this problem is not solved by pushing acos into risk-bearing tracks; in fact, the inherent variability of medicare spending means that small acos will inevitably write checks to cms based on a bad year, driving many organizations out of the program.\n figure 3: confidence intervals for savings rates in the mssp based on 2014-2015 medicare claims vs aco attributed lives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.caravanhealth.com 6 \n the current minimum savings/loss rates were based on confidence intervals of 90 percent (as described by cms in the initial ssp rulemaking) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but in experience the level of confidence has been closer to 75 percent (see figure 3). that level of confidence is insufficient protection for both the aco and the government \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it allows for too great a probability of writing checks for shared savings or losses based on chance. if those corridors were widened, acos would have some more breathing room for these inevitable swings, while still working toward better population health and shared savings. those could be increased (or widened) to 99 percent level of confidence to create more integrity behind shared savings or losses.\n our analysis shows that some providers are receiving shared savings checks with low confidence that they are actually earned. as structured, these risk corridors could mislead providers into thinking they are prepared for risk, when it is actually random chance that can lead to savings checks. unfortunately, the same statistical chance comes into play when they enter downside risk and may end up owing money due to the same noise in the data. as the saying goes, failure is an orphan and success has many parents; when providers find themselves having to cut a check to cms that they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explain, they may drop out of the program rather than take a chance of more bad statistical luck. this kind of program distortion can exact real damage on relatively new program, especially one that is optional for participants.\n we recommend that cms take a different approach to risk corridors.  as stated above, at a baseline, providers should have 99 percent confidence that any savings or losses are real. as an alternative, acos should be permitted to choose symmetrical risk corridors within a narrow range between 90 and 99 percent. cms should also educate acos about statistical factors that drive variation in aco performance that are outside of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control, and what we have learned since the program began operation.\n \u00e2\u009e\u00a2 cms should encourage the success of hospital-based acos\n we are concerned that the proposed rule establishes a revenue distinction between high-revenue and low-revenue acos that is too low. we recommend that cms increase the cutoff from 25 percent to 40 percent or greater for this and any future standards in which cms seeks to distinguish small and large health systems.\n as medpac described in its june 2018 report, hospital-based acos have achieved savings for the medicare program and most acos, whether hospital-affiliated or not, have derived the most savings from post-acute care, not inpatient hospital services.5  based on our preliminary analysis of our largely rural hospitals, nearly all rural acos including rural hospitals are classified as \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning they will eventually be required to take very significant risk or leave the program.\n there is good reason to encourage the development of hospital-based acos. in its report, medpac points to the fact that hospitals have greater financial resources than clinician groups and nearly half of risk-bearing ssp acos include hospitals providers. due to these factors, medpac concludes that \u00e2\u0080\u009cit may be important for hospital-based acos to thrive to make two-sided aco models more available.\u00e2\u0080\u009d in other words, the success of acos overall is tied to the success of hospital acos.\n\n\n\n\nwww.caravanhealth.com 7 \n \u00e2\u009e\u00a2 cms should maintain flexibility for aco participants to implement waiver programs as locally appropriate\n caravan health is intrigued by cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed beneficiary incentive program and believes it is a promising tool for aco participants. as cms provides future guidance on this and other shared savings waiver programs, we urge cms to maintain flexibility for acos to implement them on a participant level, as appropriate for their area and patient population.\n while we agree it is helpful for the aco to apply for waiver programs as a collective to ensure the aco board is involved in the required decision-making, participants within an aco often operate in different environments that are not served well by a one-size-fits-all approach. this will be especially true in the case of the beneficiary incentive program where aco participants may want to assign different incentive amounts based upon their region.\n to be effective, caravan health believes there must be flexibility for acos to adopt waiver programs that may be implemented, within specified guidelines, on an individual basis by the aco participants. in the absence of such flexibility, independent providers in convened acos will be at a disadvantage relative to large consolidated systems, and cms will inadvertently contribute to the pressure for health care providers to consolidate.\n \u00e2\u009e\u00a2 cms should eliminate patient cost-sharing for primary care and care management services provided within an aco\n as mentioned above, caravan health sees significant promise in the proposed beneficiary incentive program. we encourage cms to explore additional tools like the beneficiary incentive program; tools to encourage patients to seek and receive preventative and care management services that lower costs and reduce unnecessary utilization. in particular, we urge cms to consider options that would eliminate patient cost-sharing for primary care and care management services.\n in our work with ssp acos, we coach the value of annual wellness visits and chronic care management to successfully improving the quality and lowering the cost of care. we have seen that these strategies work and yield savings to cms. however, the administrative hassle of collecting co- payments for chronic care management leads many providers to simply not offer the service. for providers that continue to offer the service, they face the uphill battle of collecting the required co- payment without damaging the patient-provider relationship.\n caravan health encourages cms to propose a policy whereby any service included as part of the ssp attribution is paid in full by cms. such a policy would go a long way towards engaging patients as well as improving overall health outcomes. acos and other alternative payment models have created the right incentives for providers to emphasize primary care and wellness over sick care. we believe cms must now align the incentives for medicare beneficiaries by removing cost-sharing from those services that have been demonstrated to lower the total cost of care.\n \u00e2\u009e\u00a2 caravan supports proposed changes to the benchmark methodology and encourages cms to further address rural acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 disproportionate share in regional benchmarks\n\n\n\nwww.caravanhealth.com 8 \n weight the updates to the regional benchmark in inverse proportion to its market share, would not in any way address the poor incentive created by the current calculation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that the better an aco performs, the more it reduces its regional benchmark, effectively reducing the opportunity for future savings. cms should address this most directly by expanding the size of the regions for acos that are large relative to their regions as it does when setting medicare advantage benchmarks.\n in other proposed changes, we are pleased that cms is finally acknowledging that many providers experience changes in the risk profile of their patients during aco participation, leading to patient risk scores that may either increase or decrease during benchmark re-basing. because acos may experience changes in the population that affect the risk score by more than 1 percent per year, we recommend that cms increase the cap on changes in hcc score over an agreement period to +/- 5 percent.\n \u00e2\u009e\u00a2 proposed new beneficiary notification requirements would create major new regulatory burden\n caravan health is strongly opposed to the new beneficiary notification requirement proposed by\ncms. not only is this new requirement extremely burdensome, but this exact type of notification \n has already been tried by cms and rightly rejected.\n when cms first began its aco experiment with pioneer acos in 2012, those acos were required to mail a beneficiary notification strikingly similar to the requirement now proposed for the ssp acos. cms quickly replaced the mailing requirement with the current poster and notice to patients (see 42 cfr \u00e2\u00a7 425.312) after the letter was deemed confusing to beneficiaries and extremely burdensome and costly for acos to implement.\n cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal is particularly confounding in light of the already robust process in place. cms currently requires aco participants to post the aco poster in all of their facilities and make the notice to patients available in all primary care settings. these notices are required to be on a cms template, to which cms makes minor changes every year. the hassle of keeping up with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new templates and replacing posters present in every aco facility is already quite burdensome and costly to participants. cms provides no evidence that the posters and notices are not working and proposes to add a third, even more burdensome requirement, without modification of the existing\ntwo.  \n\n if cms feels strongly that beneficiaries should know when they are attributed to an aco, then as the holder of claims data that is a function cms should undertake. the proposed cost-shifting to providers is excessive given their participation in the aco so they can reduce wasteful spending, not contribute to it.\n\n \u00e2\u009e\u00a2 cms should maintain aco-11 through performance year 2019 before moving to cehrt attestation\n while caravan health is ultimately supportive of the change from aco-11 to annual cehrt attestation, given the timing of this rule, we believe cms should delay the transition until the start of performance year 2020.\n\n\n\nwww.caravanhealth.com 9 \n months earlier, on january 1, 2019. the late release of the ssp proposed rule means participants with a twelve-month 2019 performance year will have only weeks before the new policy. this is not enough time for those acos to make basic preparations, including surveys to determine their current cehrt versions and percent meeting the required cehrt standard. without this information acos are forced to enter the year with the possibility of non-compliance with a key cms requirement.\n caravan health urges cms to delay the transition to cehrt attestation until the start of performance year 2020 so as not to inadvertently penalize track 1 acos that have not had time to conduct this analysis. alternatively, we ask that cms specify that the attestation requirement is effective only for aco performance years beginning july 1, 2019 or thereafter.\n\n

of the american college of emergency physicians (acep) and our 38,000 members, thank you for the opportunity to share our comments on the medicare shared savings program proposed rule. october 16, 2018 seema verma, mph    re: cms-1701-p administrator centers for medicare & medicaid services department of health and human services po box 8013 baltimore, md 21244-1850 re: medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations--pathways to success dear administrator verma: on behalf of over 39,000 members of the american college of emergency physicians (acep), we greatly appreciate the opportunity to provide our comments on the medicare shared savings program (shared savings program) proposed rule. emergency physicians play a vital role in their communities, serving as safety net providers who care for people at their greatest time of need. as they treat each patient, emergency physicians must make the critical decision about whether the patient should be kept for observation, admitted to the hospital, or discharged. fundamentally, they act as a gateway to the hospital for many patients. emergency physicians are therefore in a prime position to be meaningful participants in alternative payment models (apms). however, while many emergency physicians are ready to take on downside risk and participate in advanced apms, there simply are not any opportunities to do so. anecdotally, we have heard that a limited number of emergency physicians participate indirectly in the shared savings program. while emergency physicians could possibly be part of a larger physician group or hospital participating in the shared savings program or another accountable care organization (aco) model, emergency physicians do not play an active role in these initiatives. transition to downside risk even though the participation of emergency physicians in the shared savings program is currently limited, we do wish to comment on a few issues, including cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to transition acos to downside risk on a more aggressive timeline. under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal, acos that choose to participate in the basic track would not be exposed to any downside risk for only two years (in the current program, acos can be in track 1 for up to six years). these acos would also have limited risk for the remainder of their five-year agreement period. cms also creates the concept of \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos, which would likely primarily be physician-based acos. these low-revenue acos could spend up to two 5-year agreement periods in the basic track before proceeding to the enhanced track.\n as we attempt to shift our health care system to one that rewards value over volume, acep believes that physicians, along with other providers, can start to become more accountable for the cost and quality of care they furnish. on september 6, acep presented a physician-focused payment model called the acute unscheduled care model (aucm): enhancing appropriate admissions to the physician-focused payment model technical advisory committee (ptac) for consideration. the ptac voted in favor of recommending the model to the hhs secretary for full implementation. structured as a bundled payment model, the aucm will improve quality and reduce costs in medicare by allowing emergency physicians to accept some financial risk for the decisions they make around discharges for certain episodes of acute unscheduled care. one of the core principals we adopted as we developed the model was that it had to include an element of downside financial risk and be considered an advanced apm if implemented. however, we also understood that some emergency physicians might not have experience taking on risk, and therefore we provided an option that allowed participants to transition over a period of time into downside risk. the proposed changes to the shared savings program take on the same overall approach to transitioning participants to downside risk that the aucm does. if cms were to finalize this proposal, there is one adjustment that we urge cms to make in the final rule. in the first two levels of the basic track, which is shared savings only, cms is proposing that acos only be eligible for 25 percent of the savings. under the proposal, this percentage increases to 30 percent at the third level, 40 percent at the fourth level, and 50 percent at the fifth and final level of the track. we believe that cms should increase the maximum shared savings percentage in the first two levels to at least 40 to 50 percent and make corresponding increases in the third and fourth levels as well. although acos in the first two levels are not subject to any downside risk, they still must make significant investments in information technology and care coordination processes to be successful in the program and get ready to take on downside risk. a maximum shared savings percentage of 25 percent may be too low for some acos to cover their initial investment and therefore may be a barrier for these acos to participate. use of waivers in the proposed rule, cms is expanding the use and availability of the telehealth and skilled nursing facility (snf) three-day waivers. telehealth waiver to comply with the balanced budget act (bba) of 2018, cms is proposing to waive the telehealth originating site requirement for acos that take on downside risk and choose prospective assignment. cms is also seeking comment on applying this waiver to acos that have downside risk but choose preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation. acep believes that telehealth services have clear benefits to patients and provide an opportunity for savings by payers such as cms. therefore, we thoroughly support cms providing this additional flexibility in the coverage of telehealth services. however, beyond the scope of the aco waiver, we believe that telehealth can also be an effective tool for emergency physicians to use to serve their patients. we have included a telehealth waiver in the aucm that allows emergency physicians to provide telehealth services into the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home or residence. there are also established examples of high quality, cost-effective telehealth programs in the emergency department (ed) setting that allow greater access to an emergency physician in the inner city or rural emergency departments that would not normally be able to economically support that level of provider. additionally, telehealth access from the ed setting to other medical specialists such as neurologists or psychiatrists can help provide faster access to specialty care and reduce delays in critically needed treatment and time patients spend boarded in the\ned. as more and more small and rural hospitals close, eds consequently close too, leaving a gap in unscheduled \n request for comment on quality measures\n cms is seeking comments on new quality measures to add to the shared savings program, including those related to opioid utilization. acep believes that one of the contributing factors leading to the paucity of emergency physicians actively participating in the shared savings program is that there are not many measures in the program that are relevant to providers practicing in the ed setting. therefore, we welcome the opportunity to recommend some measures that are meaningful to emergency medicine.\n found below is a list of emergency medicine-related quality payment program (qpp) measures that could be applicable to the shared savings program. these measures, which are used by acep\u00e2\u0080\u0099s qualified clinical data registry (qcdr), the clinical emergency data registry (cedr), focus on the appropriate use of certain treatments. they correlate to some of the current overuse shared savings program measures including aco-44 (use of imaging studies for low back pain) and aco-28 (hypertension (htn): controlling high blood pressure).\n\n\n", "0368": "see attached file(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n october 16, 2018\n\n the honorable seema verma administrator centers for medicare and medicaid services\nu.s. department of health and human services \n 200 independence avenue sw washington, dc 20201 attn: cms-1701-p\n re: medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success\n dear administrator verma:\n aarp is pleased to provide comments on the proposed rule concerning the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and its regulations for accountable care organizations (acos). aarp, with its nearly 38 million members in all 50 states, the district of columbia, and the u.s. territories, is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization that helps empower people to choose how they live as they age, strengthens communities, and fights for the issues that matter most to families, such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse. aarp strongly believes that innovative delivery system reforms are critical to ensure medicare continues to meet beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 health care needs and the program remains sustainable now and in the future. the mssp has the potential to make significant progress toward these ends in the traditional medicare program.\n 2\n\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements\n snf 3-day rule waiver\n presently, medicare requires an individual to have a prior inpatient admission of at least three days before it will cover the subsequent stay in a skilled nursing facility (snf). cms allows acos to apply for a waiver of this rule, if they meet certain conditions. specifically, that they bear two-sided risk, use prospective beneficiary attribution, and that the snf maintains at least a 3-star quality rating. cms is proposing to expand waiver eligibility to acos using preliminary prospective attribution with retrospective reconciliation. it is also proposing to allow application of the waiver to snf services furnished under swing bed arrangements.\n aarp supports this greater eligibility for the 3-day stay rule waiver, and believes more should be done \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as counting time in \u00e2\u0080\u009cobservation\u00e2\u0080\u009d toward the 3-day requirement. medicare beneficiaries should be able to receive the most appropriate care in the most appropriate setting, and at the most appropriate time. the proposed rule change will expand access to snf care, and reduce reliance on higher-cost hospital settings. we are mindful, though, that many hospitals and critical access hospitals with swing beds are not part of the quality rating system. we urge cms to continuously monitor swing- bed operators who have agreements with acos, to ensure that they maintain a high- quality level of care.\n billing and payment for telehealth services\n aarp strongly supports allowing greater use of telehealth by accountable care organizations. removing the originating site restrictions will increase access to health services and allow for more convenient care delivery for medicare beneficiaries. telehealth could improve treatment adherence, as well as reduce unnecessary travel to appointments. we urge cms, though, to waive cost-sharing obligations for beneficiaries wherever possible. assessing a copay for a service without an actual encounter, or for brief interactions or monitoring, is burdensome and confusing for people with medicare.\n beneficiary incentives\n cms proposes to implement provisions of the bipartisan budget act (bba) of 2018 by allowing two-sided risk acos to offer limited financial incentives to eligible beneficiaries who are prospectively or voluntarily assigned to the aco when they receive qualified primary care services for which a co-insurance payment is required. cms proposes to limit the incentive payment to an amount of up to $20 updated annually by the cpi-u. acos would be required to account for and report the number and total value of incentive payments and cms would be required to report to congress on the impact of the beneficiary incentive program.\n 3\n aarp supports the use of limited, evidence-based financial incentives with appropriate safe guards to encourage healthy behaviors, improve adherence to prescribed regimens, or follow a professionally developed care plan for management of chronic conditions. however, we are concerned that the proposed financial incentives do not appear to be evidence-based nor do they appear to be well targeted to encourage healthy behaviors or follow a care plan for chronic care management. we are also concerned that acos could use financial incentives to steer beneficiaries to aco network providers and discourage beneficiaries from seeking appropriate care outside of the aco network.\n aarp agrees that acos should be required to notify beneficiaries in writing of the availability of financial incentives using a cms approved template. however, acos should be strictly prohibited from advertising beneficiary incentive programs, as these incentives should be for encouraging good health in individuals, rather than marketing an aco.\n aarp strongly urges that acos be required to publicly report information about a beneficiary incentive program, rather than simply reporting this information to cms. aarp also strongly urges that acos not be permitted to accept funding for beneficiary incentives from outside entities, such as insurers or drug manufacturers, as this could encourage inappropriate kick-backs.\n empowering beneficiary choice\n beneficiary notifications\n the proposed rule requires acos to include additional content in the beneficiary information notice (bin) to emphasize beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to select a primary care physician and thereby trigger voluntary alignment to an aco. the rule also proposes requiring that acos give all fee-for-service (ffs) beneficiaries a bin at their first primary care visit of each performance year, in addition to the current beneficiary notification requirements.\n we commend cms for continuing to recognize the value of informing beneficiaries about their provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation in an aco, what such participation means for patient care, and beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights. aarp strongly favors prospective notice to beneficiaries, which includes clear and pertinent information that: (1) permits aco providers to engage patients in conversations describing patient rights; (2) gives the beneficiary critical information about possible consequences of receiving care in an aco and that participating providers may have unique incentives that could affect service delivery under the aco arrangement; and (3) allows beneficiaries to evaluate their options to determine the best aco for their circumstances.\n 4\n we applaud cms for recognizing that many beneficiaries and their family caregivers may not initiate a request for a bin and we support the requirement that beneficiaries be given the notice at the beginning of each performance year in addition to having the ability to request it. however, we think that it is highly desirable for beneficiaries to receive information indicating their provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation in an aco, and their rights and responsibilities in this context, well in advance of an office visit. many beneficiaries and family caregivers who receive the bin at their point of care will have little time to digest it and have little practical recourse. aarp urges cms to require aco participants to notify their patients of a provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement in an aco as soon as possible before their first visit of each performance year to an aco provider. this will give patients enough time to decide if they want to continue to receive care from aco participants or if they wish to align themselves with the aco. medicare beneficiaries who cannot receive a bin before their office visit (e.g. because they have never received services from the aco) should be given the notice during their first encounter with any aco provider\u00e2\u0080\u0094not just with primary care providers. this would be especially important during the proposed first performance period of six months because many beneficiaries who receive services from an aco may not receive primary care services during that relatively short time interval.\n aarp believes that the proposed standardized notice should be written in \u00e2\u0080\u009cplain english\u00e2\u0080\u009d and address low health literacy levels. there should also be versions which are culturally and linguistically appropriate. given the linguistic diversity among medicare beneficiaries, aarp urges cms to consider broadening the number of languages in which the bin template is available beyond english and spanish.\n cms solicits comments on whether the template notice should include other information outlining aco activities that may be related to or affect a medicare ffs beneficiary. aarp believes that beneficiaries should be notified as soon as possible if certain providers are no longer affiliated with the aco. such information is critical for beneficiaries, especially as they make decisions on whether to align themselves with an aco or possibly opt into an aco.\n aarp supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to maintain current requirements that an aco participant notify beneficiaries in writing of its participation in an aco by posting signs in its facilities and, in settings in which beneficiaries receive primary care services, by making a standardized written notice available upon request. however, we urge cms to standardize the information available to beneficiaries through the poster and in the bin, by including information on how beneficiaries can select a primary care physician and become aligned with an aco in the template language. we also encourage cms to require acos to provide the bin in paper or in electronic format (e-mail) to beneficiaries who request it, according to beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 preference.\n 5\n medicare & you handbook, the 1\u00e2\u0080\u0093800\u00e2\u0080\u0093medicare number, and other beneficiary resources.\n opt-in assignment methodology\n aarp agrees with cms that beneficiaries who wish to do so should be able to directly choose their aco in addition to the ability to indirectly opt into an aco by choosing to be cared for by a primary care clinician. we also support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 view that any change in the current assignment methodology to include opt-in assignments should be incremental and should first be pilot-tested, for example, by offering it as an option that acos can elect every performance year. we share cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perspective that under opt-in assignment, beneficiaries could continue to select from any opt-in aco, without geographic restrictions. aarp does not support any modifications to the aco assignment methodology that would lead to restricting ffs medicare beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 access to providers to certain geographic areas. we strongly urge cms to monitor and to evaluate the implications of introducing any version of an opt-in assignment methodology on: aco availability; beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 access to acos; acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to manage patient care; and the quality of care in acos.\n the proposed rule discusses an opt-in process similar to the process by which beneficiaries currently select medicare advantage (ma) plans. since research has shown many beneficiaries report confusion around selecting ma plans, if such an approach is used, beneficiaries will need to have adequate information to make informed decisions. aarp is concerned that introducing an opt-in assignment option would carry a high risk of beneficiary confusion, particularly about the difference between the voluntary alignment process and a potentially new opt-in process. if cms decides to move ahead with an opt-in assignment option, we strongly urge you to require acos provide beneficiaries with timely, easily accessible and clear information about which providers are part of the aco, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality ratings, the

cms-1701-p; medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success proposed rule\n dear administrator verma:\n amda \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the society for post-acute and long-term care medicine appreciates the opportunity to provide input to the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) on the proposed rule for medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success proposed rule.\n the society is the only medical specialty society representing the community of over 50,000 medical directors, physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other practitioners working in the various post-acute and long-term care (pa/ltc) settings. the society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 6,000 members work in skilled nursing facilities, long-term care and assisted living communities, continuing care retirement communities (ccrc), home care, hospice, pace programs, and other settings. in serving this population, these clinicians care for the most high-risk and costly group of beneficiaries covered by medicare and medicaid programs.\n our comments will focus on the following areas of the proposed rule:\n page 2 of 5\n revisions to the definition of primary care services used in beneficiary assignment:\n cms proposes to change the methodology for exclusion of snf visits from primary care definition for the purposes of beneficiary attribution. specifically, on page 418899 of federal register, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas previously discussed in section ii.e.3.a, acos and other stakeholders have expressed concerns regarding our current policy of identifying services billed under cpt codes 99304 through 99318 furnished in a snf by using the pos modifier 31. we continue to believe it is appropriate to exclude from assignment services billed under cpt codes 99304 through 99318 when such services are furnished in a snf. however, we agree with stakeholders that it might increase the accuracy of beneficiary assignment for these vulnerable and generally high cost beneficiaries if we were to revise our method for determining whether services identified by cpt codes 99304 through 99318 were furnished in a snf to focus on whether the beneficiary also received snf facility services on the same day. we believe it would be feasible for us to directly and more precisely determine whether services identified by cpt codes 99304 through 99318 were furnished in a snf by analyzing our facility claims data files rather than by using the pos modifier 31 in our professional claims data files. operationally, we would exclude professional services claims billed under cpt codes 99304 through 99318 from use in the assignment methodology when there is a snf facility claim in our claims files with dates of service that overlap with the date of service for the professional service. therefore, we propose to revise the regulation at \u00e2\u00a7 425.400(c)(1)(iv)(a)(2), effective for performance years starting on january 1, 2019 and subsequent performance years, to remove the exclusion of claims including the pos code 31 and in its place indicate more generally that we would exclude services billed under cpt codes 99304 through 99318 when such services are furnished in a\nsnf.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \n\n comments: the society strongly supports this proposal. pos coding is not always accurate and this proposal will provide a more accurate account of snf services.\n\n expand use of telehealth for practitioners in acos in performance-based risk arrangements:\n to support acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 coordination of care across settings, cms proposes regulations to govern the use of telehealth services by certain acos under performance-based risk, consistent with the requirements of the bba of 2018. under this approach, beginning in january 1, 2020, eligible physicians and practitioners in applicable acos in performance-based risk tracks could receive payment for telehealth services furnished to prospectively assigned beneficiaries even if the otherwise applicable geographic limitations are not met, including when the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home is the originating site.\n comments: the society supports the expanded use of telehealth for practitioners in acos. we urge cms to consider expanding the use of telehealth in the snf and rescind the limitation of one telehealth subsequent nursing facility care visit every 30 days reported by cpt codes 99307 through 99310. we are concerned that the limited allowed use, once per 30-days, in the skilled nursing facility setting is a barrier to better access to care.\n page 3 of 5\n rules have shown positive results and we believe should be adopted in the medicare aco program. rather than using an arbitrary limitation on visits, cms should allow for the use of these services when they are medically necessary, as is the case for face-to-face visits in the nursing home setting.\n we further recommend that cms direct its contractors to monitor the utilization of these telehealth services to ensure they are not overutilized.  if widespread evidence of overutilization becomes apparent, then cms should consider applying limits that ensure appropriate care is being delivered and take appropriate action against those who submit these codes excessively and without medical necessity.  but there is no reason to expect that these services would be overutilized and create an atmosphere of scrutiny that will discourage the utilization of this valuable technology that can help prevent hospitalization and rehospitalization by providing a more expedient practitioner evaluation and workup.\n however, until evidence of overutilization is obtained, we believe an arbitrary and very low limit could hinder access to appropriate care under the telehealth benefit, especially in underserved areas.  for a busy pa/ltc practitioner, if a single patient in a single nursing home 40 minutes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 driving distance away has a change of condition, it may be unrealistic to make the trip and lose several hours of otherwise potentially productive clinical time to see a single patient.  further, many transfers occur at night and on weekends when clinicians may be unavailable or may not have the necessary time or capacity to evaluate a patient enough to determine whether they should be sent to the hospital. in such instances, a telehealth visit may well obviate the need for an emergency room visit.  allowing for such visits anytime there is a significant change, makes intuitive sense, and may allow for more timely practitioner assessments of patients who need them.\n while previous reasoning that because of the potential acuity and complexity of snf inpatients, a restriction on the frequency of such visits may have made sense a decade ago, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simply not realistic in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s era of value-based medicine, which cms has embraced. we remain committed to ensuring that these patients continue to receive in-person, hands-on visits as appropriate to manage their care and we continue to agree that patients in snfs/nfs are complex and need to be seen by trained and qualified clinicians, but we believe previous concerns about overutilization of telehealth are simply outdated. current research shows that telehealth allows patients to be monitored more closely and allows the clinician to evaluate and understand when a patient should be seen due to a change of condition. without telehealth, these patients may not be seen at all, and end up in the emergency room as a result.\n value-based models on quality reporting and outcomes and are testing new ways of delivering telehealth in a way that is more efficient and benefits patients. as the systems move from a siloed approach to a more integrated and aligned health system, it makes no sense to issue arbitrary limitations on one sector of healthcare that do not apply to all others.\n we strongly urge cms to allow for more frequent reassessment of patients with a change of condition that is highly likely to result in a trip to the emergency department or a hospitalization. one visit a month is woefully inadequate even for a clinician to provide telehealth evaluation and then reassess whether the ordered intervention has been successful. this system requires flexibility to allow practices to test innovative methods to deliver patient care that achieves the stated desired outcomes.\n\n\n\n page 4 of 5\n expand skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver eligibility:\n cms proposes to allow eligible acos in performance-based risk within the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path and the enhanced track use of the existing snf 3-day rule waiver, regardless of their choice of prospective assignment or preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation, to support aco efforts to increase quality and decrease costs. cms also proposes amending the existing snf 3-day rule waiver to allow critical access hospitals and other small, rural hospitals operating under a swing bed agreement to be eligible to partner with eligible acos as snf affiliates for purposes of the snf 3-day rule waiver.\n comments: the society supports expanding the skilled nursing facility 3-day rule wavier eligibility to include more beneficiaries. we urge cms to promote expansion of the snf 3-day hospitalization requirement to include both snf (pos 31) and nf (pos 32).  the current 3-day waiver excludes beneficiaries residing in these sites.  currently, the waiver is available to advanced apms under macra that take downside risk that builds in safeguards against potential abuse. other \u00e2\u0080\u009cbundled\u00e2\u0080\u009d payment arrangement such as medicare advantage plans, including institutional special needs plans have had the 3- day wavier for both snf and nf for many years and it has served powerful tool to improve cost.\n\n snf minimum star requirement\n we urge cms to remove the requirement that snf affiliates must have and maintain an overall rating of at least three stars in the quality rating system to partner with acos for purposes of the snf three-day waiver. the society officially adopted a policy asking for this removal, and the american medical association also adopted this as policy. we believe that the medicare snf five-star quality rating system has some fundamental weaknesses, relies primarily on self-reported data by nursing homes, and can be quite variable for a variety of reasons.\n because a facility can go from a four-star to a two-star facility based on a single unfortunate (even completely unpredictable) event with a high-level deficiency, or based on a single \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad\u00e2\u0080\u009d annual survey\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and because it may take the facility two years to regain their four-star rating, even if they are continuing to provide very good care\u00e2\u0080\u0094we feel it is capricious and overly restrictive to have a flat, unconditional three- star minimum requirement.\n page 5 of 5\n\n\n conclusion\n we deeply appreciate your consideration of our recommendations, and your continued endeavors to improve the quality of medical care medicare beneficiaries receive as well as to reduce the burdens on clinicians.  we are committed to working collaboratively and constructively with cms and others as final regulations are prepared and the agency works to implement these welcome and much-needed reforms.\n\n sincerely,\n\n\n cari levy, md, phd, cmd president\n\n\n", "0370": "thank you for your consideration of the attached comments from

savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success proposed rule\n dear administrator verma:\n the medical group management association (mgma) is pleased to offer the following comments to the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) regarding the medicare shared savings program (mssp) pathways to success proposed rule. mgma is the premier association for professionals who lead medical practice. since 1926, through data, people, insights, and advocacy, mgma empowers medical group practices to innovate and create meaningful change in healthcare. with a membership of more than 40,000 medical practice administrators, executives, and leaders, mgma represents more than 12,500 organizations of all sizes, types, structures and specialties that deliver almost half of the healthcare in the united states. mgma appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts in the proposed rule to increase stability, predictability, and regulatory burden relief for accountable care organizations (acos) participating in the mssp. however, we have significant concerns regarding some of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposals and recommend the agency revisit proposed policies that would compromise sustained and robust participation in the mssp. we urge cms to: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increase stability and predictability in the program by finalizing the proposal to lengthen agreement periods to five years. constant change in payment policies across medicare programs is disruptive and burdensome; cms should capitalize on efforts to introduce program stability where it\ncan. \n 1717 pennsylvania ave. nw, #600 washington, dc 20006 t 202.293.3450 f 202.293.2787 mgma.org administrator verma\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 2\n\n 1717 pennsylvania ave. nw, #600

what drives changes in provider behavior. these changes can take years to produce results, as demonstrated by the increasingly positive results for acos that are in the program for a longer period of time. as policy experts in health affairs suggest, there is a \u00e2\u0080\u009clearning curve\u00e2\u0080\u009d that extends more than two years and that acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cshared savings rate doubled with three years of experience, from about 21% for those acos in their first mssp performance year to over 41-43% for those acos in their fourth and fifth performance years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d1 research to date suggests that acos improve with experience in the program, supporting the position that acos should be permitted additional time to become comfortable in the program without being forced into a risk-based model. permit acos that meet performance goals to remain in shared savings-only mgma recommends that, instead of requiring acos to move to a risk-based model following their initial years in shared savings-only (two years as proposed in basic tracks a and b or longer as recommended), acos that are still unprepared to assume risk that have met certain performance-based criteria should be permitted to remain in a track 1 equivalent model for as long as the aco continues to meet specified cost and quality criteria. mgma recommends that, as long as an aco is not continually losing money for the program and is maintaining high quality scores, it is in the interest of medicare to keep the organization in the program even if it does not proceed to a risk-bearing model. as long as savings and quality standards are met, acos in track 1 or an equivalent shared savings-only model should be eligible for continued participation in the mssp at the current sharing rate of 50 percent. acos that are not successful could be dropped from the program or pushed into a risk-bearing model, such as the proposed glide path to risk, where they would be required to pay back continued losses. since the inception of the mssp, cms has emphasized the need for acos to assume downside risk as the best way to reduce unnecessary expenditures. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 policy basis is that acos with downside risk achieve greater savings than shared savings only models. however, recent results discredit this assumption: in 2017, the 433 one-sided mssp track 1 acos saved an estimated $291 million, compared to $23 million in savings generated by track 2 and 3 acos. research also shows that acos demonstrate an increasing likelihood of achieving shared savings over time, which demonstrates the value of these models and the need to allow acos sufficient time to demonstrate positive results. for example, august 2017 findings from the department of health and human services inspector general and 2017 mssp performance results available in the public use file serve as evidence that acos need experience in the program to generate positive results and demonstrate change. mgma has concerns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 emphasis on the move to risk and assertion that high levels of risk are the key driver of cost savings and achieving program goals. given this backdrop, requiring acos to accept downside risk is not the only approach that cms could use to increase net savings to the medicare program from the mssp. we recommend that cms consider alternative approaches to accomplishing program goals aside from the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emphasis on requiring all acos to eventually move to high levels of risk as the only answer. for example, one policy expert identified several alternative ideas for increasing mssp savings, including:\n1. dropping acos from the program if they have not achieved savings after several years;  \n\n2. reducing shared savings payments to acos that incur large losses before generating savings; and \n\n 1717 pennsylvania ave. nw, #600 washington, dc 20006 t 202.293.3450 f 202.293.2787 mgma.org administrator verma\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 4\n\n\n3. allowing acos to take accountability for the specific types of spending they are capable of \n controlling, rather than total medicare spending.2 we recommend that cms analyze these ideas and other approaches and consider the advantages and disadvantages of alternatives to mandating a transition to risk-based models. glide path to risk for acos prepared to take on risk, mgma would support a voluntary glidepath to higher risk levels. however, mgma opposes forcing high-revenue acos to assume greater risk at an accelerated timeline and opposes requiring any aco to move into the enhanced track. instead, we urge cms to offer the enhanced track as a voluntary option for acos prepared for higher levels of risk and reward. acos prepared to assume risk should be able to remain in the equivalent of track 1+ (proposed basic level\ne). as recommended by mgma and other stakeholder groups, cms developed track 1+ as a new \n participation option that incorporates less downside risk than what is required in existing two-sided aco models. we greatly appreciate that this participation option qualifies as an advanced alternative payment model, as well as cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 plans to incorporate track 1+ policies into level e of the basic track. we believe, however, that acos should be permitted to remain in track 1+ or its equivalent indefinitely, without being forced to progress to the enhanced track. mgma members have expressed significant interest in the track 1+ model, and those already participating in it have reported positive feedback about experience. shared savings rate under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal, acos would have two years in an upside only model, with a shared savings rate that is reduced from the current 50 percent to 25 percent under the proposed basic track levels a and b. mgma urges cms to maintain a shared savings rate of at least 50 percent to ensure a viable business model. as mgma and others have repeatedly indicated, participating in an aco requires significant upfront investment and continuing financial expenditures for care management and operational changes. according to a report by the national association of acos (naacos), acos spend nearly $2 million a year on average for mssp participation, including investments made in health information technology, population health management, and administration. slashing shared savings payments in half would not allow acos to recoup those investments and would deter future participation in the mssp. risk adjustment methodology cms proposes modifications to its risk adjustment policies, including changes that would allow aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk scores to change over time. mgma supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to account for patient characteristics and changes in patient health status by allowing risk scores to change over time. the risk adjustment methodology used to in the mssp to date has failed to account for patient characteristics and changes in those characteristics that can result in the need for more care or more expensive care, which unfairly penalizes acos that have sicker patients. physician group practices that treat disadvantaged and vulnerable patient populations can be unfairly penalized by programs that do not have adequate adjustments for clinical complexity and socioeconomic factors. although the current proposal would allow acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk scores to change over time, the risk adjustment methodology still does not account for important factors in patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 health care needs, such as functional status and severity or stage of illness. we are also concerned that the proposed +/- 3 percent over the course of an agreement period is insufficient to account for changes year over year. without proper risk adjustment, cost and quality metrics could be tainted by any number of confounding variables, which could lead to unfairly penalizing clinicians for treating high-risk patient populations. accurate risk adjustment is necessary to\n 1717 pennsylvania ave. nw, #600 washington, dc 20006 t 202.293.3450 f 202.293.2787 mgma.org administrator verma\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 5\n\n minimizes differences in health and other risk factors that impact performance but may be outside the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control. benchmarking methodology cms indicates it is continuing to refine its aco benchmarking methodology and proposes a number of changes, including proposals that relate to incorporating a regional expenditure component into the rebased benchmark. in 2016, cms sought to create long-term sustainability in the mssp by introducing a regional benchmarking methodology for acos that enter a second or third contract. mgma supports incorporating a component of regional expenditure data into aco benchmarks during the initial agreement period, as currently proposed, rather than waiting until at least the second agreement period. however, while we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attempt to find an appropriate balance between a national and regional trend rate, there is need for continued improvement in this area. in particular, as mgma and other have repeatedly pointed out, we take issue with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 policy to include an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own attributed population in the regional benchmark. this has the effect of measuring an aco against itself, thus making it harder for acos to realize savings and be comfortable enough to assume downside risk. rather than comparing acos to themselves and other acos, cms should compare aco performance relative to the fee-for-service medicare population, by defining the regional population as assignable beneficiaries without aco-assigned beneficiaries for acos in the region. at the very least, cms should exclude the aco itself from the region to prevent a comparison that essentially double counts those aco-assigned beneficiaries. quality measures cms proposes to discontinue use of the quality measure 11 that assesses an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level of adoption of cehrt. instead, cms proposes that, acos in a track or a payment model within a track that does not meet the financial risk standard to be an advanced apm, would attest to meeting required cehrt levels. mgma strongly supports the proposal to remove aco measure 11 and instead rely on attestation to evaluate the use of cehrt. in announcing new initiatives related to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeaningful measures\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cpatients over paperwork,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms acknowledged the challenges associated with administrative tasks and committed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cremoving regulatory obstacles that get in the way of providers pending time with patients.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms should utilize this same approach\u00e2\u0080\u0093mitigating the misdirection of resources and promoting value over volume\u00e2\u0080\u0093in its strategies for future payment reform. conclusion we appreciate the opportunity to share our comments regarding the

the notification requirements  of  the  final  rule  and  next  generation  aco  model  participation agreement. together, mrs. short and i have lived in the medicare aco trenches since the program began, and hold first-hand experience of how the final rule impacts aco operations, compliance, and engagement.\n it  is  through  this  lens of this experience that  we  reviewed  the  nprm and  developed  our recommendations.    our  main  goals  for  the  shared  savings  program  include the  reduction  of unnecessary administrative  obstacles  and  confusion in  regard  to  regulatory  requirements, increased  tools  and  opportunities  for  beneficiary  and  provider  engagement,  and  improved resources  for  acos.    we  truly  believe  that  in  order  for  the  shared  savings  program  to have continued success, acos need guidance as well as expanded opportunities for innovation.\n recommendations:\n alternative assignment methodology\n\n\n raising our legacy. wilemsresourcegroup.com \u00e2\u0080\u009cenrollment\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the aco.  moreover, the process is likely to increase administrative burdens for acos, particularly those which are made up of independent physicians. if the proposal is finalized, cms  should  ensure  that  acos  who  do  not  have  the  resources  available  to  actively  pursue beneficiary  \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d  are  not  inadvertently  punished  by  additional  changes  to  the  claims-based assignment methodology.\n identification of prior participation\n cms should consider providing more than one method for identifying limits for prior participation, rather than basing this on a certain percentage of aco participants.  while a straight percentage of tins is more straightforward, it can be unnecessarily limiting to acos comprised of large, single tin entities.  cms should consider allowing acos to use a calculation based on tins or npis as appropriate for their composition.\n initial beneficiary notification\n cms should not reinstate the requirement that beneficiaries receive this notification at the first primary care visit.  this proactive notification requirement was in place at the beginning of the shared  savings  program  and  created  a  large administrative  burden  for  participant  practices without much benefit to the beneficiary. the administration of this requirement is a huge burden in itself, the oversight of compliance with the requirement is another level of concern.  if cms believes that a more proactive notification would increase beneficiary engagement, they should consider using the aco spotlight to recommend that acos provide talking points to providers, rather than requiring a beneficiary notification process.  cms has used these recommendations to promote program success in the past with such things as recommending acos focus on annual wellness visit completions.  it is an effective technique that would serve to increase beneficiary engagement more  effectively  while  minimizing  the  administrative  burden  on  acos. even  the determination of which beneficiaries should receive the notification is problematic.  while an aco could notify all medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, if the beneficiary is not aligned to the aco then  the  content  of  the  notification  would  not  apply  to  the  beneficiary  and  is  likely  to  cause confusion  as  to  the  availability  aco  programs  and  benefit  enhancements.  if  an  aco  is  only required  to  notify  beneficiaries  aligned  to  the  aco,  then  the  notification  process  becomes  a constantly moving target as alignment rosters shift throughout the year.\n at a minimum, cms should allow the aco to disseminate the notification in other ways, such as through email or through an initial mailing.  cms should also allow the notification process to occur once per year, at the beginning of the program year, and not based on when a beneficiary visits the office. while these processes are still costly and administratively burdensome, they may be more attractive to some acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially those with large attribution.\n\n\n raising our legacy. wilemsresourcegroup.com practices will provide an opportunity to engage the beneficiary in a more meaningful way from the outset of the program.\n beneficiary incentive program notification requirements\n cms  should  not  require  acos  to  notify  cms  of  any  modification  to  its beneficiary incentive program prior to implementing such modification.  this requirement is much too broad and would cause unnecessary delays in the implementation of operational policies and processes. as acos work to implement these programs there will, and should, be constant shifts and adjustments in how the incentive is administered.  these small shifts would likely be invisible to the beneficiary, but if the aco were required to report every shift to cms for approval prior to implementation, the delay in implementation would inevitably lead to a delay in distribution of the payment.  acos should be allowed to administer the incentive within the guidelines established by cms and be prepared to submit proof of this compliance upon request by cms.\n beneficiary incentive payment distribution\n cms  should not  require  that  the  aco  legal  entity  furnish  the  incentive  payments  directly  to beneficiaries.  acos should be allowed to determine the best method for distribution within their organization, as long as they ensure appropriate oversight of the payments as part of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s methodology for identifying and correcting potential compliance concerns.  this oversight can be monitored by cms upon request.\n beneficiary incentive program marketing & outreach\n the beneficiary incentive program is a useful tool for ensuring care coordination, but can also be an effective method for increasing beneficiary engagement.  acos should be allowed to develop marketing and outreach materials to explain the program and the terms under which a beneficiary could  receive  an  incentive  payment.   cms  could  ensure  acos  did  not  make  inappropriate statements in outreach materials through the marketing material review process.\n marketing material submission and review\n\n\n raising our legacy. wilemsresourcegroup.com increase  beneficiary  engagement,  while continuing  to limit  risk  of  misleading or  inaccurate information to beneficiaries and providers.\n at a minimum, cms should remove the requirement to file provider facing materials.  this change was already made as part of the next generation aco model and allows for much more effective provider engagement programs.  it also removes much of the concern and confusion around which materials are required to be filed and which ones are not.  the current definition of a marketing material and activity under the final rule is extremely vague, especially as it relates to provider facing pieces.  acos who have experience in the program understand that cms does not expect (or want) an aco to file their compliance training for approval as a marketing material.  but this does technically fall within the black letter of the current definition.  aco compliance officers are constantly reviewing provider facing materials simply to determine whether it meets the intent of this definition, rather than whether it meets the written definition.  if cms cannot remove the requirement to file provider facing materials, then the regulations should be updated to clarify the definition of marketing materials as it relates to provider facing pieces.  this would be in line with the  exceptions  which have  always  been in  place  for  beneficiary  facing  materials  under  the program.\n extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy\n cms should consider the revising the policy to account for the impact on financials, quality, and the opportunity to identify natural disaster related impact at  the beneficiary and  claims level. using  the  claims  data  and  analysis  of  florida  acos  performance  results  after  the  impact  of hurricane irma, acos realized that there are things that could not have been forecasted.\n cms should update the policy to not only mitigate shared losses but provide parity for the msr and mlr for acos who just missed their msr or exceeded their mlr as a result of the natural disaster and associated part a cost.  we support parity mitigating the impacts of natural disaster as they pertain to benchmarking/msr/mlr excluding them from pys as well as bys including: use of blended national/regional trend under normal circumstances and 100% regional trend during extreme and uncontrollable circumstances; removal of claims with natural disaster modifies from py and by calculations as further defined later in the use of natural disaster codes section; and removal of beneficiaries expenditures for beneficiaries who resided in a disaster area during a disaster period.\n cms should modify quality performance scores for all acos in the affected area. cms could use the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historic performance instead of  the mean quality score when an aco is in its third performance  year;  remove  impacted  beneficiaries  through  a  claims  identifier;  or  remove beneficiaries from the area and during the period identified as being impacted from the natural disaster from the numerator/denominator or form the quality measures claims sample.\n\n\n raising our legacy. wilemsresourcegroup.com ensure they include the natural disaster modifier as appropriate. acos would have accountability and  cms  would  have  the  tools  to  identify  and  remove  claims  during  the  final  reconciliation addressing cost and utilization as well as from readmission-related quality measures.   this will ensure  that  it  mitigates  the  unintended extreme  part  a  impact  from  natural  disasters  where patients could not be safely discharged to a skilled nursing facility or home due to lack of electricity, flood  or  unsafe  conditions  that  cause  spikes  in  admissions,  increased  length  of  stay  and readmissions are omitted.\n\n conclusion: overall,  we  strongly  endorse  and  support  the  efforts  by  cms  to  emphasize  patients  over paperwork and  reduce  administrative  burden  while  protecting  the  integrity  of  the  medicare shared  savings  program. however,  we  believe  that  the  real-world  implementation  of  these proposed  changes  will  cause  more  burden  to  acos  than  benefit  to  patients  and  cms  should consider our recommendations to correct this imbalance.\n sincerely,\n\n", "0373": "see attached

medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success\n dear administrator verma,\n on behalf of the clinicians, administrators, and team members of novant health medical group (nhmg), thank you for the opportunity to provide comments in response to provisions contained within the medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success proposed rule (the \u00e2\u0080\u009c2018 mssp/aco proposed rule\u00e2\u0080\u009d).1\n part of novant health, an integrated network of physician clinics, outpatient facilities and hospitals dedicated to delivering a seamless and convenient healthcare experience to communities in virginia, north and south carolina, and georgia, nhmg is a physician-led multispecialty organization comprised of more than 2,500 physician partners and other highly-skilled professionals providing care in over 550 clinic locations. nhmg clinicians participate in the mssp through two acos: 1) novant health accountable care organization i, llc, which in 2017 provided care to more than 78,000 medicare beneficiaries primarily in north and south carolina; and 2) novant health uva health system accountable care organization, llc, which in 2017 provided care to approximately 6,500 medicare beneficiaries primarily in northern virginia.\n we are committed to the transition from fee-for-service (ffs) to value-based care, and believe acos are some of the most important vehicles to ensure the success and sustainability of this transition. through\n 2 investments in the infrastructure necessary to effectively manage population health and the implementation of innovative clinical and operational approaches to improving quality while reducing costs, nhmg clinicians participating in acos are transforming care in our clinics and wellness in our communities. in our first year of participation, novant health acos generated more than $12.6 million in savings and outpaced the national average for all acos in reducing hospital discharges, readmissions, emergency department (ed) visits, and skilled nursing facility (snf) utilization.\n nhmg clinicians and our independent partners look forward to continuing and building upon these early successes as we progress through our first agreement period and look to subsequent agreement periods. we encourage cms to pursue policies which will encourage participation in acos by as many clinicians and organizations as possible across the nation. while cms has proposed multiple changes which will improve the program, we believe that clinicians need to continue to have both time and flexibility in implementing the clinical, cultural, and structural changes necessary to achieve success and move into more advanced downside risk models.\n below, please find our comments in response to specific provisions contained in the 2018 mssp/aco proposed rule.\n limiting the amount of time acos can remain in shared savings-only arrangements in the mssp from two 3-year agreement periods under track 1 to a maximum of just two years under the newly proposed basic track; gradually introducing downside risk for acos under the basic track. nhmg encourages cms to consider extending the amount of time acos can remain in shared savings-only arrangements. while the benefits of aco participation are numerous for both patients and clinicians, these benefits take significant time and investment to fully realize. patient engagement, transformation of clinical workflows, optimization of electronic health record (ehr) technology utilization, and transitioning to team-based innovative care can and often do require longer than two years.\n however, nhmg supports the proposal by cms to pursue a tiered approach to introducing downside financial risk for acos and their participating clinicians in the basic track. we believe this approach will strike an appropriate balance between encouraging the transition to downside financial risk while not creating an undue burden on clinicians and acos as they make this transition. as a voluntary program, cms must maintain appropriate incentives for participation in order to ensure the healthcare system does not slow its conversion to a system which prioritizes value over volume. nhmg believes that continuing to allow acos more time to prepare for downside financial risk and taking a stepwise approach to implementing downside risk models would achieve this goal.\n reducing the maximum potential shared savings under shared savings-only arrangements under basic track levels a and b to 25 percent. nhmg urges cms to maintain the maximum potential shared savings under basic track levels a and b at the current mssp track 1 level of 50 percent. current aco participants in mssp track 1 (who comprise the vast majority of current acos participating in the mssp) entering into the basic track and committing to a transition to downside financial risk would benefit from stability in the potential for shared savings.\n\n 3 eliminating the distinction between continuously and newly assigned patients for the purposes of risk adjustment; capping the maximum amount cms-hierarchical condition categories (hcc) risk scores can increase or decrease over the length of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreement period to \u00e2\u00b1 3 percent. nhmg fully supports the elimination of the distinction between newly and continuously assigned patients when calculating cms-hcc risk scores. the current methodology of allowing risk scores to increase for newly assigned patients based on hccs while only allowing risk scores to increase for continuously assigned patients based on demographic factors is flawed and does not adequately account for changes in health characteristics for acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 assigned beneficiaries. we encourage cms to include the elimination of this distinction in the 2018 mssp/aco final rule.\n however, nhmg believes that the proposed cap of \u00e2\u00b1 3 percent over the length of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 5-year agreement period does not fully address the issues with mssp risk adjustment. while a positive step toward appropriately capturing the complexity of assigned aco patients, nhmg encourages cms to consider a cap of at least \u00e2\u00b1 5 percent.\n decreasing the maximum amount of the regional adjustment in an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark to 50 percent and incorporating a national-regional blended trend rate. nhmg agrees with other acos and cms in their assertions that the current methodology for incorporating regional adjustments into the aco benchmarking methodology is in need of reform. however, we feel that the removal of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries from the regional reference population would be the most effective way to improve this methodology. particularly for acos in rural areas with higher market penetration in the counties that define their region, maintaining an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries in the regional reference population limits an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to achieve positive performance in reducing costs below their benchmarks. this is due to the fact that if an aco reduces costs for its own assigned beneficiaries, they would also reduce their own benchmark \u00e2\u0080\u0093 creating a flawed system in which acos are competing against themselves rather than other acos and organizations in their region. therefore, we encourage cms to consider the removal of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries from its regional reference population as an alternative to improving regional adjustments in the benchmarking methodology.\n eliminating aco-11 measure from the list of required of mssp quality measures. as utilization of ehr technology is a foundational piece of improving the quality of care, reducing overall costs, and creating a remarkable patient experience, nhmg applauds the removal of aco-11 from the list of required measures in the mssp. this proposed change alleviates administrative burden on clinicians, and we encourage cms to finalize this change as proposed.\n allowing acos greater flexibility in selecting the method of beneficiary assignment. nhmg supports the ability of acos to select either prospective or retrospective beneficiary assignment as codified in the bipartisan budget act of 2018, and encourages cms to finalize this change as proposed.\n granting acos currently participating in the mssp the flexibility to complete their current agreement period under existing program rules. nhmg supports the ability for acos to remain in their current mssp track under existing program rules through the end of their current agreement period. we encourage cms to finalize this change as proposed.\n 4 thank you again for the opportunity to provide comments on the 2018 mssp/aco proposed rule.

medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6pathways to success\n dear administrator verma:\n\n on behalf of the national association of community health centers (nachc), we would like to take this opportunity the express the interest federally qualified health centers (referred to here as fqhcs, or \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3health centers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5) have in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\n\n nachc is the national membership organization for federally qualified health centers (fqhcs or \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3health centers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5). with over 1,400 organizations and more than 11,000 sites nationwide, health centers are non-profit, community-directed providers that serve as the primary medical home for over 28 million patients, including 1 in 6 medicaid beneficiaries. health centers serve as the largest primary care network in the country providing comprehensive services in all 50 states and u.s. territories. for more detail on health centers, please see attachment a.\n\n nachc welcomes the opportunity to respond to cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 pathways to success nprm. while nachc believes the proposed rule includes important steps toward increased success, there are also several areas where we raise caution and seek clarification. in summary, our comments will focus on the following areas:\n\n e health centers are important partners in accountable care arrangements, producing cost savings for the system and enhanced quality of care for beneficiaries and look forward to continuing this work together.\n\n e cms should invest in a more gradual pathway to increased levels of financial risk for provider- led accountable care organizations (acos).\n\n e many fqhcs, because they provide care to some of the most underserved communities in the country, require additional investment to prepare for two-sided risk arrangements.\n\n e increased flexibility in the ability to provide telehealth services will support health centers participating in the pathways to success program.\n\n e amore appropriate benchmarking process will support participating health centers in delivering the best care for the vulnerable populations they serve.\n\n e cms should be mindful of inadvertently causing \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3cherry-picking\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 of patients by allowing acos to provide beneficiary incentives.\n\n health centers are important partners in accountable care arrangements, producing cost savings for the system and enhanced quality of care for beneficiaries.\n\n today, health centers across the country, in both rural and urban settings, participate in a variety of value-based and accountable care initiatives. health centers pride themselves on the high quality of care that they deliver. studies show that health centers are leaders in primary care and consistently perform better on a wide range of ambulatory care quality measures than private physicians, exceeding medicaid managed care organization high performance benchmark scores in areas including diabetes control, blood pressure control, and pap tests.?\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 they do this while achieving significant cost savings \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 nearly $24 billion annually to the health care system.?\n\n additionally, health centers are on the leading edge of primary care practice transformation and innovation. over 70 percent of health centers are nationally recognized patient center medical homes. many are working toward integrated models of care, taking a patient-centered approach to providing behavioral health and substance use disorder services. in 2017 alone, health centers provided almost 11 million visits for mental health and substance abuse services. health centers are also meaningfully leveraging technology as part of their practice transformation efforts with nearly 100 percent of the total health centers utilizing an electronic health record (ehr) system, and 57 percent of health centers across the country using telehealth or are in the process of implementing a telehealth program.\n\n cms should invest in a more gradual pathway to increased levels of financial risk for provider-led accountable care organizations (acos).\n\n many health centers are actively engaging in value-based and accountable care initiatives, outlined further in attachment b. health center participation in these models \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 ranging from acos to multi-payer initiatives \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 have demonstrated cost-savings and high-quality outcomes. in fact, a review of the 2014 mssp performance year found that 44 percent of provider-led acos that included at least one fqhc achieved shared savings compared to just 28 percent of all acos.\n furthermore, health centers often participate in provider-led acos, and these acos in both upside-only and two-sided risk arrangements saved more money in performance year 2017 than acos in only two-sided risk arrangements ($0.182 billion versus $0.033 billion, a difference of nearly $150 million).* clearly, health centers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 record of cost-efficient, high quality and comprehensive care health centers provide makes them powerful drivers of cost savings in accountable care arrangements.\n\n\n\n 1 goldman, le et al. federally

(june 2010).\n\n 4 source: cms analysis. data for performance year 2016. a negative net impact means program savings; a positive net impact means program costs.\n\n as health centers often operate on razor thin margins, it can be challenging for them to take ona two-sided risk arrangement and, most especially, the high level of financial risk proposed in the pathways to success \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3enhanced\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 track. an investment of time and resources is required to adapt new models of care and develop new financial relationships with other providers. for many health centers, the two years cms proposes to allow for that investment through upside-only, shared savings arrangements is not sufficient. the claims data from medicare often arrives months after the fact, but this data is vital to health centers, which must adjust their care model to produce the highest quality outcomes and bend the cost curve. nachc appreciates cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 recognition of the additional time many provider-led acos may need to transition to higher levels of two-sided risk by allowing provider-led acos to cycle through the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3basic\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 track for two agreement periods. however, this still only allows provider-led acos two years without taking on financial risk. due to the pace of data sharing and the imperative to transform care models, nachc recommends cms allow provider-led acos an even more gradual pathway to two-sided risk. specifically, nachc recommends cms allow provider-led acos a minimum of three years in the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3basic\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 track in an upside-only arrangement then have the option to enter into a new agreement with cms.\n\n because health centers provide care to some of the most underserved communities in the country, they often require additional investment to prepare for two-sided risk arrangements.\n\n health centers provide services to some of the most underserved and vulnerable populations in the country including a disproportionate share of the country\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s most economically disadvantaged \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 71 percent of health center patients live at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty line.\n health centers participating in shared savings arrangements have been able to leverage those dollars to continue transforming care for their patients \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 expanding needed services, investing in telehealth infrastructure, hiring providers despite serious workforce shortages, and opening new access points in areas of need. all of these activities are essential to ensure that health centers operating in two-sided risk arrangements are able to successfully maintain and even enhance the quality of care they provide. as such, nachc recommends that for provider-led acos, cms increase the shared savings rate in years 1 and 2, the upside-only years of the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3basic\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 track, to at least 35 percent. this would enable health centers, who provide care in some of the most underserved communities in the country, to best prepare for a two-sided risk arrangement in subsequent years of the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3basic\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 track and in the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3enhanced\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 track.\n\n increased flexibility in the ability to provide telehealth services will support health centers participating in the pathways to success program.\n\n the key to health centers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 success in care transformation and cost-effectiveness is the unique health center model. this includes a commitment to serve all individuals who come through their doors regardless of their ability to pay, the provision of a broad array of primary and preventative services under one roof, and a patient-controlled boards of directors that ensure accountability to the community.\n\n at the same time, health centers are often at the forefront of technology advances, with 57 percent of health centers either currently using telehealth or in the process of implementing a telehealth program. the proposed provisions related to increased provider flexibility, in particular allowing acos to provide and be reimbursed for telehealth services, will help health centers continue to meet the unique needs of their communities in the most cost-efficient ways.\n however, while the preamble to the proposed rule outlines the process for which a provider can be reimbursed for his or her telehealth work, it is not clear how this new provision will impact health centers. health centers are currently limited to serving as originating sites only and are not able to provide or be reimbursed as a distant site in medicare. the preamble and proposed rule make reference to \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3physicians and providers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 using the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s tin, however it is not clear if this provision will allow health centers to fully participate in the telehealth provisions. nachc encourages cms to clarify the language in the proposed rule in order to clearly allow health centers to provide this valuable service through their work in an aco.\n\n a more appropriate benchmarking process will support participating health centers in delivering the best care for the vulnerable populations that they serve.\n\n under current policies applicable to establishing the benchmark for acos beginning a second or subsequent agreement period in 2017 and later years, cms replaces the national trend factor with regional trend factors, using a phased approach to adjust the rebased benchmark to reflect a percentage of the difference between the aco's historical expenditures and ffs expenditures in the aco's regional service area, depending on whether the aco is found to have lower or higher spending compared to its regional service area. ultimately a weight of 70 percent will be applied in calculating the regional adjustment for all acos beginning no later than the third agreement period in which the aco's benchmark is rebased using this methodology, unless the secretary determines that a lower weight should be applied.\n\n the proposed rule would incorporate regional expenditures, including the regional adjustment and regional trend and update factors, in the benchmark established for an aco's first agreement period. however, the proposed rule applies two policies to limit the magnitude of the adjustment:\n (1) reducing the weight that is applied to the adjustment from a maximum of 70 percent to a maximum of 50 percent and (2) imposing an absolute dollar limit on the adjustment. the reason for those limitations is due to concern that, as the higher weights for the regional adjustment are phased in over time, the benchmarks for low-spending acos may become overly inflated to the point where these organizations need to do little to maintain or change their practices to generate savings, resulting in potential windfall gains to lower-cost acos.\n\n while nachc supports incorporating regional expenditures in the benchmark established for an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first agreement, nachc is concerned that the two proposed policies to limit the magnitude of the adjustment undermines the policy goals. as cms has recognized, the incorporation of regional expenditures provides an aco with a benchmark that is more reflective of ffs spending in the aco's region than a benchmark based solely on the aco's own historical expenditures. this approach creates stronger financial incentives for acos that have been successful in reducing expenditures to remain in the program, thus improving program sustainability. it also allows cms to better capture the cost experience in the aco's region, the health status and socio-economic\n dynamics of the regional population, and location-specific medicare payments when compared to using national ffs expenditures.\n\n nachc disagrees that higher weights for the regional adjustment results in potential windfall gains to lower-cost acos. those gains are not windfalls but compensate lower-cost acos for the work invested in practices to reduce the overall costs of care for medicare beneficiaries. in fact, a lower- cost aco composed of fqhcs may have higher expenditures for primary care due to the prospective payment system (pps) methodology as compared to regional expenditures for primary care services that are generally reimbursed under the medicare fee schedule. accordingly, nachc encourages cms to reconsider limiting the magnitude of the regional adjustment through an absolute dollar limit and in its place consider increasing the maximum weight applied to adjustments to 75 percent.\n\n cms should be mindful of inadvertently causing \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3cherry-picking\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 of patients by allowing acos to provide beneficiary incentives.\n\n fqhcs are unique in that they are both required by federal law and committed to serving everyone that seeks care and must serve communities most in need of care. they turn no patient away, regardless of income, insurance status, risk, or complexity. this open-door policy is a defining feature of the health center mission of providing quality, affordable access to care to all who need it. additionally, beneficiaries\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 freedom of choice is an important way for practices and payers, including medicare, to gauge practice effectiveness and the demand for access to health care services in specific communities. should cms decide to allow acos to incentivize beneficiaries, it should implement safeguards to ensure that higher-revenue acos do not inadvertently attract healthier patients, potentially skewing quality metrics and leaving sicker\n patients with fewer options.\n we also encourage cms to take appropriate measures to ensure that there are no anti-kickback or\n physician self-referral laws violated through this beneficiary incentive process.\n\n in closing, nachc appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on this important rule, and both our staff and our member health centers would be happy to provide any further information that would be helpful.\n\n sincerely,\n c

centers attachment a:\n\n overview of federally qualified health centers\n for over 50 years, health centers have provided access to quality and affordable primary and preventive healthcare services to millions of uninsured and medically underserved people nationwide, regardless of their ability to pay. at present there are almost 1,400 health centers with more than 11,000 sites.\n together, they serve over 28 million patients, including 8.4 million children and more than 1 in 6 medicaid beneficiaries.\n\n health centers provide care to all individuals, regardless of their ability to pay. all health centers provide a full range of primary and preventive services, as well as services that enable patients to access health care appropriately (e.g., translation, health education, transportation). a growing number of health centers also provide dental, behavioral health, pharmacy, and other important supplemental services.\n\n to be approved by the federal government as a health center, an organization must meet requirements outlined in section 330 of the public health service act. these requirements include, but are not limited to:\n\n e serve a federally-designated medically underserved area or a medically underserved population. some health centers serve an entire community, while other target specific populations, such as persons experiencing homelessness or migrant farmworkers.\n\n e offer services to all persons, regardless of the person\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s ability to pay.\n\n e charge no more than a nominal fee to patients whose incomes are at or below the federal poverty level (fpl).\n\n e charge persons whose incomes are between 101% and 200% fpl based on a sliding fee scale.\n\n e be governed by a board of directors, of whom a majority of members must be patients of the health center.\n\n most section 330 health centers receive federal grants from the bureau of primary health care (bphc)\n within hrsa. bphc\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s grants are intended to provide funds to assist health centers in covering the otherwise uncompensated costs of providing care to uninsured and underinsured indigent patients, as well as to maintain the health center\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s infrastructure. patients who are not indigent or who have insurance, whether public or private, are expected to pay for the services rendered. in 2017, on average, the insurance status of health center patients is as follows:\n\n e 49% are medicaid recipients e 23% are uninsured e 18% are privately insured\n e 9% are medicare recipients\n no two health centers are identical, but they all share one common purpose: to provide primary health care services that are coordinated, culturally and linguistically competent, and community-directed, to uninsured and medically underserved people.\n\n 20 ae if national association \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e3\u00b3 i community health centers attachment b:\n\n examples of health centers engaging in payment and delivery reform initiatives\n health centers nationwide are successfully engaging in a variety value-based initiatives in both medicare and medicaid. examples of such statewide and regional initiatives are provided below. in addition these larger initiatives, individual health centers also hold value-based agreements with payers including medicaid managed care organizations.\n\n health homes\n health centers in 14 states have been active participants in health homes programs implemented in their states.\n\n in missouri, the primary care association (which represents fqhcs) and the state medicaid agency collaboratively designed a state plan amendment to implement section 2703 of the aca. the pca monitors progress, provides solutions to implementation challenges, and provides quality coaching and population health tools and data analytics to improve performance. this health homes initiative is improving care coordination and service integration for individuals with chronic conditions while improving quality and reducing costs.\n\n multi-payer initiatives\n health centers have been engaged in the current multi-payer advanced primary care practice demonstrations hosted by the center for medicare and medicaid innovation. health centers are also participating in other state-based multi-payer initiatives.\n\n in ohio the department of medicaid, in conjunction with the office of health transformation, received the state innovation model grant to launch the ohio comprehensive primary care (cpc), an investment in primary care infrastructure intended to support improved population health outcomes. cpc is a patient-centered medical home program, which is a team-based care delivery model led by primary care practices that comprehensively manage patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 health needs. currently 20 ohio fqhc networks are participating in the first cohort, accounting for 57 of the 92 participating sites. this initiative will deliver a coordinated, comprehensive model that will improve the health of patients while aligning the method of payment to incentivize positive health outcomes.\n\n integrated networks (acos, ipas)\n\n health centers across the country are actively involved in accountable care organizations participating in the medicare shared savings program (mssp). these value-based partnerships are enabling health centers to be rewarded for the valuable primary and preventative care they provide and their long history of working with both clinical and non-clinical partners to deliver coordinated, cost-effective care.\n in performance year 2014, rti\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s evaluation of the mssp found that among participating acos that included at least one fqhc (with no hospital), 44% achieved shared savings compared to 28% of all acos.\n\n in kentucky, the primary care association (which represents fqhcs) formed an independent practice association (ipa) with fqhcs and rural health clinics (rhcs) in the state in 2011. the ipa focuses on building the support structure to enable participating fqhcs and rhcs to manage costs and improve the quality of care provided to patients. the ipa has established value-based contracts with medicaid managed care, medicare advantage, and commercial health plans. additionally, several of the kentucky fqhcs and rhcs have also worked with the pca to form a mssp aco, which is showing positive trends.\n\n in minnesota, ten fqhcs have formed a safety-net accountable care organization, federally qualified health center urban health network (fuhn), as part of the state\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s medicaid integrated health partnership program. to date, fuhn has saved minnesota and federal taxpayers over $16 million. these savings are a result of robust care coordination services and data analytics that reduced emergency department use by 20%. these results were achieved with the underlying fqhc pps structure in place.\n moreover, the state medicaid agency recently recommended updating the fqhc pps rates to recognize their investments in value-based care.\n\n in vermont, seven fqhcs formed an accountable care organization, community health accountable care (chac). chac entered into shared savings arrangements with medicare, vermont medicaid, and blue cross and blue shield of vermont in 2014. in its first year as an aco, chac saved vermont $7.8 million in medicaid health care costs and received $3.35 million through the shared savings program agreement. since its inception, chac\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s network has grown to include 10 fqhcs, 4 rural health clinics, 7 hospitals, 14 mental health and specialized services designated agencies, and 9 certified home health agencies. the fqhcs continue to be actively engaged in the payment and delivery reform efforts in the state as vermont looks to transition to an all-payer aco model.\n\n\n", "0376": "comments from richmond good help aco, llc - dr. john mccurley\nni. bon secours \n october 16, 2018\nms. seema verma \n ni 1 0 bon secours believes that high revenue acos are

maryland 21244-8013\n submitted electronically to www.regulations.gov\n dear administrator verma:\n thank you for the opportunity to provide athenahealth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective on the medicare shared savings program (mssp) \u00e2\u0080\u009cpathways to success\u00e2\u0080\u009d proposed rule.\n over the last twenty-one years, athenahealth has built a network of over 115,000 providers who care for 110 million patients in both the acute and ambulatory settings. we provide electronic health record (\u00e2\u0080\u009cehr\u00e2\u0080\u009d), practice management, care coordination, patient communication, data analytics, and related services to physician practices and hospitals. consistent with our model in which all of our customers use a single instance of our cloud- based application, we have aspired to connect with partners across the care continuum to enable our clinicians to improve the quality of care they deliver while demonstrating success in cms programs.\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts in the mssp proposed rule to foster a more accountable healthcare marketplace, while promoting interoperability through the wider adoption of ehr technology. our healthcare ecosystem must incentivize the seamless exchange of information and financial responsibility to achieve meaningful cost reduction.\n as cms continues to identify opportunities to overhaul the status quo in healthcare, we believe that the agency should continue its effort to reduce physician burden, focus on outcomes and promote interoperability. to advance these goals, we encourage cms to consider the following:\n\n1. increase alignment across quality reporting requirements \n\n athenahealth believes cms should examine all rulemaking with an eye towards reducing physician documentation burden and enabling innovative technologies to enter the market to support that mission. we believe that replacing meaningful use electronic health record quality measures with aco attestation that the majority of eligible clinicians use cehrt will add value to aco participants. however, cms should also be cognizant of the fact that, while the adoption of cehrt is certainly important to the success of acos, technologies falling outside of the scope of cehrt also contribute to success in two-sided risk programs. as cms continues to develop mssp quality measures as part of the meaningful measures initiative and those that would assess opioid utilization, we request that cms streamline these requirements with other medicare programs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and non-medicare programs when possible \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to reduce data collection and duplicative physician work. we also propose that cms avoid selecting a quality measure that is prohibitively difficult to calculate and track, particularly if such measures have not been proven to drive meaningful improvement in patient outcomes.\n\n2. reduce financial barriers for low-revenue acos to participate in mssp \n\n 2 cms has indicated that low-revenue, physician-led acos generate more savings for medicare, on average, than high-revenue acos. as the agency seeks to ensure that mssp remains accessible and attractive for smaller and lower-revenue acos, we encourage the agency to minimize financial barriers to entry. below are several recommendations to streamline cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data-sharing and reporting processes to lower costs incurred by acos and their technology partners.\n as athenahealth has experienced firsthand, the necessary investment in healthcare it systems is not an insignificant business decision for these low-revenue acos, which often exist on razor-thin margins. from athenahealth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience, financial hurdles for forming an aco have often deterred prospective groups from participating in mssp. alternatively, we have also experienced low-revenue acos successfully join mssp and demonstrate a real value add to patient outcomes amidst constraining financial situations. cms should continue to identify ways to allow private sector innovation to lower barriers of participation for physicians and technology vendors who partner with acos to demonstrate savings.\n currently, the operational complexity of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data sharing and reporting processes, as well as a lack of consistency in data formats, requires that technology vendors significantly invest in understanding and adjusting to changes. there is a real opportunity cost associated with this. every dollar that is spent untangling the complexities of mssp is routed away from innovation which improves outcomes at a lower cost \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the explicit purpose of this program. together, the following recommended changes would increase efficiency for vendors to ingest, render, and extract data on behalf of mssp acos and enable improved outcomes and greater cost savings.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 streamline cms data-sharing today, cms sends a quarterly package of information, including beneficiary assignment files (qassgns) and financial reporting, which is distinct from the monthly claim and claim line feed files (cclfs). we recommend that cms send the quarterly beneficiary package with updated eligibility each month with the cclf set. this change would enable vendors to manage a single set of data per cycle, allow for a more thorough and timely review of eligibility and client metrics, and eliminate the work of maintaining a member month creation model that infers membership based on a variety of factors.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 improve transparency and consistency of standards for cms data files current ambiguity around cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s logic for certain reports, such as the qexpu reports, creates substantial work for providers and vendors who are required to \u00e2\u0080\u009cback into\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms calculations. we recommend that cms either provide the reports monthly and/or provide acos with the necessary information to calculate this independently\n(e.g. non-claims-based payments, non-data-sharing financials, substance abuse \n claims).\n additionally, cms does not share documentation of the cclf and beneficiary eligibility data model with data vendors. we request that cms provide a schema diagram, entity relationships, and detailed description of data elements before they are combined or calculated, which would provide vendors more insight into how key fields and calculations are related and derived, which would allow more efficient and accurate mapping and reporting.\n 3 responsible provider associated with the beneficiary for the month in the cclf8 file and qassgns. this change would eliminate the work of determining and maintaining an attribution model that attempts to mimic cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 suggestions.\n additionally, cms should provide beneficiary addresses in either the qassgn or cclf files, which it currently does not, to improve efficiency in patient matching and reduce the need for manual patient merges.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 update gpro processes\n o extend file format lead time we request that cms send the file format specifications and sample data with more lead time - a minimum of 12 weeks before receipt of clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 files - to ensure that vendors have adequate time to plan for changes without disrupting client- facing initiatives, update systems to accommodate changes to file formats, and adjust operational processes that support clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reporting needs.\n additionally, we request that cms offer a testing environment in which vendors may upload submission test files and test the gpro ui to ensure compliance with the required specifications, rather than relying on clients to test submission files with phi after the reporting period has begun.\n we also ask that cms minimize year-by-year changes to gpro, only providing updates that offer clear, demonstrable benefit for participating providers and their technology partners. this will help drastically reduce the hours dedicated to explaining the interpretations of these measures and last-minute resource diversion. when changes are made, we ask that cms communicate them in a consistent and well-publicized manner to all stakeholders.\n o adopt a consistent, clear measure specification format today, cms has defined at least three different versions of each of their measures: machine-readable (ecqm), claims-based, and user reported (web interface/gpro). while we believe the ecqm is the source for the web interface specification, there are differences between the versions that suggest human error is at play. additionally, because cms sends measure specifications in a narrative format, both vendors and participating acos must interpret the narrative. this requires substantial effort to translate into code in order to enable tracking and monitoring on the measures, which makes it, too, prone to human error.\n we ask that the web interface stay true to the ecqm version of each measure, rather than provide a separate, narrative version of the specification. this will ensure that vendors supporting acos can code the measures accurately and avoid ambiguous, time-intensive work of interpreting and coding the measures. using the ecqm version would make automated reporting possible for provider organizations. automation would help providers eliminate administrative work (staff are needed to validate each measure and input) and reduce human error. in turn, fewer errors will reduce work needed during the reporting period to make corrections and other changes.\n 4 patient-level care gaps and empower them to provide higher quality of care. cms should encourage a more comprehensive perspective of patient health by incorporating data from all valid sources in the gpro submission process.\n o allow health technology vendors to submit aco clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gpro data currently, technology vendors are not provided access to submit data to the gpro interface on behalf of their aco clients. this results in either time-intensive effort of the clients themselves and/or the payment for temporary staff and service agencies to complete the submission. to relieve this undue burden on aco participants, cms should allow technology vendors to easily send quality measure data directly to the agency via industry-standard api.\n o adopt standard formats for export data and ingesting patient data the unique data ingestion format required for the gpro reporting process creates a substantial amount of work for vendors to reformat our exported data into a format that can be submitted. we recommend that cms use an industry-standard format for ingesting patient data. this should not be limited to mssp participants, but ideally apply to all medicare reporting programs.\n\n3. share prescription drug cost data to enabling more comprehensive cost \n tracking and reporting\n cms does not currently share information about prescription costs (e.g. ingredient cost, dispensing fee, coinsurance, copay, deductible, allowable, etc.). to further increase transparency in healthcare, we request that cms add prescription cost fields to the existing part d cclf file, including beneficiary payment information. this transparency would allow for improved analysis of pharmaceutical spending and the deployment of cost saving measures across aco participants, enabling them to achieve greater medicare savings.\n in closing, we believe the proposed mssp changes are a logical next step in the transition to value based care. we urge cms to use caution when implementing changes quickly and consider the role that technology vendors play as partners to their clients who participate in a variety of agency programs. technology vendors sit in a unique position to greatly lower the costs and improve the quality of care their physician clients deliver when they are free to innovate and compete on value of services delivered. athenahealth looks forward to working together with you on these important issues. please do not hesitate to reach out via email at

beneficiaries; and policies on voluntarv alignment. as a track 3 aco, the only aco in puerto rico (pr) and after having experienced the direct impact of a major natural disaster, we raise our concern

application process for renewing acos, since cms is proposing 'the introduction of a monitoring approach and evaluation'- ariterion, related to financial performance, we recommend for ac: os that have successfully demonstrated positive results, in accordance with new criteria, to undergo an exp,edite application process. cms should provide for these acos a form such as a \"notice of intent to

clarification, keeping in mind that an aco is a model for provision of services; a contractual form in which the provider agrees to offer the best quality of service to their patients at a lower cost. we would also like to point out that the relationship between a beneficiary and their physicians does not translate to a direct relationship with the aco. opt-in seems contrary to ffs beneficiaries' preferences, as it proposes a system significantly similar to ma, which can have the effect of reducing ffs and acos population. we are strongly opposed to opt-in as caribbean accountable care, along with other acos, are in a high ma market share penetration area and the opt-in effect will greatly impact our capacity to sustain the minimum number of assigned beneficiaries. section proposed rule\n1. beneficiary \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 allow certain acos to each \n incentives establish a beneficiary incentive program for assigned beneficiaries who receive qualifying primary-care services to

establish ing and resetting aco's benchmarks, we favor the use of a blended national and regional trend factors, as long as ffii are exclusively acos ffs for the reginal trend factor. our recommendation is that cms takes into consideration hi,~h ma penetration areas upon the application of the proposed methodology for calculating growth rates used in establishing, resetting, and updating the benchmarks. our concern applies to other regions as well (in addition to pj; .), as this may become a potential problem, ffs and aco populations will get smaller with higher ma market penetration and therefor~ any comparison including ma would not reflect a true ffs comparative. in addition, pr has the lowest ffs of all us states and territories, therefore the trending and the limiting of the trending, considering ffs anomaly in pr will be potentially hurtful. for example, when comparing professional* and ip* payment rates in pr vs. fl (miami) ancl ny (queens), we found that: fl rates are 119% higher on professional and 152% higher on ip, and ny rates are 128% higher on professional and 184% higher on ip. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 please note that for both professional and facility we ore assuming a certain mix of services, and the ratio would change depem ling on that mix. for professional, we used a snapshot of ma data. far ip, we used national figures weighting on the top 10 drgs. section proposed rule\n2. risk adjustment \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 eliminate distinction between \n caribbean accountable care of national and regional update factors to update the historical benchmark for the py.\ne. updating program policies \n caribbean accountable care shared losses, but the effects of hurricanes irma and maria did reduce our shared savings substantially, negatively impacting our py 2017 finances. in addition, py 2018 is carrying over the high costs a~ sociated with beneficiaries accessing services in the mainland in an unusual rate due to, in some cases, forced migration that followed the natural disasters. not adapting the recommended changes could ultimately have the indirect effect of placing acos in financial difficulty, especially those being proposed as a low-revenue acos that are dependent on their shared savings to maintain their operations. caribbean accountable care cms financial reconciliation report for py 2017 states that the share of beneficiaries in disaster-affected counties was 98.05% and the share of year affected by disaster was set at 33.33% (or 4 months, sep\u00e2\u00ad dec), which demonstrates the impact and longing effect this natural disasters had on the li;land. pr saw a historically high number of its residents migrating to the continental us during the months follow,ing the hurricanes. the us bureau of transportation statistics (bts) reported in october 2017 alone 85,502 people left pr, after normalization of air transport between pr and the mainland. a more complete picture was provided by the american community survey (acs) which concluded that 135,592 puerto ricans had actually relocated stateside ,r~er hurricane maria. in our opinion, acos are being held responsible for reductions in shared savings result ing from the catastrophic events. in our case, the events that occurred in september 2017 were outside of our aco control but resulted in an increase in utilization and an increase in services rendered outside of puerto rico. in addition, in terms of the cms promoting interoperability proposal, we are in agreement with the elimination of ac0-11 and moving towards the requirement that all acos demonstrate a specified level of certified electronic health record technology {cehrt). we recommend that cms not make an unnecessary distinction in an area such as cehrt and are opposed to the different levels of percentages proposed; we instead propose that 50% should be the target that applies to all and then gradually increase over time. section proposed rule aco

washington, dc 20201 submitted electronically via www.regulations.gov\n re: medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success (cms-1701-p)\n dear administrator verma:\n on behalf of amita health, i appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed rule entitled medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations- pathways to success1.\n amita  health  is  the  largest  health system  in  illinois,  operating  19  hospitals  and  more  than  230 primary and specialty care sites throughout the state. we work with more than 7,900 employed and contracted physicians and employ more than 26,000 associates. as a faith-based organization, we are committed to providing compassionate, holistic care to all, with an emphasis on serving the poor and vulnerable.\n amita health is a joint operating company formed by adventist midwest health, part of adventist health system in altamonte springs, florida, and st. louis, missouri-based ascension. adventist health system is focused on whole-person health and a commitment to making communities healthier across the system's 46 hospital service areas in nine states. ascension health is the largest non- profit health system in the u.s. and the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest catholic health system with over 2,600 sites of care in 22 states.\n amita health currently operates or participates in two medicare shared savings program (mssp) accountable  care  organizations  (acos), serving approximately 57,500 medicare  beneficiaries nationwide. in performance years 2016 and 2017, these two amita health acos achieved over $115 million  in  savings  through  the  mssp. in  light  of  this  experience,  and  our  shared  goal  of expanding the  availability of  high-performing  acos,  we  offer  the  following  comments  and recommendations for cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consideration.\n\n\n\n 2\n\ni. support for benefits afforded to two-sided risk models \n\n amita health believes that the proposed rule includes several themes and provisions that will play a key role in reducing total cost of care, improving patient centered care, and increasing quality. we know cms is well-aware that administrative costs for acos are significant. quality improvement staff, data  and  analytics,  information  technology  systems,  care  managers,  and  care  coordinators  are common investments made by aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to achieve success in the program. considering the significant investments being made by all mssp acos, regardless of the track or level that they might qualify for under the proposed rule, we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to make the following benefits available to basic track acos and levels c and beyond: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 waiver of the skilled nursing facility (snf) three-day rule; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 waiver of the telehealth services originating site and geographic requirements; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 enhanced beneficiary engagement tools.\n\nii. permitting annual participation elections \n\n amita health supports the proposal to permit annual election of beneficiary assignment methodology as  it  will  provide  acos  the  flexibility  to  innovate  their  care  coordination  efforts,  increasing  the likelihood they develop a cost-effective care coordination model that results in shared savings.\n prospective  and  retrospective  assignment  methodologies  have  unique  features  that  impact  the delivery of care management services. for example, prospective attribution allows for more strategic and cost-efficient outreach activities than retrospective attribution because the aco has knowledge up  front  of  the  members  they  are  responsible  for  managing.  conversely,  retrospective  attribution helps ensure that the final expenditure amount used in the shared savings calculation reflects patients that in fact received a plurality of primary care from a provider participating in the aco during the performance year. affording acos the flexibility to choose between assignment methodologies will allow for enhancements to care delivery and population management that result from prior learnings. however,  we  echo  concerns  raised  by  the  track  3  collaborative  in  their  comment  letter  and encourage cms to use a singular assignment window and methodology to determine the assigned population for the entire calendar year 2019.\n we have  concerns  about  a truncated  6-month extension  period  as  well  as  the  uncertainty  of  the benchmarking and run rate comparisons.  we encourage cms to allow all acos with participation agreements ending december 31, 2018 the opportunity to elect to extend their agreement period by a 12-month performance year from january 1, 2019, to december 31, 2019, rather than the current proposal to extend 6-months to june 30, 2019, on their current tracks and install these changes to the program effective january 1, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3\n\niii. benchmarking methodology refinements \n\n\na. risk  adjustment  methodology  for  adjusting  historical  benchmark  each \n performance year\n we agree with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries. we also support the proposal to apply a symmetrical cap to changes in risk scores over the course of the agreement period. the current distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries makes it difficult for acos to predict how their financial performance may be affected by risk adjustment and does not allow benchmarks to vary with changes in health status that are not attributable to coding initiatives.\n however, in light of the proposal to extend contract periods from three years to five, we urge cms to reconsider whether three percent is the appropriate risk ratio cap for all performance years. instead, we believe an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk ratio cap should be increased incrementally for each performance year. for example, the risk ratio cap in the first performance year could be established at one percent and could increase annually through performance year five (topping out at five percent). this approach would better reflect the likelihood that the relative morbidity of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries will change. in  addition,  this  approach  would  better  address  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  concerns  regarding  upcoding  initiatives because the risk ratio cap in early performance years would be less than the risk ratio cap in later performance years.\n alternatively, we urge cms to reconsider the five-year contract period proposed in section ii.a.2 of the  proposed  rule.  we  are  concerned  that  the  length  of  the  contract  term  in  relation  to  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed  risk  ratio  cap  is  too  long  to  properly  reflect  changes  in  the  attributes  of  the  assigned beneficiary population.\n regardless of the approach finalized, we strongly urge cms to provide acos with the data used by the agency to develop benchmarks. providing stakeholders with this data would allow them to replicate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s methodology and improve their understanding of their own benchmark. the lack of clarity into the benchmark is a serious financial risk that, for many acos, may deter against continued participation in the program.\n in addition, we urge cms to provide detailed information regarding the expenditures associated with patients  involved  in  more  than  one  alternative  payment  model  (apm).  without  the  transparency afforded by receiving such data, it is difficult\u00e2\u0080\u0094if not impossible\u00e2\u0080\u0094for acos to understand the financial impact of these overlapping programs. in addition, the lack of complete expenditure data gives the impression that cms may not apply their patient overlap policies consistently, undermining efforts of apm  participants  to  coordinate  and  enter  into  risk-sharing  arrangements.  we  believe  such  risk- sharing  arrangements  would  improve  overall  financial  performance  for  apm  participants  by eliminating waste in care management efforts stemming from multiple parties attempting to manage the same patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care.\n\n\n\n\n 4\n\nb. use of regional factors when establishing and resetting acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benchmarks \n\n we  appreciate  cms  considering  changes  to  the  benchmark  methodology  that  will  more  fully recognize both the acuity of the attributed population and regional efficiency. many low cost, efficient providers have struggled to produce results below aggressive benchmarks and this proposal should provide significant relief, particularly for new entrants. however, the proposal to limit the full positive regional  trend  adjustment from  70  percent  to  50  percent  seems  to  limit  the  potential for  low  cost systems  relative  to  their  peers.  the  proposal  also  places  an  arbitrary  cap  of  5%  of  the  average expenditures by enrollment type. we encourage cms to reconsider the cap proposal. in addition, we encourage  cms  to  apply  a 70  percent  regional  trend  adjustment,  consistent  with  prior  cms regulations.\n\niv. fee-for-service (ffs) benefit enhancements: shared savings program snf 3-day \n rule waiver\n the proposed change related to applicability of the snf 3-day rule waiver, based on one primary care service received in the prior quarter, appears to offer a significant advantage to acos electing the retrospective assignment methodology. the proposed rule effectively opens up the waiver to the majority of the ffs medicare panel for mssps with retrospective assignment, while keeping the rules in  place  for  mssps  selecting  prospective  assignment  methodologies.  we  encourage  cms  to consider  providing  the  same  opportunity  to  mssps  operating  under  prospective  assignment methodologies.\n\nv. empowering beneficiary choice: beneficiary notifications  \n\n under the proposed rule, cms  would require aco participants to notify beneficiaries about aco participation and voluntary alignment, among other information, at the point of care. specifically, the aco participant would be newly required to notify the beneficiary of his or her ability to, and the process  by  which,  he  or  she  may  identify  or  change  identification  of  a  primary  care  provider  for purposes of voluntary alignment. cms also proposes to require that aco participants provide this information to each medicare ffs beneficiary at the first primary care visit of each performance year. this requirement would be in addition to the existing requirement that aco participants post signage  with  relevant  information  in  participating  sites  and,  in  some  instances,  make  written notification available upon request. while we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to reduce burden by creating a template notice for acos to use, we remain concerned that this proposed requirement will still lead to significant additional administrative burden for participants and we encourage cms to reconsider this provision.\n\nvi. advance notice for and payment consequences of termination  \n\n\n\n 5\n acos expecting to generate savings are less likely to terminate early in the first place, there may be scenarios that force early termination. acos that generate savings to the program should not be penalized for making such decisions, given the investments made to participate and generate savings to the medicare program.\n\nvii. proposals for phase-in of performance-based risk in the basic track \n\n amita health supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow track 1 acos to enter the basic track at the b, c, d, or e level. we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flexibility regarding the varied tolerance for risk that individual track 1 acos may currently possess.\n however, amita health encourages cms to retain quality scores in the shared loss methodology calculation as part of the basic track. improved quality for medicare beneficiaries has always been a cornerstone of the program and should continue to be a vital part of both shared savings and shared loss calculations. we also encourage cms to reconsider the shared savings rate proposed for the basic track levels a through d. as noted above, acos must make significant upfront investments to realize success in the mssp and we believe a minimum 50% sharing rate would be equitable to the requisite investments made.  additionally, reducing the levels a & b percentage share of savings from the current level of 50% available for track 1 acos to the proposed 25% will disincentivize new entrants from joining the program. the reduction from 50% to 25% has a significant impact on the ability of acos to earn income to fund initiatives to further improve quality and drive down cost, and will inevitably be a significant factor in the reduction of the number of acos participating in the mssp program.\n many acos are growing through integration.  this is necessary because the administrative costs of supporting the aco efforts related to achieving the triple aim objectives are considerable.  as a result,  physicians  are  choosing  to  integrate  to  develop  certain  economies  of  scale  to  limit administrative  costs  related  to  the  focus  on  the  triple  aim.  the  high  revenue  concept  and  the acceleration towards  risk  bearing status  undermines  physicians  aligning  through  scale  to  remove administrative cost from the environment.\n viii. determining  participation  options  based  on  medicare  ffs  revenue  and  prior participation\n cms proposes to distinguish among acos based on their degree of control over total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for their assigned beneficiaries by identifying low revenue versus high revenue acos. we believe differentiating high and low revenue acos will lead to acos excluding acute facilities from participation over the long-term. keeping hospitals in the program is critical to reducing total cost of care and forces hospitals to reconsider their mission in terms of the care they provide.  we firmly believe transformation can only successfully occur when there is coordination across the continuum of care and we encourage cms to reconsider this proposed policy.\n\n\n 6\n remain in upside-only track b for 1.5 additional years.  also, these current track 1+ acos that are defined as high revenue are further disadvantaged by being forced into the enhanced track after only 1 year of performance-based risk.  independent of whether they are identified by cms as high or low revenue acos, all current track 1+ acos should be permitted to extend their contracts in level e of the basic track for the full 5-year contract to continue to gain experience with performance base risk.\n conclusion\n amita health thanks you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule. if you have any questions, please contact david hurter, vice president, government programs and alternative payment methods, amita health at 847-493-4726 or

to success\n dear administrator verma,\n the oncology nursing society (ons) appreciates the opportunity to provide its perspective on cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposals aimed at redesigning and providing a new direction for the medicare shared savings program (mssp) accountable care organizations (acos).\n specialty designation for advance practice registered nurses (aprns) ons remains concerned that all advance practice registered nurses (aprns) are \u00e2\u0080\u009clumped\u00e2\u0080\u009d into a single \u00e2\u0080\u009cspecialty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which significantly impacts cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to appropriately attribute quality and resource use to specialized nurse practitioners delivering care to medicare beneficiaries. while most  entities  will  be  concerned  with  specialty  designation  for  aprns  in  the  context  of  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclusivity requirements, our concern is distinguishing the pivotal role oncology nurses play in delivering comprehensive care to medicare beneficiaries receiving care from acos.\n beyond  the  aco  program,  the  lack  of specialty designation  for  oncology aprns limits  the availability of objective medicare claims and other administrative data, thus preventing ons and other public  and  private stakeholders  from  conducting  important  analysis  on  the  impact  of oncology  nurses  on cancer care.  this  does  the  medicare  program,  its  beneficiaries, and  the oncology  nursing  profession,  a  great  disservice.  robust  analysis  and  evaluations,  including comparisons to other provider types, is essential for oncology nurses to continue raising the bar and improving cancer care and outcomes.\n we  urge  cms  to  develop  specialty  designation  codes  that  aprns  can  self-select  upon enrollment in the medicare program.\n emphasis on clinical data registries we note that few measures in the mssp aco program are devoted to cancer care, a significant concern given  the  impact  of  cancer  on  beneficiaries. despite  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099  efforts  to reduce administrative  burden  through  its  \u00e2\u0080\u009cpatients  over  paperwork\u00e2\u0080\u009d  and  \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeaningful  measures\u00e2\u0080\u009d initiatives, participants in acos should be engaged in quality improvement activities related to cancer care and delivery.\n ons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 oncology clinical data registry is a robust resource aimed at improving the quality of cancer care by  health  care  professionals  in  oncology. to  the  extent  oncology  practitioners  are  aco participants, they should be reporting to a specialized clinical data registry focused on improving cancer care treatment and delivery.\n to balance reduced quality measure reporting by acos and to facilitate aco improvements in specialty medical care, such as oncology, we urge cms to develop a measure that incentivizes reporting to clinical data registries, such as the ons oncology clinical data registry. this would limit the number of measures the aco is responsible for reporting while ensuring participants are working towards improving quality and outcomes in cancer care and delivery.\n\n sincerely,\n\n the oncology nursing society\n\n\n about ons the oncology nursing society (ons) is a professional organization of over 39,000 registered nurses and other healthcare providers dedicated to excellence in patient care, education, research, and administration in oncology nursing. ons members are a diverse group of professionals who represent a variety of professional roles, practice settings, and subspecialty practice areas. oncology nurses are leaders in the healthcare arena, committed to continuous learning and leading the transformation of cancer care by advocating for high-quality care for people with cancer.\n\n", "0381": "please find attached comments from the partnership to empower physician-led care (pepc). pepg\n partnership to empower

re: cms-1701-p; medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6pathways to success\n dear administrator verma:\n\n thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed changes to the medicare shared savings program (mssp). we believe that value-based care is a roadmap to sustainability for independent practice, and are pleased that the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) proposed changes that recognize the successes of physician-led accountable care organizations (acos).\n\n the partnership to empower physician-led care (pepc) is a membership organization dedicated to supporting value-based care to reduce costs, improve quality, empower patients and physicians, and increase access to care for millions of americans through a competitive health care provider market. we believe that it is impossible to achieve truly value-based care without a robust independent practice community. our members include aledade, american academy of family physicians (aafp), california medical association (cma), florida medical association, medical group management association (mgma), and texas medical association. we also have individual and small medical group supporters across the country, many of whom are independent physicians or practices and wish to remain so.\n\n as you know, physician-led acos have historically outperformed other types of acos. the advantages of independent practice are clear and include their adaptive culture, diversity of practice, ability to function as a laboratory for innovation in value-based care, and last but certainly not least, the fact that they are a lower cost, higher quality site of service for many health conditions.\n\n the evidence shows that physician-led acos have leveraged these advantages into cost savings and quality improvements. a september 2018 study published in the new england journal of medicine took a closer look at the

pathways to success should thus be to build on and scale the successes of physician-led acos. in the proposed rule, cms creates a distinction between \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3low\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 and \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3high\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 revenue acos. cms defines low revenue acos as small, physician-only, and rural acos whose participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue would be significantly less than total parts a and b expenditures for the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s assigned beneficiaries. cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s presumption is that the low and high revenue distinction will allow cms to move larger entities into arrangements with higher loss sharing limits, while allowing smaller, physician-led organizations to be eligible to transition to two-sided risk-bearing arrangements with more limited downside risk.\n\n we appreciate cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s efforts to distinguish between physician-led acos and acos led by larger entities.\n this is an improvement to the current mssp program, which treats all acos the same despite the clear evidence that low revenue, physician-led acos generate more savings than high revenue acos or next generation acos (see

revenue as the standard for this distinction may not achieve cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s desired goal and could be subject to gaming by acos. for example, an aco with a healthier patient population and fewer beneficiaries dually eligible for medicare and medicaid are likely to have lower levels of spending on higher cost services such as hospitalizations or post acute care than other acos. in that scenario, the aco participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 revenue will represent a higher share of total spending and the aco may appear to be \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3high revenue.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 cms should ensure that its methodology rewards acos who do a better job of controlling spending instead of emphasizing revenue. cms should also carefully monitor the types of acos qualifying for additional incentives offered only to specific types of acos, making adjustments as needed to ensure that benefits intended for physician-led acos are truly being received by the types of acos that cms intended to receive them.\n\n while our comments below focus on pathways to success, we do want to note that the results generated by physician-led acos bolster our belief that physicians can and should have the opportunity to lead value- based care models beyond existing models. as noted in our principles for value-based care (appendix a),\n\n\n ? levinson, daniel r. medicare program shared savings accountable care organizations have shown potential for reducing spending and improving quality. u.s. department of health and human services, aug. 2017, oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-15-00450.pdf.\n\n pepg\n partnership to empower physician-led care\n cms should consider the unique circumstances of physicians in independent practice when developing models, ensuring that there are options available for this cohort of the workforce and recognizing that models that are appropriate for large hospital-led groups and/or large physician practices may not be appropriate for all.\n\n with this background in mind, we offer the following recommendations for the evolution of the existing aco programs into pathways for success:\n\n\n1. werecommend that cms finalize proposals to adopt revenue-based risk under the basic track\n while continuing to offer physician-led acos the opportunity to spend adequate time in a one- sided, shared savings-only model.\n\n we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to adopt revenue-based risk in the basic track, aligning this participation option with the very popular track 1+ innovation center demonstration. with the exception of track 1+, to date, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s other two-sided aco models (track 2, track 3 and next generation aco) required physicians to take on levels of risk that were so high as to be a significant deterrent to program participation for independent physicians. the level of risk was not proportional to the finances of the entity leading the aco, and as a result, larger, hospital-led acos were proportionally allowed to take much smaller amounts of risk while smaller, physician-led acos were required to accept a level of risk that presented an existential threat to their practice.\n\n to increase participation in cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 aco initiatives and other value-based care programs, we previously recommended to cms that new models should allow physician practices to assume appropriate financial risk for reducing costs proportional to their finances while offering greater reward over time for practices agreeing to take on more risk. the proposed change aligns with our recommendation, and we believe it is the single most important thing cms can do to encourage independent physicians to participate in and take risk under pathways to success. we strongly urge cms to finalize this proposal.\n\n we further urge cms to continue to allow physician-led acos to spend adequate time in a one-sided, shared savings-only model. cms should balance its desire to push acos to take on risk faster with a recognition that it takes time for practices to adopt a value-based culture, make workflow adjustments and infrastructure improvements, and establish effective governance processes. we do not believe that two years in a one-sided model is adequate time to make all of the changes needed to convert from a fee- for-service to value-based culture and be ready to take downside risk.\n\n\n2. we recommend that cms incentivize physician-led acos to participate in pathways to success\n by increasing the minimum shared savings rate and reducing the minimum savings rate for these acos.\n\n given the data cited above regarding the superior results achieved by physician-led acos, we recommend that cms use all available policy levers to incentivize participation of these acos in pathways to success.\n this includes increasing the proposed shared savings rate beyond the proposed 25% for physician-led acos in the basic track, and offering a lower minimum savings rate.\n\n in the rule, cms proposes to dramatically drop the shared savings rate for acos entering the program in a one-sided model from 50% to 25% for the first year, gradually increasing the shared savings rate over\n pepg\n partnership to empower physician-led care\n the course of the five year performance period. the result is that acos that start at level a and work their way through the glidepath in the basic track will not realize the 50% shared savings rate until their fifth year in the program \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 a rate that is currently available to one-sided acos in their first year of the program.\n\n while we understand that cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 goal is to move acos to higher levels of risk and reward faster, we have strong concerns that dropping the minimum shared savings rate for acos in the basic track will significantly deter new acos, and especially physician-led acos, from entering the program. clinicians and practices seeking to start or join an aco must make significant practice changes and investments to position themselves for success in the program. for independent physicians, the potential reward for making these changes must be high enough to justify initial infrastructure costs, as well as ongoing investments in staff and other resources needed for population health management. these costs can add up to a substantial portion of their practice revenue. as a result, we recommend that cms maintain the current 50% minimum shared savings rate for one-sided physician-led acos in the basic track. this rate should increase over the course of the performance period.\n\n in addition to a higher shared savings rate, we encourage cms to offer a lower minimum savings rate to physician-led acos. it takes time \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 often a number of years \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 for acos to generate savings and reduce costs such that they are guaranteed to cross the minimum savings rate. this is a special challenge for physician-led acos because they need to achieve returns on investment to create the reserves needed to go to risk; they do not have the financial resources available to acos led by larger institutions. given this reality, we believe that cms could further incentivize participation in acos by physicians by lowering the minimum savings rate for physician-led acos in basic levels a and b by 2% from the current rate. this would support earlier transitions to risk while ensuring that cms is protected against instances where acos do not make investments and still receive savings payments.\n\n\n3. we support proposals to provide more predictable and accurate risk adjustment and\n benchmarks that work for physician-led payment models.\n\n under the current aco regulations, cms incorporates a regional adjustment into the benchmark during the second performance period. the proposed rule recognizes the value of this adjustment in setting accurate benchmarks for many acos, and proposes to incorporate the adjustment in the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first performance period. we believe strongly that efficient practices \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 such as many independent practices \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 should be rewarded for their efforts and incentivized to continue to improve quality and reduce costs. we support changes that create predictability and simplicity that will encourage efficient providers to participate and succeed under the program.\n\n we note, however, that cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed 5% cap on regional adjustment is low and recommend that cms modestly adjust its cap upward to 8%. an increase in the cap would be consistent with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s desire to promote physician-led acos, as it would improve the economics of participating in the program for the very type of acos that are most likely to generate savings and improve quality.\n\n 4. we recommend that cms remove an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries from the regional comparator.\n while we were pleased that cms proposed incorporating a regional adjuster into the benchmarking\n methodology earlier in the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s lifespan, we strongly recommend that cms remove an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries from the regional benchmark and trend. including an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries in the regional\n pepg\n partnership to empower physician-led care\n benchmark and trend has the practical effect of pitting the aco against itself, making it that much harder for the aco to realize savings and be comfortable taking on increasing amounts risk. the effect is disproportionately felt by rural acos, given that there are fewer patients included in the comparator. it is also acutely felt by independent physicians leading successful acos, as this policy effectively functions as a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3penalty\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 for their success. it is counterproductive to cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 goal of encouraging these providers to participate and assume greater amounts of risk as it essentially creates a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3headwind\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 that they must overcome to realize savings.\n\n\n5. we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to recognize positive and negative changes in patient health status,\n but recommend that cms allow for a slightly higher adjustment to capture outlier cases and create predictability.\n\n as you have undoubtedly heard many times, cms can encourage physician participation in pathways to success by creating predictability in the benchmark. recent data from the american academy of family physicians practice profile survey showed that one of the biggest barriers to value-based care adoption among family physicians continues to be the unpredictability of the revenue stream.\n\n one way to create predictability is to structure the benchmarking methodology to allow for modest changes in patient health status. we believe that predictability is of the utmost importance for physician- led acos, and were pleased that cms proposed up to a 3% positive or negative adjustment to account for changes in a patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 health status over the course of the performance period. this proposal strikes a balance between allowing for some variation while providing predictability and guarding against gaming.\n\n to further improve upon its proposal, cms could consider increasing the adjustment to up to 5% over the performance period. we believe that this change makes sense given that cms is proposing to extend the length of the performance period to five years, and that the advancing age of beneficiaries in the medicare population increases the chances that at least a portion of an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s attributed population will experience a significant change in health status over the course of the performance period. increasing the adjustment would capture additional outlier cases and reduce any incentives acos may have had to \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3lemon drop\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 sick patients or \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3cherry pick\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 healthy patients.\n\n\n6. we strongly encourage cms not to mandate beneficiary opt-in as a primary or sole mechanism\n for attributing patients to an aco.\n\n while cms did not propose to require beneficiary opt-in attribution in pathways to success, the proposed rule extensively described the methodology cms would use if it were to require or allow it in future years.\n cms also noted that it is seeking feedback on its methodology, and that it is considering scenarios under which beneficiary opt-in is a primary or sole mechanism for attributing patients to acos in future years.\n\n we strongly oppose a beneficiary opt-in mandate, and caution that such a requirement would effectively end physician participation in pathways to success. physician practices, especially those that are unaffiliated with a health system or health plan, do not have the resources needed to develop and implement the complex, continuous enrollment and reporting processes described in the proposed rule.\n such a requirement would significantly increase the costs of administering and running an aco, skewing the cost-benefit analysis many physician practices consider before joining the program. while the current\n pepg\n partnership to empower physician-led care\n process is not perfect, we urge cms to maintain claims-based attribution and voluntary alignment as the primary mechanism for assigned patients to an aco.\n\n * kkk *k\n please do not hesitate to reach out to me if the partnership to empower physician-led care can be a resource to you. | can be reached at

care\n physicians are best positioned to drive delivery system transformation. physicians \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 especially independent physician practices \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 are the lynch pin of our nation\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s health care system. they have repeatedly demonstrated their superior ability to generate positive results in value-based care arrangements, both in improved health outcomes and reduced costs. they are the most powerful tool we have to foster an affordable, accessible system that puts patients first.\n\n models should be accessible to a wide range of physicians, including physicians choosing to remain independent. as you know, the physician workforce is not homogenous. instead, there are physicians in large practices and small practices, in rural and urban settings, in a variety of different employment arrangements. cms should consider the unique circumstances of physicians in independent practice when developing models, ensuring that there are options available for this cohort of the workforce and recognizing that models that are appropriate for large hospital-led groups and/or large physician practices may not be appropriate for all.\n\n new models should allow physician practices to assume appropriate financial risk for reducing costs proportional to their finances while offering greater reward over time for practices agreeing to take on more risk. to attract independent practices, risk must be proportional to their finances and not so large as to favor consolidation of practices. an example of a recent model that is calibrated to reflect the financial realities faced by small physician practices is track 1+, which incorporates risk that is meaningful but not so large as to be an existential threat to a physician\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s business. cmmi should also provide more predictable and accurate risk adjustment and benchmarks that work for a range of physician practices.\n\n models should test a range of innovations aimed at encouraging consumers to engage in their care while not imposing substantial new administrative burdens or paperwork requirements on physician practices. in implementing new models, cms could consider a range of beneficiary- focused design elements including allowing medicare beneficiaries to voluntarily enroll in the model(s) with the primary care physician of their choice; or rewarding beneficiaries for decision- making that results in cost reductions by, for example, sharing in any savings obtained by the practice if the practice is participating in a shared savings model, receiving added benefits from their physicians and/or having their cost-sharing reduced or eliminated. as cms considers requiring practices to voluntarily enroll and/or recruit patients to participate in care models, we caution that this would be a significant barrier to participation for many independent practices.\n we urge cms to consider maintaining and improving processes for attributing patients based on historical claims for practices and clinicians that do not have the resources or desire to implement robust patient outreach and enrollment strategies.\n\n quality measures should be harmonized across new and existing models to the extent possible and cms should use a parsimonious list of meaningful measures that reduce the burden of reporting. quality measurement and improvement is of the utmost importance for value-based care, and should be incorporated into all alternative payment models, including physician-led models. we urge cms to harmonize measures across new and existing models, focusing on those measures that have the greatest impact on patient care.\n\n\n", "0382": "see attached october 15, 2018 seema verma administrator centers for medicare & medicaid services department of health & human services attention: cms-1701-p\np.o. box 8016 \n page 2 memorandum yet it is the experience of our aco in mssp that underscores the potential that enhanced physician and nurse practitioner engagement and improved care coordination among an interdisciplinary team offers to significantly transform medical care delivery ::or the majority of medicare beneficiaries we serve, those who are long-term care residents living in our nursing facilities. the value of the model has been borne out over many years in the institutional special needs plan (i-snps) within medicare advantage, though operationalizing this model through mssp affords the potential of significantly greater scalability, as over one m .llion traditional medicare beneficiaries currently reside in roughly 15,000 u.s. nursing homes. other programs that target the dual eligible population are primarily focused on expanding community-based supports to enable medicare beneficiaries to remain at home longer with gre 1ter potential at earlier stages of disease progression, while mssp can serve to address the complex needs of medicare beneficiaries already residing in long-term care settings many of vrhom are approaching the end of life. in fact, over 94 percent of genesis healthcare aco attributable beneficiaries live their remaining months and years within our centers withcut ever being discharged back to the community setting. in addition to improving care delivery for our residents, mssp has the pote1tial to expand access to care by providing an attractive opportunity for providers practicing in nu rsing facilities, who have limited available pathways to advanced payment models, to participate directly in a value\u00e2\u00ad based model. however, our ability to demonstrate the significant potential 1 hat exists through this program hinges on the continued thoughtful consideration of the effect these and future rule changes may have on medicare' s costliest population.\ni. accurate benchmark development \n page4 memorandum regional benchmarking impact limitation . . with the simultaneous introduction of regional benchmarking and mandatory nsk assumpt10n, we feel it is imperative that cms provide participants preliminary benchmarks prior to the deadline for submitting applications for participation in the mssp. providers' willingness to accept risk will be predicated upon their ability to forecast final benchmarks as precisely as possible, within margins of error that already incorporate potentially wide va.i.ability from risk scoring and trend factors. as an aco managing a complex and costly population with claims costs pet beneficiary nearly three times those of the average aco, a multiple which is not fully predicted by cms-hcc risk scores, we strongly support the proposed cap/floor related to the impact of regional benchmarking based on the flat dollar amount of national per capita fee-for-\u00e2\u00b7;ervice expenditures and recommend this amount be reduced from +/-5%.\nii. quality metrics appropriate for the population served \n page 5 memorandum mailed the survey. this approach results in extremely low sample size of resr onses and statistical insignificance. in fact, cahps surveys completed for genesis healthcare aco in 2017 ranged from only 21 to 65 surveys, representing .2% to . 7% of our attril: uted beneficiaries. furthermore, those sampled are entirely non-representative of our aco popu .ation that reside in the long-term care setting, and will not likely associate the care they received during their nursing facility stay with the primary care that is the subject of the survey. t.1e implications-of this inappropriate approach to garnering customer satisfaction with the delivery of primary care in our aco, especially the potential for extremely low results on the cahps survey, may in any performance year disqualify our aco from any shared savings altogether regardless of savings generated and achievement of quality performance on other measures. as c \\1s' s use of cahps is not mandated by statute or regulation - law and regulations are general ab c,ut what needs to be measured and do not dictate any specific survey tool - cms may implement a de minimis cut\u00e2\u00ad point so that cahps would only be required when a significant portion of the aco population is eligible to receive the survey, or excluded if only a nominal percentage ar,~ completed. in such situations, the associated points could be redistributed to the remaining quahty measures and the patient experience domain requirement would automatically be satisfied. the agency also could consider a substitution of a validated survey of nursing home resident~ which assesses similar issues of provider access and experience intended by the current sur v ey in lieu of the use of the cahps tool. de minimis standard for other quality measures similar to the concerns raised regarding cahps, other quality measures al:;o systematically exclude institutionalized patients. depression remission at 12 months (ac0-40) is one such measure. nursing home patients are excluded from the denominator. as a result, like cahps, this leads to miniscule sample sizes for acos like ours, resulting in a non- .\u00e2\u00b7epresentative and statistically meaningless result. a de minimis standard should be applied here as well. institutional population adjustment to utilization metrics hospital utilization for our population is more than three times that of the average aco population. the higher average incidence of all-cause unplanned admissions for patients with multiple chronic conditions (ac0-38) for institutional beneficiaries is nc,t accounted for in the determination of scoring for quality metrics, realistically putting achieverr ent for our population out ofreach and precluding our ability to achieve 100%. we recommend that quality metric performance be measured against benchmarks adjusted to reflect the weighted average of institutionalized vs community-based beneficiaries, using the respective 1ean performance rate, 30% and 90% percentile benchmarks for each subset population.\niii. required risk-taking \n page 6 mem,'jrandum providers will be at-risk for the first time; this may enable the placement of ap:jropriate risk protection contracts. we support the treatment of level e as an advanced apm to acknowledge th ;: assumption of risk and encourage greater participation at higher risk tracks. we recommend ~ emoval of restrictions preventing providers who begin at level e from moving up to the enhanced track without an interruption in their existing agreement or the redetermination ofb ;:nchmarks; rather, we would prefer that all levels of gainsharing and risk assumption be on a single platform to facilitate the continuous movement to higher thresholds. further, we would vrish to see the highest level include the ability to earn 100% of savings, particularly as the next gen program sunsets. as a skilled nursing facility operator, we work closely with upstream hospital and physician providers in many markets across the country to improve outcomes for shared patient populations. we are concerned about the implications on patient health and ajpropriate care delivery that may result from mandatory risk assumption for existing acos. even in the current environment, some acos and at-risk hospitals exert pressure on skilled nursing providers to discharge patients sooner than may be appropriate, drawing influence from their ability to direct referral volume. while we agree that real change occurs more readily in a ris~-based environment, we recommend that cms continue to move slowly, both by en1bling providers to proceed into risk at their own pace and by ensuring that adequate safeguards and patient protections are in place to support patient safety above all else. given difficulties we have experienced across multiple performance years related to issues outside of our control that have impacted the determination of our benchmarks, we are concerned about the imposition of early termination policies that penalize acos that do not generate savings. these proposed changes will harm patients and providers by limitir g the improvements in savings and quality acos achieve, potentially slowing progress in transit ioning to value-base payments.\niv. improvement in assignment methodology \n we support the added flexibility to enable acos to choose prospective or n!trospective assignment methodology annually regardless of risk level. we also support a hybrid approach to enable beneficiaries to either voluntarily align with an aco-participating p:1ysician or nurse practitioner of their choice or to opt-in to the aco directly, though we recommend voluntary or opt-in alignment be renewed within the first year following determination of institutional status as the majority of community-based providers do not follow patients into tl:.e long-term care setting. it was principally this lack in primary care coverage and timely and consistent access to medical providers that drove the creation of the genesis' physician servicei: organization and our\naco. the hybrid approach could be extended universally to all acos by default provided \n page 7 mem,'jrandum nurse practitioners (nps) and physician assistants (pas) for attribution consistent with cms regulations, nps and pas provide much of the care required by long-term care patients in many nursing homes. the role of the physician varies, with many physicians delegating their long-term care visits to them. for this reason, we recommend cms reconsider the requirement of one physician visit by an aco participant, particularly in this care setting, where the plurality of primary care by an np or pa should suffice. for the sane reason, we are supportive of voluntary alignment processes which permit attribution to an ni' or pa without requiring any additional aco physician visit. claims-based determination of place of service 31 and 32 we appreciate the proposed change in determination of place of service (po~,) using medicare claims for skilled nursing facility stays, though caution cms to accommodatf the longer claims runout period necessary as a result of post-acute billing practices before comrleting final aco beneficiary attribution, and would welcome transparency related to pos 31 and 32 claims-based attribution on quarterly cclfs as this information becomes available.\nv. assumption of downside risk upon exit \n given that the mssp is still a developing program in which significant adjustments that are unknowable to acos are made to benchmarks at annual settlements that are 1 ;ompleted far into the ensuing year providing limited time for planning and decision-making, w ~ oppose the more stringent requirements to assume greater risk for losses during a year of voluntary termination. voluntary termination should be understood by cms as a robson's

mssp. the agency would consolidate the number of mssp tracks down to two: basic and enhanced. under the basic track, eligible acos would begin under a one-sided model and incrementally phase-in risk over the course of a single agreement period. under the enhanced track, which is based on the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing track 3, acos would have the highest level of risk and potential reward. if cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal is finalized, acos would be restricted to a maximum of two years of upside-only risk, down from the current six years. ahs does not support the accelerated timeline for acos to transition to a two-sided risk model. we believe that the proposal does not take into account the reality of many providers. the journey towards accountable care is long, requiring organizations to fundamentally change their operations by adopting new legal structures, acquiring new staff, adopting new technologies and engaging in more robust data analytics. organizations need time to make these changes before taking on significant financial risk. providers must also address the opportunity costs associated with seeking to reduce inpatient admissions and shift care to lower paying sites of service. forcing providers into risk too quickly will likely result in many organizations withdrawing from the mssp. there is a learning curve associated with running an aco and organizations need an appropriate transition period that accounts for that time to learn. additionally, acos need time to realize their savings before taking additional financial risk. according to a survey from the national association of acos, organizations invest an average of $1.6 million annually to operate an aco.1 in two years, it is unlikely for an organization to have produced\n

beneficiary incentive programs that provide incentive payments to assigned beneficiaries who receive primary care services. an aco is prohibited from advertising a beneficiary incentive program. however, cms seeks comments on whether beneficiaries should be notified of the availability of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficiary incentive program via outreach materials approved by cms. additionally, cms seeks comments on how and when an aco should notify its beneficiaries of the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s availability. ahs recommends that cms provide a template for acos to notify beneficiaries about the beneficiary incentive program. this will give organizations complete certainty about the adequacy of the notification and address cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concern of acos \u00e2\u0080\u009cinappropriately steering beneficiaries to voluntarily align with the aco.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms should make available summary information about the use of the beneficiary incentive program when aco program results are released. this information will be useful to other acos as they consider implementation of the program. repayment for early termination cms proposes to adopt a new deadline, december 31st to june 30th, as the effective date of termination for acos to withdraw without liability for any portion of shared losses. cms also proposes to reduce the minimum notification period for acos that are voluntarily terminating participation from 60 to 30 days. this would allow acos to base their decision on three quarters of feedback reports, instead of two. ahs does not support the proposed termination date of june 30th for acos to avoid repayment losses. acos need sufficient time and appropriate fiscal data to ensure that the termination of an aco agreement is a sound business decision. acos should be able to terminate until at least 30 days after receipt of second quarter data without repaying losses. instituting a shorter termination deadline would leave acos with insufficient information to make termination decisions.\n election of minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss rate (mlr) by acos\n cms\u00e2\u0080\u00931701\u00e2\u0080\u0093p october 16,

cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 vision of moving health care from a fee-for-service environment to one focused on value-based care. however, to make this vision possible, the current regulatory framework must change. we need to help to hit the tipping point where value-based care is what we deliver. this will allow us to improve care coordination abilities and better serve our medicare beneficiaries. to build high performing networks, we must be able to assist physicians who are in solo or small practices make the investment in tools and technologies. to share technology enablement services with providers, we must overcome the barriers to interoperability. to develop common operation workflow, acos must be operationalized to enable physicians to focus on patient care, not on administration. and if we are to implement clinical pathways rooted in prevention, we must redesign our reimbursement system to reward providers for preventing disease, not just treating it. to achieve this, we must modernize the regulatory environment that currently slows providers down on their journey towards value-based health care delivery. if you have any questions or would like further information, please

administrator verma:\n established in 1943, the aaaai is a professional organization with more than 7,000 members in the united states, canada and 72 other countries. this membership includes allergist/immunologists (a/i), other medical specialists, allied health and related healthcare professionals\u00e2\u0080\u0094 all with a special interest in the research and treatment of patients with allergic and immunologic diseases. we appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback on proposals aimed at redesigning and providing a new direction for the medicare shared savings program (mssp) accountable care organizations (acos).\n allergy/immunology participation in acos in  its  march  report  to  the  congress,  the  medicare  payment  advisory commission  (medpac)  reported  that  sixty  percent  (60%)  of  aco- participating  physicians  are  specialists1,  however,  data  on  the  number and types of specialists engaging in acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including a/i practitioners \u00e2\u0080\u0093 remains difficult to obtain. and, despite this statistic, we are concerned that many acos are limiting the participation of and access to specialty care practitioners in this model.\n a/i  professionals  lead  in  the  diagnosis,  treatment  and  ongoing management of asthma, allergic and immunologic conditions. by itself, asthma \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a chronic disease involving the airways in the lungs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 affects more than 25 million americans at a total cost of $56 billion per year. asthma causes 14.2 million missed days of work and 10.5 million missed days  of  school,  and  results  in  479,300  hospitalizations,  1.9  million emergency department visits, and 8.9 million doctor visits.1\n (more)\n\n 2\n\n allergies are among the most common chronic conditions worldwide, with symptoms that range from an itchy  nose  up  to  anaphylaxis,  a  life-threatening  reaction.  allergic  rhinitis,  which  affects  17.6  million americans, can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (ait), also known as allergy shots. ait also is effective in asthma, where it has been shown to reduce symptoms, lower use of asthma medications, and improve  patient  quality of  life.  studies  have  also  shown  that  ait  is  highly  cost-effective  and  severely underutilized2.\n a/i professionals have expertise in a multitude of other key conditions and disease processes, including preventative and concurrent therapies that would significantly enhance diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management  for  key  conditions  generally  provided  by  other  medical  specialists. examples  include perioperative reactions; antibiotic allergies; metal allergies; adverse food reactions; aspirin sensitivity; chemotherapy hypersensitivity; acute and chronic sinus disease; and, primary immunodeficiency.\n as participants in a mssp aco, a/i professionals would enhance care quality and reduce resource use in these and other key areas. however, participating in acos remains a challenge. to that end, we urge cms to establish pathways for a/i professionals to meaningfully engage in the aco program, especially as the mssp aco program proliferates and as beneficiaries are able to opt-in. in addition, we urge cms to provide  mssp  acos  with  technical  assistance,  allowing  them  to  appropriately  analyze  clinical  and administrative data, thus improving their understanding of the contributions a/i professionals could make in addressing the complex health needs of their assigned population, including those described above. finally, as the agency continues to implement the qpp, we ask that cms publicly release data on the participation rates of a/i professionals in acos.\n access to a/i professionals beneficiary access to specialty medical care is monitored by cms through survey data collected from beneficiaries via the \u00e2\u0080\u009caccess to specialists\u00e2\u0080\u009d module of the cg-cahps survey. we are concerned, however, that the measure is not enough to demonstrate whether beneficiaries are being referred to a specialist, such as an a/i professional, at the appropriate point of intervention. given many beneficiaries may be unaware that a/i intervention is necessary for proper diagnosis and treatment, the survey data could be unreliable.  we urge cms to closely examine the referral patterns of acos and establish benchmarks that will foster an appropriate level of access to and care coordination with a/i professionals, in addition to collecting feedback from beneficiaries on access to a/i professionals.\n emphasizing use of clinical data registries acos  are  only  required  to  report  on  a  limited  set  of  primary-care  focused,  population-based  quality measures, most of which do not address conditions treated by a/i professionals. aaaai has developed the only a/i specific clinical data registry, which is recognized by cms as a qualified clinical data registry (qcdr)  under  programs  established  by  the  medicare  access  and  chip  reauthorization  act  of  2015 (macra). to  encourage  acos  to  include  more  specialists  in  their models  and to ensure more  robust reporting of meaningful specialty-focused quality measures, we encourage cms to emphasize clinical data registry reporting by aco participants. specifically, cms should develop an aco-reported measure that captures the volume of aco participants participating in specialty-focused clinical data registries, such as the aaaai qcdr.\n\n 3\n *****\n we

of medicare beneficiaries, lower the growth rate of healthcare spending and improve quality in the medicare program.\n naacos is the largest association of acos, representing more than 6 million beneficiary lives through 370 mssp, next generation, and commercial acos. naacos is an aco member-led and member-owned non- profit organization that works on behalf of acos across the nation to improve the quality of medicare, population health and outcomes, and healthcare cost efficiency. our members, more than many other healthcare organizations, want to see an effective, coordinated patient-centric care process.\n the aco model is a market-based solution to fragmented and costly care that empowers local physicians, hospitals and other providers to work together and take responsibility for improving quality, enhancing patient experience and reducing waste. importantly, the aco model also maintains patient choice of clinicians and other providers. while the origins of medicare acos date back to the george w. bush administration, the mssp has grown considerably in recent years and now includes 561 acos, covering\n10.5 million beneficiaries. acos have been instrumental in the shift to value-based care and a central part \n of the aco concept is to transform healthcare through meaningful clinical and operational changes to put patients first by improving their care and reducing unnecessary expenditures.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n this fall naacos conducted a poll of to collect feedback in response the pathways to success rule to solicit input about the rule to help inform our comments. the survey, conducted by naacos through a web-based questionnaire sent to all mssp acos, drew 153 responses from 127 unique acos, representing 23 percent of mssp acos. naacos released a report on the findings from the poll, which is available here. there are a number of notable results detailed in the report which we hope cms will consider as it evaluates comments. for example, when asked about their aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall level of support for the proposed rule, 27 percent of respondents report favoring the rule while more than 60 percent report opposing the proposed rule.\n the levels of support and opposition were informed by what aco respondents identified as the top opportunities and challenges in the proposed rule. specifically, 57 percent of respondents reported concern with cutting shared savings rates for many acos from 50 percent to as low as 25 percent; 51 percent reported concern with designating acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009clow\u00e2\u0080\u009d revenue and requiring more risk sooner for \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue acos\u00e2\u0080\u009d; 43 percent reported concern with shortening the time for shared savings-only acos from six years to two years; and 31 percent reported concern with capping risk adjustment at +/- 3 percent across five-year agreement periods. while risk adjustment proposals were identified as a challenge, they were also identified as an opportunity. importantly, sixty percent of acos reported that if finalized, they would have been unlikely to have entered the mssp as new acos under revised policies laid out in a proposed rule.\n in contrast, acos expressed support for a number of proposals in the rule and the top three opportunities were clear with the first, selected by over 55 percent of respondents, being the ability to choose an assignment methodology annually, regardless of mssp track or level. aco respondents noted their support for proposed changes that would expand use of payment waivers and beneficiary incentives with 42 percent of respondents selecting the expanded use of these waivers and introduction of the beneficiary incentive program as a leading opportunity proposed in the rule. citing a desire for increased program stability and predictability, slightly more than 30 percent of respondents chose the proposed shift from three-year to five-year agreements as the third most popular opportunity included in the rule.\n\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n summary of key recommendations as detailed in the comments below, in the final pathways to success rule we urge the agency to: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 restructure the mssp with the proposed basic and

not cut in half the shared savings rates for shared savings-only acos and to apply the following shared savings rates: 50 percent for basic levels a and b, 55 percent for basic levels c and d, and 60 percent for basic level e \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 not to finalize the arbitrary distinction of high and low revenue acos. we oppose requirements that high revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or any acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 not require any acos to participate in the enhanced track but keep that a voluntary model for acos prepared for higher levels of risk and reward \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 update the risk adjustment methodology by allowing risk scores to change by +/-5 percent over an agreement, as opposed to the proposed +/-3 percent range, and to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 finalize policies that support the move to regional benchmarking, including maintaining the current maximum of 70 percent regional expenditures, and remove aco beneficiaries from the regional population \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 not finalize the proposal to permit cms to terminate an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement if expenditures exceed a certain amount after two performance periods \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 not finalize the proposal to establish a june 30 deadline to voluntarily terminate aco participation agreements \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 create a policy allowing acos with agreements expiring in 2018 the option of extending their current participation agreements from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 not move forward with the proposed beneficiary opt-in assignment methodology and instead improve upon the current voluntary

\u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to introduce a glidepath to higher risk between basic level e and the enhanced track and to not require participation in the enhanced track but provide it as a voluntary option for acos ready for higher levels of risk and reward.\n proposals: cms proposes that effective june 30, 2019 the agency would retire the current mssp tracks 1, 1+, 2 and 3 and would replace those with new basic (including levels a through e) and enhanced tracks effective with a transition to the new tracks beginning july 1, 2019. while there are a number of overall program changes, the new tracks and levels have overall similarities to most of the existing tracks, such that they are roughly equivalent as follows:\n current mssp track equivalent under proposed mssp structure track 1 basic level a and b track 1+ basic level e track 2 no equivalent track 3 enhanced track\n comments:\n renaming and restructuring the mssp\n we support the transition to the new basic and enhanced tracks, especially with the introduction of a more gradual glidepath to assuming risk in the basic track. this allows acos to gain exposure to risk in a more incremental manner than what is currently available in the mssp. we strongly support the permanent inclusion of the track 1+ equivalent, basic level e, which is an important option for acos assuming downside financial risk and allows loss sharing limits similar to those required for advanced alternative payment models (apms) in the quality payment program (qpp). that said, we have a number of concerns with the specific shared savings and loss rates included in the revised mssp, which are discussed in detail in later sections of this comment letter. the basic and enhanced track labels are more descriptive than the current labels for the existing mssp tracks. we recommend that should these name changes be finalized, that they stay in place moving forward to ensure continuity and understanding across the industry.\n moving from level e to the enhanced track\n while we are pleased with the more gradual glidepath to risk in the basic track, there remains a significant jump from basic level e to the enhanced track. in 2018, fewer than 7 percent of mssp acos elected to participate in track 3, the equivalent of the enhanced track. introduced in 2016, track 3 was meant to provide a more advanced option for acos ready for higher levels of risk and reward, but only a very small group of acos have chosen to participate. while the proposed rule provides some changes to the enhanced track, which also apply to other downside financial risk models in the basic track, there remains a massive jump in risk from basic level e and the enhanced track, with the latter requiring maximum losses based on total cost of care and capped at almost four times those in the basic level e. cms acknowledges this significant increase and requests feedback, stating on page 41818:\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n time limitation on participation in the basic track, acos may not prepare to take on the highest level of risk that could drive the most meaningful change in providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099/suppliers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior toward achieving the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n establishing an aco and embarking on the related transformations inherent in population health are what drives changes in provider behavior. these changes often take years to generate results, as evidenced by the increasingly positive results for acos that are in the program for a longer period of time. we point to august 2017 findings from the department of health and human services inspector general (oig) and 2017 mssp results available in the public use file as proof that acos need time to generate positive results and demonstrate change. therefore, we have concerns with the assertion that high levels of risk are the key driver with changing provider/supplier behavior which would help achieve the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals. as harvard medical school researchers j. michael mcwilliams et al noted in their report, medicare spending after 3 years of the medicare shared savings program, published in the new england journal of medicine (nejm) on sept. 20, contracts with no downside risk contracts, which appeal to smaller organizations, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaybe effective in lowering medicare spending.\u00e2\u0080\u009d we urge the agency to focus on incentivizing the care transformations tied to population health and value-based care rather than focus on requiring risk as the sole mechanism to change provider behavior.\n the significant increase in the enhanced track risk level is based on an increased shared loss rate and a much higher benchmark-based loss sharing limit. the downside financial risk models in the basic track include lower shared loss rates and a revenue-based loss sharing limit, which caps risk based on provider revenue rather than total cost of care, which is the basis for the benchmark-based loss sharing limit. the enhanced track does not include a revenue-based loss sharing limit, and we urge the agency to create one and to create more options for gradual risk increases between basic level e and the enhanced track. it is also essential that cms revise its policies to keep the enhanced track voluntary, as with track 3, and not attempt to push acos into a model with levels of risk they are unprepared to assume. requiring acos to potentially pay millions of dollars to medicare is simply not practical or feasible for most of these organizations.\n it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to recognize that acos that are not ready for such high levels of risk under the enhanced track will not move forward; they will quit the program altogether. as mcwilliams and his colleagues noted in the nejm-published research, mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benefits \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould erode if policy changes, such as requiring acos to assume downside risk after fewer years of participation, cause acos to leave the program.\u00e2\u0080\u009d using a government mandate to assume high levels of provider risk is not the solution to increasing aco participation and achieving successful results for acos. the unintended consequences of forcing high levels of risk will significantly undermine the mssp and result in diverting valuable investments in care coordination away from medicare patients and towards other patients under value- based contracts. further, the disproportionate emphasis on reducing costs often overshadows the equally important goal of quality improvement that the aco model offers, which benefits patients and the medicare program generally. while some acos have not yet been able to experience a return on the investments they have made, they have generated savings to the government while improving patient care, which studies show has a positive downstream impact on spending, but may take years to fully materialize. for example, mssp acos generated gross savings of $1.1 billion for py 2017 based on the cms methodology for setting financial benchmarks. sixty percent of acos saved medicare money in 2017 with 34 percent of acos earning shared savings and 26 percent of acos generating savings for medicare but not enough savings meet the threshold (i.e., the minimum savings rate (msr)) needed to earn shared-savings payments. these acos are on the right path, and we urge cms to support them so they continue to generate savings for medicare and positive quality for beneficiaries. success does not equal assuming risk. we urge cms to allow all acos to remain indefinitely in basic level e without being forced to move to the enhanced track.\n\n 601 13th

agreement periods from three years to five years, which will promote program stability. extended agreement periods allow acos a longer horizon on which to plan and to benefit from efficiency gains before benchmark rebasing. many acos have expressed the desire to have more program stability and predictability and shifting to longer agreement periods will enable that. we urge cms to finalize this change as proposed. we also support the proposal to modify current restrictions that prevent an aco from terminating its participation agreement and re-entering the program before the existing agreement period would have ended. this \u00e2\u0080\u009csit out\u00e2\u0080\u009d period is unnecessary and shuts providers out of participating in an essential cms value-based program. eliminating this restriction will allow the flexibility for an aco in an agreement period to terminate its participation agreement and then enter a new five-year agreement period under one of the redesigned participation options proposed in this rule. we recommend cms finalize this as proposed.\n timeframe to transition to risk\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to finalize a policy allowing all new acos entering the program to remain in basic track level a for two years and basic track level b for an additional two years before requiring the aco to move to level c in the fifth and final year of their agreement. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos also asks cms to allow acos meeting certain performance criteria to participate for a third year in basic track level b, providing acos that demonstrate superior performance with up to five years in basic track levels a and b.\n proposals: cms proposes acos would progress from shared savings-only to risk-based models under timeframes that apply to acos differently depending largely on previous program experience and aco type (high vs. low revenue). levels a and b of the basic track would be shared savings-only models, and after two years, acos would gradually assume more risk over time as they progress along basic track levels c through e. cms proposes to automatically advance acos over time across the levels and allow acos to elect annually to move up to higher risk levels in the basic track more quickly than what is required. the new proposed structure includes a more gradual glide path for assuming risk between basic track levels a through level e. however, there remains a significant jump in the risk level required when moving from basic level e (losses capped at 4 percent of the benchmark) to the enhanced track (losses capped at 15 percent of the benchmark).\n cms proposes acos would not be permitted to switch from the basic track to the enhanced track during their five- year agreement period. however, because cms proposes to eliminate the current restriction that prevents acos that terminate during an agreement from re-entering the program before the contract would have ended, an aco could terminate its contract and quickly move to the enhanced track under a new agreement.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895

evidence that acos save more money \n for medicare than what is reflected in basic evaluations of performance compared to cms benchmarks.\n acos have also demonstrated impressive quality results. a 2017 oig report, medicare program shared savings acos have shown potential for reducing spending and improving quality, found that acos achieved high quality and in particular noted progress on important measures including reduced hospital readmissions and screening beneficiaries for risk of falling and depression. recently released mssp performance year 2017 data shows a mean quality score of 90.5 percent out of 100 percent for acos subject to pay-for-performance measures. further, analysis of mssp performance year 2016 results shows that acos improve quality over time, with average performance improving 15 percent across 25 measures used consecutively across program years. evidence clearly shows that acos improve over time in the program and that shared savings-only models generate savings to cms and improve quality of care for the patients they serve. therefore, it is critical that cms allow acos to remain in shared savings-only models (basic track levels a and b) for more than the proposed two years.\n if finalized, there will be a detrimental effect on new applicants and participation in the aco program will be diminished. we request that cms modify proposals for all acos (including both high- and low-revenue acos) to allow more time to participate in shared savings-only models. specifically, naacos urges cms to finalize a policy allowing all new acos to remain in basic track level a for two years and basic track level b for an additional two years before requiring the aco to move to level c in the fifth and final year of their agreement. these acos should then be permitted to begin their second agreement period at basic track level d where they would participate for three years and progress to level e for the final two years of their second agreement period (with options to progress more quickly if the aco chooses). this would provide acos with four years of participation in shared savings-only models and a fifth year for those that demonstrate exceptional performance, as described below. providing acos with four years in shared savings-only models provides the aco with only two to three years of performance data, the minimum that would be necessary to identify trends and opportunities for transformation and improvement.\n naacos strongly believes acos who meet superior performance criteria should also be permitted to participate for a third year in basic track level b, allowing high performing acos to remain in a shared savings only model for a full five-year agreement period in cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed basic track. specifically, based on evaluation of the previous three performance years, we urge cms to allow acos that meet at least one of the criteria below to have a third year in basic track level b, giving the aco a full five-year agreement period in a shared savings only model:\n\n1. acos that generate net savings across three performance years: acos have demonstrated an increasing \n likelihood of achieving shared savings over time. this is likely the result of a combination of factors, such as their experience, realization of long-term commitments and investments in priorities such as care coordination, quality improvement, and data analytics. this trend is promising and means more savings over time for the medicare trust fund. however, many acos generate savings, as defined by having expenditures lower than their benchmark, but do not surpass their msr and thus do not qualify for earned shared savings. the msr in track 1 can be as high as 3.9 percent, which is a considerable hurdle. while these acos may not earn shared savings, they are saving medicare money and delivering high quality care. cms has no reason to discourage their continued participation. therefore, we urge cms to allow acos that generate net savings relative to their benchmark across three performance years (including those that do not surpass their msr) to have the option of continuing in basic track level b for a third year following their participation in basic track level a for two years.\n\n2. acos that score at or above the 50th percentile in quality in one of two performance years: acos that \n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n continuing in basic track level b for a third year following their participation in basic track level a for two years.\n\n3. acos that improve their overall quality score by 10 percentage points or greater over the course of \n performance years: acos that demonstrate a significant improvement in their quality score have made a clear investment in quality and have had a positive impact on the medicare beneficiaries. these acos should be rewarded for these efforts and provided additional time to give their investments in quality an opportunity to materialize into cost savings, rather than being prematurely forced into a two-sided risk track. therefore, we urge cms to allow acos that improve their overall quality score by 10 percentage points over the course of the two performance years the option of continuing in basic track level b for a third year following their participation in basic track level a for two years.\n adopting these changes would provide acos with the time they need to transform health care through meaningful clinical and operational changes to put patients first by improving their care and reducing unnecessary expenditures. these transformations are significant and, as such, require time for implementation and to produce measurable results. acos are investing millions of dollars of their own capital to make these care improvements, even though medicare does not recognize these start-up and ongoing investments in its calculations of aco savings, losses, and costs. further, the benefits of these transformations extend beyond the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed medicare fee-for-service patient population and have a broader effect on medicare advantage beneficiaries and even patient populations beyond medicare. finalizing cms proposals to drastically reduce the amount of time available to acos in shared savings-only models will minimize the positive impact acos have on their communities. it is critical that cms provide acos with additional time in shared savings-only models to allow for a successful transition from fee-for-service to value-based care.\n shared savings and loss rates, loss sharing limits\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms not to cut in half the shared savings rates for shared savings only acos and to apply the following shared savings rates: 50 percent for basic levels a and b, 55 percent for basic levels c and d, and 60 percent for basic level e. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos strongly recommends that cms emphasize and reward above average quality performance or improvement by providing additional shared savings on a sliding scale up to 10 percentage points. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges the agency to lower the benchmark-based level e loss sharing limit to equal macra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally applicable nominal amount standard of 3 percent.\n proposals: as shown in table a, cms proposes a number of changes to the shared savings rates for basic levels a through d, as compared to the current 50 percent shared savings rate for track 1. specifically, under the proposed one-sided model, a final sharing rate would not exceed 25 percent based on quality performance and would apply to first dollar shared savings for acos that meet or exceed their msr.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895

shared savings rates\n naacos strongly opposes major reductions in shared savings rates from the current track 1 shared savings rate of 50 percent to as low as 25 percent under the proposed basic track levels a and b. this severe reduction in shared savings would drastically halt new acos from entering the program. since the release of the proposed rule, many acos have expressed concern about these reductions and stated they would not have entered the program as new acos with these inadequate proposed shared savings rates. as noted in a comment letter to this cms proposal from researchers at harvard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshared savings rates have been low in the mssp, allowing acos in track 1 to keep no more than 50 percent of the difference between its expenditures and its benchmark. because imperfect quality scores reduce the shared savings rate, it has been even lower, averaging 44.2 percent in 2014 and 47.8 percent in 2017.\u00e2\u0080\u009d therefore, in addition to the meager proposed shared savings rates for levels a through d of the basic track, it is important to note that these shared savings rates would likely be even lower than what is proposed when cms reduces them for imperfect quality performance. naacos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 members report spending almost $2 million a year on average for mssp participation, including investments made in health information technology, population health management and aco administration. such a drastic reduction in shared savings payments will not allow acos to recoup those investments and deter future participation in such a needed value-based payment program like mssp.\n the shared savings rates have been debated numerous times with many calls to increase shared savings rates above the current 50 percent in track 1 and 1+. for example, as shown in the excerpt below from page 67929 of the november 2011 mssp final rule which initially set the mssp shared savings rates, many commenters including medpac called for much higher shared savings rates, such as 75 percent, to incentivize aco participation.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommenters suggested sharing rates ranging from 50 to 95 percent (most commonly 75 percent) under the one-sided model and 66 to 95 percent (most commonly 80 percent) under the two-sided model. medpac recommended increasing the sharing rates for both models, suggesting, for example, offering a savings rate of up to 75 percent for the one-sided model and 95 percent for the two-sided model for the first agreement period.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n benchmarks. these savings are sure to grow over more recent years as more acos participate in mssp and gain the experience needed to produce positive results.\n there have been some public comments from cms leaders that acos in shared savings-only models do not generate savings. however, recent cms data on py 2017 mssp results, available in this public use file, shows this claim is not true. acos in shared savings-only models and those with downside financial risk both had net positive savings in 2017. in fact, as shown in table 4, the savings per beneficiary was higher for acos in track 1. further, one would expect the savings to be higher for acos in models with downside financial risk as to date, acos have self- selected to move to a risk-based model, which is typically the result of being successful in the shared savings- only model.\n table 4: net savings for acos based on track track net savings to medicare (millions)* means savings per beneficiary percent acos generating savings track 1 $290 $138 33% track 2/3 $23 $55 51% *net savings factors in bonuses paid to acos\n rather than make shared savings-only models less appealing, we urge cms to focus its efforts on making models with downside financial risk more attractive while continuing to support shared savings-only models. it is essential that cms structure the program such that it includes a business model attractive enough to retain current participants while bringing in new acos to create a pipeline for acos to advance on the path to value-based care. the proposed shared savings rates will fall short of that goal. therefore, we urge cms to maintain a 50 percent shared savings rate for basic levels a and b and to apply a 55 percent shared savings rate for levels c and d and a 60 percent shared savings rate for level e.\n further, we request cms adjust shared savings rates based on quality, which is a primary goal of the aco program. unfortunately, acos that achieve high-quality performance are not rewarded through increased shared savings or higher benchmarks. in contrast, medicare advantage (ma) plans are rewarded with higher benchmarks for higher quality, which puts acos at a disadvantage. as medpac noted in its feb. 2, 2015 letter to cms, \"otherwise, the aco with top quality performance would end up with a lower benchmark than an ma plan in the same market with top quality performance. that situation could be seen as inequitable for the aco.\"\n efforts to improve quality consume aco resources and increase spending relative to financial benchmarks in the short term, even if these efforts decrease medicare spending over the long term. for example, an aco that does extensive patient outreach for cancer screening, such as colonoscopies, could expend considerable resources delivering these services, which may prevent the need for expensive late-stage cancer treatments for the screened patients. acos that make large investments to improve quality performance may be less able to keep spending below their benchmarks as a direct result of their increased investment in quality. we urge cms to use a similar approach for ma and mssp by properly rewarding acos for high quality. it is important to recognize high-quality performance compared to established measure thresholds as well as to recognize \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and reward \u00e2\u0080\u0093 quality improvement relative to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous performance. therefore, to emphasize and reward above average quality performance or improvement, we urge cms to provide on a sliding scale up to 10 percentage points of additional shared savings.\n shared loss rates\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n at 20 percent and 25 percent respectively. this supports a gradual ramp up of assuming risk under an asymmetric approach.\n loss sharing limits\n cms notes the proposed approach for determining loss sharing limits would tend to place acos that include hospitals under a benchmark-based loss sharing limit because the participants of these acos typically have higher total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue compared to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark. we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to apply a loss sharing limit that is the lesser of the revenue-based or benchmark-based threshold. this allows flexibility for acos and does not place them in a particular category as a result of their aco participant composition. we recommend cms finalize this as proposed.\n we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to set the loss sharing limits for level e so those acos continue to qualify for advanced apm bonuses under the qpp established by the 2015 medicare access and chip reauthorization act (macra). however, we urge the agency to lower the benchmark-based level e loss sharing limit to equal the macra generally applicable nominal amount standard, rather than setting it one percent higher, as proposed. this would result in a level e benchmark-based loss sharing limit of 3 percent for 2019, which reflects the level of risk cms considers sufficient for macra advanced apms. this represents a more gradual increase in risk and aligns with the approach used for the revenue-based loss sharing limit, which is proposed to be set equal to, not higher than, the macra generally applicable nominal amount standard.\n cms explains that the agency would determine an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loss sharing limit annually at the time of financial reconciliation. while the agency notes this is consistent with its current process for track 2 and 3 acos, the timing of this determination is troubling. financial reconciliation occurs months after the close of the performance year, meaning acos would face uncertainly about their maximum potential losses until after the performance year is over. one of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals with the proposed rule is to promote predictability and stability, a goal shared by naacos. however, not knowing the maximum amount of losses an acos may face creates significant uncertainty that undermines cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on improved predictability and stability. participation in mssp tracks 2 and 3 remains low, and the uncertainty about potential losses is one of the reasons that has prevented more acos from joining these downside financial risk models. we urge cms to learn from this lesson and provide the loss sharing limit determination prior to or at the start of the performance year rather than at the time of financial reconciliation.\n high revenue and low revenue aco designations\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms not to finalize the arbitrary distinction of high and low revenue acos and opposes requirements that high-revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or any acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms not to require any acos to participate in the enhanced track but to keep that a voluntary model for acos prepared for higher levels of risk and reward. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos recommends cms reinstate advanced funding opportunities to help acos assume risk.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n ownership or operational interests but would focus on participant revenue compared to benchmarks. the proposed definitions of high revenue and low revenue acos are as follows:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 high revenue aco means an aco whose total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue of its aco participants is at least 25 percent of the total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 low revenue aco means an aco whose total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue of its aco participants is less than 25 percent of the total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries\n the total aco revenue of participants would be based on revenue for the most recent calendar year for which 12 months of data are available, as would the total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries. cms notes that that low revenue acos tend to be smaller, physician-led, and rural acos, which the agency explains are less likely to have access to capital to assume risk. therefore, cms considers but does not propose benefits to low revenue acos, such as providing them with a lower msr in levels a and b (1 or 2 percent) or using a higher shared savings rates such as 50 percent for levels a through d. cms notes that hospital- or health system-based acos will typically be considered high revenue acos, but hospital-based acos with relatively low aco participant ffs revenue compared to their benchmark would be low revenue acos.\n comments: in the proposed rule, cms states its belief that acos whose participants have greater total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue relative to their benchmarks have more ability to control costs and may be better financially prepared to move to greater levels of risk. accordingly, the agency notes that its comparison of revenue to benchmark would provide a more accurate method for determining an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preparedness to take on additional risk rather than an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-reported information regarding the composition of its aco participants and any ownership and operational interests in those aco participants. we do not support the current self-reporting requirements for track 1+ that result in acos falling under the revenue- or benchmark-based track 1+ loss sharing limits. we have previously urged cms to provide track 1+ acos flexibility to select either a revenue- or benchmark-based loss sharing limit, and we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to apply the lesser of the revenue- or benchmark-based loss sharing limit for basic level e.\n while we appreciate removing the self-reporting requirements under track 1+, we question the need to further divide acos into arbitrary categories of high and low revenue acos and to apply different schedules for how and when they must progress along the risk continuum. the proposed 25 percent threshold appears arbitrary and creates division where none should exist. we oppose categorizing acos in this manner and urge cms to not finalize the high and low revenue distinctions. all acos should be on the same path to assuming risk as recommended in this letter, which should include a gradual ramp up of risk, sufficient shared savings rates, and the ability to participate indefinitely in basic level e without having to move to the enhanced track.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n\n the proposed high and low revenue distinctions create unnecessary program complexity, which cms has taken great strides to try to reduce across a variety of medicare programs in recent months. furthermore, the move creates uncertainty for acos who may have a difficult time predicting the category in which they would fall. this distinction would also change over time as aco participant composition changes, adding more complexity and making long-term planning very difficult. this uncertainty would be further compounded by the timing of the cms high/low revenue determination, which the agency explains would not occur until after the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application is submitted. should cms move forward with a high/low revenue distinction, we urge cms provide the final determination as early as possible in the application process, baring notable participant changes during the process which would change the determination. given the significance of this determination, acos must know in advance into which category they would fall.\n while we appreciate the gradual ramp up of risk in the basic track, the overall restructuring of the mssp has considerably more complexity with cms evaluating whether acos are new, renewing or re-entering, experienced or inexperienced with performance-based risk, high or low revenue, etc. eliminating the high/low revenue distinction would help minimize some of the complexity and would remove a significant amount of work required by cms and acos to model, predict, and determine if the aco would be high or low revenue.\n the administration has made comments about supporting market solutions and level playing fields among competitors. we appreciate that perspective and respectfully point out that this proposed policy is contrary to a market-based approach whereby all competitors have similar opportunities for success. rather than finalize unnecessary and arbitrary distinctions for acos, cms should work to support all acos as they progress on the value- based care continuum, and the agency should create meaningful incentives for acos to assume risk. the goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients, and cms should adopt policies that continue to engage hospitals as key players rather than create incentives to exclude hospitals as aco participants. the best way to drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate to innovate and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare. medpac addressed this in its june 2018 report noting, while hospitals may have certain conflicting interests that create challenges for aco participation, hospitals should continue to be part of acos.\n the administration has also noted concerns that acos are a potential driver of consolidation in the healthcare industry. there are no studies or data supporting this claim, which is a flawed assumption. reduced payment rates, increased regulatory burdens and requirements to assume risk are actual drivers of consolidation, and organizations often consolidate to more efficiently manage these challenges. further, acos do not drive physician employment and many effective acos engage a majority of independent clinicians. acos support greater clinical integration and collaboration among doctors, hospitals and other care providers and align the payment system to incent coordination and cost savings across these silos. this alignment accomplishes what the model is designed to do, and what providers need out of high-value networks, without necessitating consolidation and direct employment of physicians. in fact, these opportunities to collaborate often help providers avoid consolidation. the greatest fear related to consolidation is its potential to lead to higher prices. ultimately, one of the best ways to protect against escalating costs is to advance alternative payment models that hold providers accountable and rewards them for improving care and reducing costs for an entire population.\n in addition to our recommendations not to finalize the distinction between high and low revenue acos, we recommend that cms support acos by reinstating advanced funding opportunities to enable acos to assume risk. the agency previously offered programs to help fund acos up front, with those payments later recouped via shared savings. these programs, such as the aco investment model (aim) or similar ones, should be reinstated to help acos fund activities and transformations early on in acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 development.\n\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac

allow acos in downside financial risk models to select a symmetrical msr/minimum loss rate (mlr) but requests acos be able to update this selection during an agreement period. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to lower the msr for shared savings-only models to be set between 2.0 and 2.5 percent.\n proposals: in order to qualify for a shared savings payment, or to be responsible for sharing losses with cms, an aco's average per capita medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for its assigned beneficiary population for the performance year must be below or above the updated benchmark, respectively, by at least the msr/mlr. for acos under basic track levels a and b, cms proposes to use the same sliding scale for the msr that is currently used for track 1, which is based on the number of beneficiaries assigned to the aco to establish the msr.\n prior to entering a model with downside financial risk (basic levels c, d, e or the enhanced track), cms proposes to continue to have an aco select a symmetrical msr/mlr. this selection would be made as part of the application cycle prior to entering a model with downside financial risk and the selection would apply for the duration of the applicable agreement period. the aco would be able to choose from the following options, consistent with current policy: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 0 percent msr/mlr \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 symmetrical msr/mlr in a 0.5 percent increment between 0.5 and 2.0 percent \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 symmetrical msr/mlr that varies based on the number of beneficiaries assigned to the aco\n the variable msr/mlr would be determined based on the number of assigned beneficiaries as is currently used for two-sided model acos that have selected the variable option. cms also proposes to use a variable msr/mlr when performing shared savings and shared losses calculations if an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population falls below 5,000 for the performance year, regardless of whether the aco selected a fixed or variable msr/mlr.\n comments: we support allowing acos in models with downside financial risk to continue to have choices with selecting a symmetrical msr/mlr and request cms finalize this proposal. this flexibility is important for acos who may want to set an msr/mlr higher or lower depending on how conservative or aggressive their goals are for earning savings and having to repay losses. given the extended five-year agreement periods cms proposes, we urge the agency to allow acos to change their msr/mlr at the start of a performance year rather than be locked into that decision for up to five years of an agreement period.\n while the secretary has a statutory requirement to determine as msr based upon the number of medicare ffs beneficiaries assigned to an aco, there is no specific statutory requirement for msrs to rise as high as 3.9 percent for smaller acos. this creates a significant hurdle for smaller and rural acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 groups of providers cms has vowed to help \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to earn savings and thus a disincentive to join the mssp. we urge cms to use its authority to lower that threshold and revise the msr schedule for acos based on beneficiary population size such that the cap on msrs for smaller acos is 2.5 percent, and to meet statutory requirements, for larger acos would be set as low as 2 percent.\n early termination

cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to establish a june 30 deadline to voluntarily terminate aco participation agreements. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to provide acos with the ability to engage with high performing providers by allowing acos to select their participants by national provider identifier (npi) rather than solely at the tax identification number (tin) level.\n proposals: beginning on january 1, 2019, cms proposes to monitor whether an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expenditures for assigned beneficiaries population are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning that the expenditures exceed either the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative msr under a one-sided model or the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mlr under a two-sided model. if the aco is negative outside corridor for one performance year, cms proposes the agency may take pre-termination actions, including requiring a corrective action plan. if the aco is negative outside corridor for another performance year, cms proposes the agency may immediately or with advance notice terminate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement. cms also seeks comment on whether acos should be permitted to obtain reinsurance. cms proposes to reduce the minimum notification period from 60 to 30 days for early termination. this would allow acos considering a year-end termination to have three quarters of feedback reports, instead of two. for acos that voluntarily terminate after the june 30 deadline, cms proposes to pro-rate the shared-loss amount by the number of months during the year in which the aco was a participant in the program. cms also proposes to pro-rate shared losses for acos in two-sided models that are involuntarily terminated by cms. to calculate the prorated share of losses, cms will multiply the amount of shared losses calculated for the performance year by the quotient equal to the number of months of participation in the program during the performance year, including the month in which the termination was effective, divided by 12. cms also proposes special rules for acos that participate for a portion of a six-month performance year during 2019 (january 1, 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093june 30, 2019 or july 1, 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0093december 31, 2019):\n\n1. if the aco terminates its participation agreement effective

option to participate for the first six months of the year prior to terminating their current agreement and entering a new agreement period beginning july 1, 2019. cms proposes these acos would be eligible for prorated shared savings or losses for the six-month period from january 1, 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 june 30, 2019.\n comments: naacos has deep concerns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal

model after two performance years. cms notes the provision is intended to remove so-called bad actors from the program, however, naacos asserts this policy instead will have the unintended consequence of removing well intentioned acos from the program who might otherwise go on to achieve savings and make quality improvements for their patients.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington,

should not cause the aco to be deemed a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad actor\u00e2\u0080\u009d or penalized by being terminated from the program. while we support addressing valid program integrity concerns, we urge cms not to consider slightly elevated spending as evidence of fraud, waste and abuse.\n further, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside the corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d sets a very low bar, especially for acos in downside financial risk models where the aco can select an mlr as low as 0 percent. many acos view selection of the msr/mlr in a two-sided model as a significant incentive to move into a model with downside financial risk, but this proposal would create a double edge sword whereby an aco that wants to take on greater accountability through a lower mlr would be faced with potentially being kicked out of the program as a result of spending that exceeds their mlr. this proposal also does not make sense in the context of acos assuming risk, whereby once they meet or exceed their mlr they must pay back a portion of losses to medicare. requiring these acos to repay losses protects the medicare trust fund, and it is unnecessary at the same time to implement program policies aimed at removing acos from the program for having higher than expected spending.\n should the agency move forward with this type of early termination policy, at a minimum it should be used only in rare cases where the agency specifically has documented program integrity concerns. alternatively, naacos encourages cms to better serve beneficiaries and american taxpayers by creating a direct channel for acos to report suspected fraud and abuse. value-based delivery models such as acos have a unique vantage point and the properly aligned incentives to identify and ultimately report fraud. on average, a medicare aco is assigned 17,000 lives and includes hundreds of clinicians. its success depends on an aco continuously monitoring its expenditures. because acos are held responsible for the total cost of care for their assigned beneficiaries, acos are also monitoring services rendered by clinicians outside the aco and keep an eye on reimbursements completely removed from their own financial interests other than to achieve shared savings. that close attention to beneficiaries and the services they are accessing through medicare provides acos a frontline perspective to identify and report suspicious activity, yet acos have no direct access to cms program integrity. making this change would better support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stated fraud and abuse goals.\n should cms finalize its proposal to retain the right to terminate an aco whose expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the agency must use a more appropriate standard to identify acos who would be subject to such a policy. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed approach would monitor specifically for whether the expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries exceed the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark by an amount equal to or exceeding either the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative msr under a one-sided model or the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mlr under a two-sided model. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed policy would have identified 82 acos in 2017 under these proposed criteria. of the 142 acos that earned shared savings payments for 2017 performance and had program experience prior to 2017, 36 percent had losses (i.e., expenditures higher than benchmarks) in one of their first two years of the program. such a policy would have removed these acos from the program prematurely, before they were able to go on and demonstrate success. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed policy is far too broad and contrary to the stated intent of the proposal to identify \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad actors\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the program.\n cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed approach is overreaching and it is critical that cms not move forward with this policy. further, should cms finalize this approach, the agency must also establish an appeal process for individual acos to submit information regarding errors they believe were made in the financial reconciliation calculation, determining the amount of shared savings earned by the aco or in determining an aco was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside the corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d. currently, cms does not provide a meaningful appeal process for individual acos. if cms will retain the right to terminate an aco for exceeding certain spending thresholds, cms must apply the materiality threshold to individual acos and allow acos to appeal redetermination decisions they believe were made in error and, therefore, hold acos harmless for errors the agency makes in the payment determination process.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900

to 30 days would provide more time for acos to evaluate program data and performance before deciding to terminate from the program without financial reconciliation for that year.\n we have significant concerns regarding the june 30 deadline proposed for acos electing to voluntarily terminate from the program. we urge cms not to finalize this policy as using a june 30 deadline for voluntary termination would mean that acos would not have the data they need to make an informed choice about their continued participation in the program. that data would not be available until later in the year due to the timing of distributing performance reports. acos should have three quarters of experience available to them to make a decision about their continued participation in the program.\n risk adjustment\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to implement the same risk adjustment policy across medicare programs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 as an interim step to implementing consistent risk adjustment policies across medicare programs, naacos supports the proposal to modify mssp risk adjustment by eliminating the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to allow risk score changes during an agreement period but urges the agency to use a more appropriate range of +/- 5 percent and to cap the risk ratios in aggregate across the four beneficiary enrollment types.\n proposals: cms proposes to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries for the purposes of mssp risk adjustment. the agency also proposes to use a symmetric +/-3 percent risk ratio cap between the performance year renormalized risk score and the most recent benchmark year for all assigned beneficiaries. cms would continue to use full cms-hierarchal condition category (hcc) risk adjustment for all assigned beneficiaries between the benchmark period and the performance year, and the risk scores would continue to be renormalized within each of the four beneficiary enrollment types. similarly, cms would continue to use full cms- hcc risk scores when resetting or rebasing the historical benchmark prior to each new agreement period.\n comments: risk adjustment modifies costs to reflect beneficiary health status and plays a critical role in enabling more accurate comparisons across acos and providers that treat beneficiaries of varying clinical complexity. there have been long-standing concerns about the mssp risk adjustment methodology, which cms acknowledges in the proposed rule, stating on page 41884:\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe appreciate the concerns regarding our current risk adjustment methodology raised by stakeholders, who have indicated that the current approach may not adequately recognize negative changes in health status that occur at the individual beneficiary level, particularly among continuously assigned beneficiaries who have experienced an acute event, such as a heart attack, stroke, or hip fracture, between the third benchmark year and the applicable performance year. we recognize that such acute events, which almost always require a hospitalization, are likely to have an upward impact on cms-hcc risk scores that is not attributable to provider coding initiatives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n participate in the mssp. as an interim step to implementing the same risk adjustment policy across medicare programs, we offer the following recommendations in response to those proposals in the pathways to success rule.\n the current mssp policy that treats beneficiaries differently depending on whether they are considered newly or continuously assigned creates unnecessary confusion and complexity. cms is in effect limiting risk adjustment due to demographic factors for continuously assigned beneficiaries. it is unreasonable to assume a provider organization, however effective, can manage a population such that patient conditions never worsen over time and it never carries a higher disease burden. therefore, we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to eliminate the newly and continuously assigned beneficiary categories and recommend additional changes to the risk adjustment proposals.\n we appreciate aspects of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow risk scores for beneficiaries to change somewhat over time, which begins to recognize the reality that patient risk scores fluctuate. it is essential that benchmarks reflect these risk changes so that acos are fairly judged on their performance without being unfairly expected to manage an overall population\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease burden with virtually no changes during an agreement period. naacos has repeatedly advocated for cms to permit meaningful increases in beneficiary risk scores over time. while the proposal would permit an increase of up to 3 percent, it is important to note that 3 percent is across a five-year agreement period and is not a year-over-year increase.\n though we appreciate the agency allowing risk score increases, the selection of 3 percent is arbitrary and insufficient when applied across a five-year agreement. for example, assuming that an aco starts in july 2019, the most that the risk score used in the updated benchmark calculation can change in performance year six (2024) would be between 97 to 103 percent of the 2018 risk score (based on 2017 hcc coding practices). this risk adjustment proposal would be reasonable in early years of the agreement period, when most acos would hit the 3 percent cap, but it would not be reasonable when applied to later years of the agreement. using mssp py 2017 results, 87 percent of acos would have had at least one enrollment type trigger the +/-3 percent cap when looking at the first three years of the agreement period. the average percentage capped in the first performance year of the agreement period is 88 percent, in the second performance year is 85 percent and the third performance year is 92 percent. over the fourth and fifth performance years we would expect the percentage of acos affected by the risk score cap to increase. we recommend cms finalize a policy that allows risk score adjustments during the course of the agreement period, but we urge a more reasonable threshold of +/- 5 percent. this is the threshold at which the percentage of capped aco populations within the same enrollment type drops below 25 percent based on the 2017 mssp results.\n alternative to the proposal, we support cms capping the risk ratios in aggregate across the four beneficiary enrollment types (esrd, disabled, aged/dual eligible, and aged/non-dual eligible). the different enrollment types show significantly different cap rates with aged/dual the highest at 59 percent capped and aged/non-dual the lowest at 24 percent capped in 2017 due to smaller sample sizes and volatility for certain enrollment types. we recommend cms finalize capping the enrollment types in aggregate instead of separately by enrollment type conjunction with the broader +/- 5 percent cap in order to further promote benchmark stability.\n finally, in order to reduce benchmark volatility, the risk adjustment model version should be consistent between the baseline and performance years. for example, the version 23 cms-hcc model could be used when comparing risk scores in the 2016-2018 baseline period to those in the 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2024 performance period. the next generation aco program follows this convention demonstrating that it is administratively feasible to maintain a consistent risk adjustment model version throughout the baseline and performance periods.\n benchmarking methodology\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south,

regional expenditure component to 50 percent and recommends that agency maintain the current maximum of 70 percent of regional expenditures in the third agreement and subsequent agreement periods. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos does not support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a symmetric +/- 5 percent cap based on national per capita expenditures and recommends the agency not finalize this. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to find an appropriate balance between a national and regional trend rate, but instead of finalizing the proposal we request the agency remove aco beneficiaries from the regional reference population to address the underlying problem. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to reverse its position on adjusting rebased benchmarks to account for the average per capita amount of savings generated during an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous agreement period by adding those savings back to the rebased benchmark. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to adjust the mssp benchmarking methodology to remove certain expenditures such as those related to mips payment adjustments, cpc+ care management fees and hospital wage index changes.\n proposals: cms proposes a number of benchmarking changes that, if finalized, would go into effect along with the revised mssp structure. many of the proposals relate to incorporating a regional expenditure component into the rebased benchmark, a direction the agency finalized in 2016 with the mssp rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 revised benchmark rebasing methodology, facilitating transition to performance-based risk, and administrative finality of financial calculations (published in the june 10, 2016 federal register). under that regulation, which remains in place as existing policy, cms incorporates a growing component of regional expenditures into benchmarks as they are rebased for new agreement periods. in this rule, cms proposes to incorporate regional expenditures into benchmarks sooner, beginning with initial agreement periods and to cap the maximum amount of regional expenditures at 50 percent. this would modify the phase-in schedule such that acos would have a regional expenditure component of:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 25 or 35 percent during the first agreement period, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 35 or 50 percent during the second agreement period, and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 50 percent during third and subsequent agreement periods.\n consistent with current policy, acos with spending higher than their region would receive the lower adjustment, and acos with spending lower than their region would receive the higher adjustment. cms also proposes to introduce a symmetric +/- 5 percent cap, implemented separately for each beneficiary category, and based on national per capita expenditures. if an aco is considered a re-entering aco, cms proposes to apply the regional adjustment percentage that was used in the most recent agreement. cms also proposes to use a blend of national and regional trend factors to trend forward benchmark year (by)1 and by2 to by3 when determining the historical benchmark and a blend of national and regional update factors to update the historical benchmark to the performance year (or to calendar year 2019 in the context of determining the financial performance of acos for the six-month performance year from july 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019). the national component of the blended trend and update factors would receive a weight equal to the share of assignable beneficiaries in the regional service area that are assigned to the aco, computed by taking a weighted average of county-level shares. the regional component of the blended trend and update factors would receive a weight equal to 1 minus the national weight.\n comments: naacos supports incorporating a component of regional expenditure data into aco benchmarks. rather than exclusively relying on regional expenditure data we specifically support blending aco historical and regional expenditure data for rebased benchmarks. relying exclusively on regional expenditure data for rebased benchmarks would not properly reflect an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique patient population. relying exclusively on historical aco expenditure data creates an unattainable situation where acos have decreased ability to beat ever-lowering benchmarks. if executed correctly, using benchmarks with a blend of historical and regional expenditure data will attract new acos while retaining existing participants and ultimately improve the long-term viability of the program.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n we support the proposal to introduce a regional expenditure component into the initial agreement period, rather than waiting until at least the second agreement period. this is especially important with longer, five-year agreement periods. we also strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued application of one of two regional expenditure components based on how the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending compares to that of its region, and the proposed 25 percent and 35 percent thresholds are appropriate. we recommend cms finalize these as proposed.\n as cms gradually introduces regional expenditures, for third and subsequent agreement periods we urge the agency not to finalize its proposal to cap regional expenditures at 50 percent. this is a decrease from the current policy of applying a maximum of 70 percent regional expenditure data. this policy was finalized two years ago and given the phase-in schedule of regional expenditure data, acos have not yet reached this level so it is premature to reverse this policy. we support a maximum of 70 percent of regional expenditures in the third agreement and subsequent agreement periods and recommend the following phase-in schedule such that acos would have a regional expenditure component of:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 25 or 35 percent during the first agreement period, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 45 or 60 percent during the second agreement period, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 70 percent during third and subsequent agreement periods\n we also urge cms to allow an option for acos to gradually incorporate regional expenditure data by 10 percent annually into their benchmarks during an agreement period. some acos will face significant swings in their aco benchmarks as a result of the revised methodology and allowing a gradual implementation would ease this transition rather than require acos to face large swings at the start of an agreement period. we reiterate our recommendation that this should be an option, and acos that are prepared to face more significant changes at the start of an agreement should be permitted to do so. overall, acos would ultimately reach the 70 percent regional benchmark, but providing program flexibility would keep acos progressing on the right path in a more reasonable manner that incentivizes them to stay in the program and continue focusing on reducing costs and improving quality.\n in response to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a symmetric +/- 5 percent cap based on national per capita expenditures, we are concerned that this will unnecessarily limit market forces that would naturally constrain outliers resulting from implementation of regional expenditures into rebased benchmarks. in the proposed rule, cms notes its concern that the agency should guard against the effect of large positive or negative regional adjustments resulting from the revised benchmarking methodology by imposing a cap on the dollar amount of the regional adjustment. however, we do not agree that cms should intervene in the market in this manner and instead should allow competition among acos and other providers to address and eventually mitigate outlier situations. should the agency move forward with implementing such a cap, we recommend a more reasonable range of +/- 7 percent as opposed to +/- 5 percent.\n in response to concerns raised by naacos and others, cms proposes to no longer use a pure regional update factor, which disadvantages acos that make up a large portion of the market in their region. instead, cms proposes to modify the update factor by using a national-regional blended trend rate that would be based on the share of assignable beneficiary weighted national ffs and regional update factors. the national-regional blending factor would be determined by averaging the market penetration across all counties where the aco has assigned beneficiaries. this proposal is a step in the right direction to address some of our concerns with the regional update factor; however, we have concerns that the new methodology may over-emphasize the national trend component. there are pitfalls with solely using a national update factor, which ignores important local market dynamics and regional trends, and with using an exclusively regionally-based update factor, which as currently structured penalizes acos in rural areas and those that comprise a large share of their market and, therefore, drive regional trends.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n address the underlying problem caused by including aco beneficiaries in the population from which the regional expenditure data is drawn. in fact, a simpler solution to the proposed national-regional trend rate would be to remove aco beneficiaries from the regional reference population as naacos has previously recommended. by excluding aco beneficiaries from the regional reference population, the situation where an aco is being directly evaluated against itself within the same performance year is eliminated.\n naacos and others have repeatedly made this recommendation to cms, including in our comment letter in response to the 2016 mssp rule, and our concerns remain the same. rather than comparing acos to themselves and other acos, cms should compare aco performance relative to ffs medicare by defining the regional population as assignable beneficiaries without aco-assigned beneficiaries for all acos in the region. at the very least, cms should exclude the aco itself from the region to prevent an otherwise tautological comparison that essentially double counts those aco-assigned beneficiaries. in an area where the aco has significant market saturation, it is especially essential to remove the aco beneficiaries from the regional population to avoid comparing the aco to itself.\n excluding all aco-assigned beneficiaries (those involved in mssp acos and well as other cms aco demonstrations such as the next generation model) also allows for a cleaner comparison between acos and ffs. by including the aco-assigned beneficiary population, the regional cost data is skewed by reflecting acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to coordinate care and reduce expenditures for the aco population. cms has expressed concerns that removing aco-assigned beneficiaries would result in an insufficient reference population. however, according to our analysis based on 2017 data, if cms removed aco-assigned beneficiaries from the service area no acos would have a reference population smaller than about 300,000 beneficiaries. further, the contribution of beneficiaries from very small and aco- dominated counties to the regional benchmark is minimal with only 47 (10 percent) 2017 acos exposed to one or the other, with such counties contributing only as much as 4 percent of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall assigned population. continuing a flawed program methodology in order to address a small percentage of acos is nonsensical and, more importantly, harmful to the majority of program participants. we urge cms to modify its policy by changing the definition of the reference population to exclude all aco-assigned beneficiaries.\n to address those acos whose reference population falls below 5,000 after removing the aco-assigned beneficiaries, we recommend cms use a modified approach to reach 5,000 beneficiaries in those instances. for example, cms could bridge the gap by increasing the weight of the counties that have a lower proportion of resident aco beneficiaries, and thus higher ffs population. another option would be for cms to expand the regional service area to include assignable beneficiaries in adjoining counties until a sufficient comparison group is reached. yet another option, recommended by medpac in their march 11, 2016 comment letter to cms, would increase the stability of the regional ffs spending calculations by increasing the number of years of data included in the calculation. for example, by using a five-year rolling average for county level spending estimates. in cases where area expenditures are driven largely by the acos, cms could similarly pull in contiguous counties to ensure a fair comparison. these approaches would both address cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concern about not having an adequate reference population and would be preferable to the current methodology.\n additionally, we recommend cms consider using a prospectively determined trend rate which would allow for greater predictability of financial results by acos. for example, prospective trend in us per capita cost is used to establish trend rates in the next generation model and medicare advantage programs. it is recommended that similar prospective trend approach be used in the mssp. finally, we urge cms to reverse its position on adjusting rebased benchmarks to account for the average per capita amount of savings generated during an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous agreement period by adding those savings back to the rebased benchmark. cms has changed its policy on adding aco savings back to benchmarks a few times, and the most recent policy finalized in the june 2016 mssp rule no longer adds these savings to benchmarks. this final policy was disappointing considering cms had previously expressed support for adding the savings back to benchmarks and in a june 2015 mssp rule stated:\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n who have achieved success in achieving the three-part aim in their first agreement, by lowering expenditures and improving both the quality of care provided to medicare ffs beneficiaries and the overall health of those beneficiaries. absent this adjustment, an aco who previously achieved success in the program may elect to terminate its participation in the program rather than face a lower benchmark that reflects the lower costs for its patient population during the three most recent prior years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (80 fr 32778)\n savings generated by acos are achieved as a result of their hard work to improve quality and lower costs. acos should be accountable for their performance relative to ffs medicare in their region and rewarded \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not penalized - for previous savings. thus, we urge cms not only to account for the earned shared savings in rebased benchmarks, but also to account for all savings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and add that amount to rebased benchmarks. at a very minimum, cms should return to the policy in the 2015 mssp rule which accounts for a portion of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s savings in rebased benchmarks.\n along with the benchmark adjustments discussed above, we urge cms to implement other benchmark adjustments so as to not hold acos accountable for specific expenditures that are inconsistent between the benchmark and performance years. for example, cms should adjust benchmarks to hold constant changes from the hospital wage index, as these payment changes can be notable and are not reflective of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population management efforts but can dramatically effect on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to accurately demonstrate savings or losses.\n as discussed previously in this letter, we also urge cms to exclude mips bonuses as aco expenditures. the current cms policy unfairly punishes acos for their high performance by both requiring track 1 acos (and basic levels a, b, c and d as proposed) to participate in mips, excluding such acos from advanced apm bonuses and counting any mips bonuses earned for high performance in that program as aco expenditures. cms excludes advanced apm bonuses from aco expenditures and should do the same for mips expenditures. this will be increasingly important over time as mips bonuses rise in future program years. not removing mips bonuses as aco expenditures will result in fewer acos being able to surpass their msr and could cause acos in basic levels c and d to have to repay losses. cms makes claim-level adjustments by adding sequestration costs back to paid amounts when calculating aco expenditures and should follow a similar policy to adjust for mips payment adjustments. it was not the intent of congress to penalize acos in mips, and therefore cms must alter this policy.\n finally, we urge cms to remove cpc+ care management fees from aco expenditures. while we appreciate the opportunity for mssp primary care practices to participate in cpc+, the care management fees should not be included as expenditures for aco benchmarks. these funds are paid to the participant tins and should be viewed as separate from other payments for furnishing care to beneficiaries. by not removing these care management fees from aco expenditures, cms penalizes acos with practices that receive these payments which are often used to invest in care coordination activities that will provide long-term benefits to patients. this creates an unhelpful tension between cpc+ and acos, rather than an approach that would harmonize the two programs. we urge cms to address this by removing cpc+ fees from aco expenditures.\n 2019 participation options\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to provide next gen acos with the opportunity to participate in the revised mssp using the july 1 start date.\n proposals: cms is opening a new round of applications for 2019 with a shortened six-month performance period in 2019 due to the late nature of the regulation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release. for aco agreements that expire at the end of 2018, acos will have the option to extend current agreements for six months while offering a special, one-time july 1, 2019 start date for new agreements. the july 1, 2019 start will have a spring 2019 application period, and this start date option is also available to new acos. cms staff have also confirmed with naacos that as proposed acos within current agreement periods under mssp participation options (track 1, track 2, or track 3) would be able to complete the remainder of their current agreement under the existing financial models and requirements.\n program participation options are limited in some cases for acos with experience in a performance-based risk model as well as for acos designated as high revenue. additionally, participation options are determined in part based on whether cms considers an aco to be new, renewing, or re-entering. cms proposes to allow new acos to begin in level a of the basic track, and they would stay in the shared savings-only option (level b in performance year (py) 2) for the first two consecutive performance years. only acos that are inexperienced with performance-based risk can elect to participate in the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glidepath. acos identified as experienced with performance-based risk must enter the basic track at level e if considered a low-revenue aco and must enter in the enhanced track if considered a high-revenue aco. low-revenue acos could participate in the basic track for up to two agreement periods, while high-revenue acos would be restricted to one agreement period in the basic track.\n cms proposes to define \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing acos\u00e2\u0080\u009d as those that continue in the program for a consecutive agreement period without a break in participation and are either:\n1. acos whose participation agreements expired and they immediately enter new agreement periods to \n continue participation in the program; or\n2. acos that voluntarily terminated their current participation agreements and they immediately enter new \n agreement periods to continue participation in the program.\n cms proposes to define \u00e2\u0080\u009cre-entering acos\u00e2\u0080\u009d as those that do not meet the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d and are either:\n1. the same legal entity as (a) an aco whose participation agreement expired without having been \n renewed; or (b) an aco whose aco participation agreement was terminated, or\n2. a new legal entity with more than 50 percent of its aco participants included on the aco participant list \n of the same aco in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date. re- entering acos are ineligible for level a and must begin at level b of the basic track.\n cms proposes to define acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced with performance-based risk\u00e2\u0080\u009d if either of the following are met:\n1. the aco is the same legal entity as a current or previous participant in a performance-based risk \n medicare aco initiative; or\n2. 40 percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco \n initiative in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n finally, cms defines \u00e2\u0080\u009cperformance-based risk medicare aco initiative\u00e2\u0080\u009d as: basic track, enhanced track (track 3), track 2, track 1+ model, pioneer aco model, next generation aco model, and comprehensive end-stage renal disease (esrd) care model two-sided risk tracks. all acos can elect to participate in the enhanced track. tables 6 and 7 in the proposed rule on pages 41833-41834

participation and gather all of the required information to submit applications, it is critical that cms continue to offer a participation option for 2019. naacos has concerns regarding complexity caused by the introduction of two, six- month performance periods with some acos operating under current program rules and others operating under new program rules. we request that cms clarify how such details will be handled (please see our detailed comments below under \u00e2\u0080\u009cassessing six-month performance periods in 2019\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\n in addition, we urge cms to provide acos with agreements expiring in 2018 the option of extending their current participation agreements from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019. providing this option would give acos additional time to analyze program changes and prepare for the application process while reducing complexity. cms must also provide acos with opportunities to add and delete participants throughout the performance periods offered in 2019 and clarify when such opportunities will be permitted.\n additionally, naacos urges cms to provide next gen acos with the opportunity to participate in mssp using the july 1 start date option. cmmi has finalized many changes for the final two years of the next generation model, 2019 and 2020, and some acos have concerns about certain revisions. as such, we urge cms to work closely with cmmi to provide an opportunity for interested next gen acos to transition to mssp effective july 1, 2019 without having to sit out of an accountable care model for the start of 2019. allowing a smooth and timely transition will enable interested acos and providers to avoid disruption in their accountable care goals while moving from one program to the other.\n naacos supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to define acos re-entering or renewing. however, we disagree with the proposal to limit participation options for acos with any experience in performance-based risk models. particularly in cases where the aco may have only participated in such a model for one performance year, we do not feel it is justified to limit an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation to either the basic level e or enhanced track options. additionally, as noted previously in this comment letter, the levels of risk required for the enhanced track are a large jump from those required in basic level e. given this dramatic increase, cms should not force acos to participate in the enhanced track. instead, we recommend cms only limit an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation to basic level e if such aco had completed at least one agreement period in a performance-based risk model. further, and echoed in our comments above on the proposed high/low revenue distinction, we do not support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to require high revenue acos with experience in performance-based risk models to participate in the enhanced track. in fact, we urge cms not to finalize the arbitrary distinction of high- and low-revenue acos, and we oppose requirements that high-revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or any acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e.\n assessing six-month performance periods in 2019 key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos appreciates cms proposals to offer aco participation options in 2019. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed policies governing how shared savings and losses will be calculated for the six-month performance periods in 2019. however, cms must clarify and provide additional education to acos concerning how certain operational details will be addressed. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms must clarify how quality reporting would take place for six-month performance periods that will be based on 12 months of data and how such reporting will be considered in mips.\n proposals: cms proposes to reconcile the financial and quality performance of acos that participated in the mssp in 2019. given the varying participation options in 2019, cms proposes to treat each six-month period separately for purposes of calculating financial and quality performance. these calculations would be reconciled based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance during the entire 12-month calendar year, but cms would prorate the calendar year shared savings or losses based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance during the applicable six-month period.\n january 1, 2019 to june 30, 2019\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900

retrospective reconciliation, the assignment window would be calendar year 2019. for acos under prospective assignment, cms proposes the assignment window would be october 1, 2017 through september 30, 2018, with beneficiaries remaining prospectively assigned to the aco at the end of calendar year 2019 unless the beneficiary meets certain exclusion criteria. lastly, beneficiary assignment would be based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certified aco participant list for the agreement period beginning january 1, 2019.\n benchmark cms proposes to calculate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark and assigned beneficiary expenditures as though the six-month performance year were the entire calendar year. the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark would be determined according to the applicable methodology of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s track and agreement with cms, except that data from the entire calendar year 2019 would be used in place of data for the six-month performance year for the benchmarking approaches cms currently uses to update and adjust historical benchmarks. thus, the existing methodology would be used to determine the benchmark for the january 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 june 30, 2019 performance year by performing the following calculations: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 benchmarks would be adjusted for changes in severity and case mix between benchmark year three and calendar year 2019 using the current hcc risk score and demographic factors methodology; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 benchmarks would be updated to calendar year 2019 according to the methodology for using growth in either national or regional medicare ffs expenditures, depending on whether the aco is in its first or second agreement period and whether the second agreement period began in 2016 or 2017\u00e2\u0080\u00932019.\n financial performance cms would apply the methodology for determining shared savings and losses according to the track the aco is participating in on january 1, 2019, with the following exceptions to the applicable methodology implemented to calculate the expenditures for assigned beneficiaries over the full calendar year for purposes of determining the shared savings and losses for the six-month performance year: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 average per capita medicare parts a and b services expenditures for calendar year 2019 would be calculated for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance year assigned beneficiary population; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms would compare the expenditures to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark, determined for calendar year 2019 as listed above; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms would apply the msr or mlr, if applicable; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms would prorate any amounts of shared savings or losses by multiplying those amounts by 50 percent, which represents the portion of the calendar year covered by the six-month performance year.\n quality performance for acos participating in tracks where shared savings or losses are affected by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance, cms would multiply the difference between the updated benchmark expenditures by the applicable msr or mlr based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance.\n july 1, 2019 to december 31, 2019\n cms proposes to apply the same general methodological steps for calculating prorated shared savings and losses as described above for the six-month performance year from january 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 june 30, 2019, except where the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreement and track stipulates a different methodology, for example, the benchmarking methodology or financial calculations specific to the track in which the aco participates.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac

urge cms to allow acos currently participating using prospective assignment who extend current agreements through june of 2019, the option to use the same assignment window for the july- december performance period to avoid unintended consequences and complexity caused by creating two assignment windows for these acos. additionally, cms must clarify how quality reporting will take place for six-month performance periods that cms states will be based on 12 months of data. in the proposed rule, cms notes the agency would use the certified aco participant list for the performance year starting on july 1, 2019, to determine the quality reporting samples for the 2019 reporting period for certain acos (acos that enter an agreement period beginning on july 1, 2019, including new acos, and acos that extended their prior participation agreement for the six-month performance year from january 1, 2019, to june 30, 2019, as well as acos that start a 12-month performance year on january 1, 2019, and terminate their participation agreement with an effective date of termination of june 30, 2019, and enter a new agreement period beginning on july 1, 2019). if an aco extends its participation to the first six months of 2019 but does not enter a new agreement period beginning on july 1, 2019, cms proposes to use the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest certified participant list (the aco participant list effective on january 1, 2019) to determine the quality reporting samples for the 2019 reporting period. beneficiary assignment for purposes of generating the quality reporting samples would be based on the assignment methodology applicable to the aco during its six-month performance year. given this, we assume all acos would only be responsible for reporting quality one time, during the typical january to march timeframe following the performance year. cms must clarify how such quality reporting will take place. cms must also clarify how such quality reporting will satisfy mips quality reporting requirements for acos subject to mips.\n beneficiary notification requirements key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos disagrees with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assumption that the current beneficiary notification process is underutilized, and we urge cms to maintain the current beneficiary notification process. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we recommend cms instead simplify marketing requirements to allow acos the flexibility to communicate more effectively with patients about the program.\n proposals: cms proposes to modify the current beneficiary notification requirements and instead would require a standard written notification be provided annually to medicare ffs beneficiaries at their first primary care visit of the performance year in the form and manner specified by cms. beginning july 1, 2019, the aco would also be required, as part of the beneficiary notification process, to inform the patient about the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to, and the process by which, he or she may identify or change identification of a primary care provider for purposes of voluntary alignment. under this proposal, an aco participant would be required to provide this notice during a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first primary care visit in the six-month performance year from july 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019, as well as the first primary care visit in the 12-month performance year that begins on january 1, 2020 and in all subsequent performance years. this notice would be in addition to the existing requirement that an aco participant must post signs in its facilities and make standardized written notices available upon request. comments: naacos recommends cms maintain current beneficiary notification requirements. cms previously implemented and later removed a requirement to provide a written annual beneficiary notification. cms made this change in response to confusion among beneficiaries and based on comments from acos the notification requirement was too burdensome. specifically, cms revised the requirement so that aco providers/suppliers must post signs in their facilities and by make the notice available to beneficiaries upon request. cms notes the agency is revisiting the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing requirement to ensure beneficiaries have a sufficient opportunity to be informed about the program and how it may affect their care and data. cms also notes concern that the existing information on the program is provided to patients in separate resources, which may be time consuming for beneficiaries to compile and may be underutilized.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n burdens on acos by proposing acos use a template notification provided by cms, naacos notes that previously cms provided template language that was confusing to patients. this confusion prompted numerous calls and questions, and it distracted clinicians from proving patient care. as a more effective alternative, we recommend cms maintain current beneficiary notification requirements and allow acos increased flexibility to communicate with patients about the program using methods, such as including language on the aco websites as well as phone- recorded messages. currently, aco communication to beneficiaries is limited due to unnecessary marketing requirements preventing communication with a patient. these requirements inhibit an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to explain the benefits and services provided by acos. cms must allow acos to invest resources in the ways the organization finds most effective. this requirement is unnecessary and therefore a drain on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s limited resources. therefore, naacos urges cms to not finalize its proposals and instead focus on simplifying aco marketing requirements to provide acos with more flexibility in communicating effectively with the patients and community they serve.\n beneficiary assignment changes\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports the proposal to modify the definition of primary care services to include additional services if finalized as proposed in the 2019 medicare physician fee schedule (mpfs) proposed rule. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos strongly supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to provide acos with more flexibility in selecting a prospective or retrospective assignment methodology on an annual basis, and we urge cms to finalize this proposal. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms to reconsider its proposal to include specialists in the voluntary alignment process when a beneficiary elects such a professional as their primary care clinician, if the beneficiary does not receive primary care services from an aco professional in the aco. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos opposes cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed introduction of a new optional assignment method, the beneficiary opt- in assignment methodology, and instead we urge cms to improve upon the current voluntary alignment process by creating an automated system to support this assignment methodology.\n proposals: cms proposes to revise the definition of primary care services to include the following healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) and current procedural terminology (cpt) codes: (1) advance care planning service codes, cpt codes 99497 and 99498; (2) administration of health risk assessment service codes, cpt codes 96160 and 96161; (3) prolonged evaluation and management or psychotherapy service(s) beyond the typical service time of the primary procedure, cpt codes 99354 and 99355; (4) annual depression screening service code, hcpcs code g0444; (5) alcohol misuse screening service code, hcpcs code g0442; and (6) alcohol misuse counseling service code, hcpcs code g0443. in addition, if finalized as proposed in the 2019 mpfs proposed rule, cms would add these three new hcpcs codes to the mssp assignment methodology: (1) gpc1x add-on code, for the visit complexity inherent to evaluation and management associated with certain primary care services; (2) gcg0x add-on code, for visit complexity inherent to evaluation and management associated with endocrinology, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, urology, neurology, obstetrics/gynecology, allergy/immunology, otolaryngology, or interventional pain management-centered care; and (3) gpro1, an additional add-on code for prolonged evaluation and management or psychotherapy services beyond the typical service time of the primary procedure.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac

provide more flexibility in choosing prospective or retrospective assignment for basic and enhanced acos, as required by the bipartisan budget act (bba). specifically, for acos entering agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years, cms proposes to allow acos annually to elect the beneficiary assignment methodology (i.e., preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation or prospective assignment) to apply for each remaining performance year within their agreement period. cms also proposes to provide an opportunity for acos to switch their selection of beneficiary assignment methodology on an annual basis, which would be done prior to the start of a new performance year.\n finally, as required by the bba, cms proposes adjustments to the voluntary alignment process. cms proposes to modify current policies to assign a beneficiary to an aco based upon his or her selection of any aco professional, regardless of specialty, as his or her primary clinician. under this proposal, a beneficiary may select a practitioner with any specialty designation as his or her primary care provider and be eligible for voluntary alignment assignment to the aco in which the practitioner is an aco professional. currently the aco professional designated by the beneficiary must be a primary care physician as defined at \u00e2\u00a7425.20, a physician with a specialty designation included at \u00e2\u00a7425.402(c), or a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist. cms proposes to use a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designation to align the beneficiary to the aco in which his or her primary clinician participates even if the beneficiary does not receive primary care services from an aco professional in that aco. cms proposes that the agency will not assign a beneficiary to the aco when the beneficiary is also eligible for assignment to an entity participating in a model tested or expanded under section 1115a of the act under which claims-based assignment is based solely on claims for services other than primary care services and for which there has been a determination by secretary that a waiver is necessary solely for purposes of testing the model.\n comments: naacos supports the proposal to modify the definition of primary care services to include additional services if finalized as proposed in the 2019 mpfs proposed rule. assignment is a critical program methodology that determines the beneficiary population for which an aco is held accountable. cms should continue to refine the primary care codes used in assignment to ensure the list used for acos is consistent with current billing practices. naacos also strongly supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to provide acos with more flexibility in selecting a prospective or retrospective assignment methodology on an annual basis, and we urge cms to finalize this proposal. naacos has long advocated for cms to provide acos with this much needed flexibility, and we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal.\n naacos has concerns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals to modify the voluntary alignment process to include specialists in the voluntary assignment process if the beneficiary elects such a professional as his/her primary clinician. specifically, we have concerns regarding unintended consequences of this policy, and we request cms not to finalize this proposal. we recommend at a minimum if cms finalizes its proposal to include specialists in the voluntary alignment process it use an approach that overrides the existing claims-based assignment methodology only when a beneficiary has at least one qualified primary care service (based on the existing services used for mssp assignment) during the previous or current performance year with an aco professional as defined under step 1 or step 2 of mssp assignment.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n\n altering the attribution process to require beneficiaries to actively elect an aco would create insurmountable administrative complexities and would be confusing to beneficiaries. one of the unique aspects of the aco program is that the organization cares for all patients in the same manner, not knowing who will ultimately be attributed to the aco for the purposes of program calculations to determine quality and cost metrics for the aco. this results in acos treating all patients as potentially included in their aco and results in high quality, coordinated care for all beneficiaries. the current voluntary patient alignment option launched in 2017 has been underutilized and creates confusion among beneficiaries. we urge cms not to finalize the new beneficiary opt-in approach and continue to make any patient alignment options voluntary.\n naacos has long advocated for cms to incorporate voluntary alignment, and we were pleased that cms finalized its decision to do so in the final 2017 mpfs. however, as this option was only introduced beginning with performance year 2018, there are several areas cms must improve on to increase use of the option by beneficiaries. the functionality to designate a primary clinician was added to the mymedicare.gov website in june 2017. if a beneficiary has existing favorite clinicians from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy health\u00e2\u0080\u009d web page on mymedicare.gov, he or she can select \u00e2\u0080\u009cadd as my primary clinician.\u00e2\u0080\u009d if a beneficiary does not have a mymedicare.gov account, one must be created. beneficiaries can receive assistance with mymedicare.gov, including help to set up an account and/or designate a primary clinician by calling 1-800-medicare (1-800-633-4227). the my medicare help page notes that a primary clinician is the healthcare provider that a beneficiary believes is responsible for coordinating his or her overall care. once a beneficiary aligns to a qualifying clinician in an aco, he or she will be assigned to that aco until he or she removes the clinician as primary practitioner or he or she no longer meets the beneficiary eligibility assignment requirements or the requirements necessary for voluntary alignment. this process can be cumbersome and time consuming for beneficiaries unfamiliar with cms website. we recommend cms modify the voluntary alignment process by allowing beneficiaries to make this designation over the phone by calling the 1-800-medicare or through the physician compare website. we also request cms include more information in beneficiary communications about the importance of this designation and the role acos play in providing high quality, coordinated and efficient care. we urge cms to implement these changes and to consult with acos as the agency works to further improve the voluntary alignment process.\n payment rule waivers\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to finalize its proposal to expand eligibility for the skilled nursing facility (snf) three- day rule waiver to include acos participating in a two-sided model under preliminary prospective assignment. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms to finalize the proposal to include snf services furnished under swing bed arrangements, as this proposal addresses concerns of acos in rural areas that have fewer available snfs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand certain telehealth waivers to treat the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home as an originating site and not apply the originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services furnished by a practitioner participating in two-sided aco models. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms to implement proposed telehealth waiver changes effective july 1, 2019, consistent with the proposals for the expansion of the snf waiver, to increase access and use of the waiver by acos. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to consider adding other critical patient engagement tools for acos, such as allowing npi-level participation, permitting acos to establish post-acute care networks, providing acos with upfront funding for transportation services, waiving certain post-discharge home visit supervision requirements to allow for broader use of these services by acos when clinically appropriate and afford all acos with the ability to provide waived co-payments for primary care services provided by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s providers to encourage patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use of these services.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n for quarters 1, 2, and 3 of the performance year for snf services provided after the beneficiary first appeared on one of the assignment lists for the applicable performance year. cms also clarifies that, for purposes of determining eligibility to partner with an aco for the snf three-day rule waiver, snfs include providers furnishing snf services under swing bed arrangements. in these instances, the three-star quality rating requirement would be waived.\n cms also proposes beginning with performance years 2020 and beyond, the agency would treat the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home as an originating site and not apply the originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services furnished by a physician or practitioner participating in an applicable aco. cms proposes to apply these policies to acos under a two-sided model that participate under the prospective assignment method, not a preliminary prospective assignment method.\n comments: naacos strongly supports cms proposals to expand access to certain payment rule waivers for acos participating in performance-based risk models. these tools serve as critical patient engagement tools necessary for success. we urge cms to finalize its proposal to expand eligibility for the snf three-day rule waiver to include acos participating in a two-sided model under preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation. we also appreciate the proposal to include snf services furnished under swing bed arrangements, as this proposal addresses concerns of acos in rural areas that have fewer available snfs. while we support these changes, we also urge cms to streamline the current snf waiver process that is burdensome and therefore results in fewer acos using the waiver. specifically, we recommend cms alter the current requirements that the patient has been evaluated and approved for admission to the snf within three days prior to the snf admission by an aco provider/supplier that is a physician, consistent with the aco's beneficiary evaluation and admission plan. instead, we urge cms to also allow other qualified healthcare professionals to evaluate the patient and approve the admission to the snf. requiring a physician to see the patient is arbitrary and results in unnecessary delays that do not improve the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care. further, snf affiliates must have and maintain an overall rating of three stars or higher under the cms five-star quality rating system. as a result, acos must currently continually look up a snf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality rating which is time consuming and adds significant burden. under the bundled payments for care improvement advanced (bpci-a) program, cms provides by email an xls file to participants with a list of snfs that are approved by cms to participate in the three-day rule waiver available in bpci-a. we recommend cms take a similar approach with acos to minimize burden associated with the current process.\n naacos also supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand certain telehealth waivers to treat the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home as an originating site and not apply the originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services furnished by a practitioner participating in two-sided aco models. however, we urge cms to implement such proposal effective july 1, 2019, consistent with the proposals for the expansion of the snf waiver, to increase access and use of the waiver by acos. acos consider telehealth a crucial tool for improving care coordination and reducing costs. in addition to these waivers, we urge cms to consider adding other critical patient engagement tools for acos, as detailed below.\n allowing npi-level participation/network management\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n manage patient care as a team, and the aco would communicate with these providers about the cost and quality implications of their care decisions\n allowing acos to establish post-acute care networks\n cms does not currently allow acos to encourage patients to seek care from providers the aco has identified as most efficient and high quality. unlike ma program, acos are unable to provide incentives for beneficiary engagement with the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most efficient providers. this in turn creates challenges for the aco in communicating with beneficiaries regarding their preferred providers for treatment. these are the providers engaged with the aco and focused on providing coordinated, high quality care. naacos recommends cms allow acos the same opportunities that are currently provided to ma plans to increase beneficiary engagement through incentives for beneficiaries choosing high quality, efficient providers that work collaboratively with the aco, particularly for post-acute care providers to ensure aco patients receive the highest quality care. in order to facilitate this request, cms must also provide more transparency around post-acute care admissions and quality metrics for post-acute care providers.\n providing acos upfront funding for transportation services\n lack of transportation is often cited as a barrier to healthcare access and can lead to missed appointments, delayed care, and ultimately poorer health outcomes. this issue is especially important for effectively managing patients with chronic diseases, who require more appointments and timely healthcare interventions as well as ongoing medication management. a literature review of research on this issue found that patients with a lower socioeconomic status had higher rates of transportation barriers to ongoing healthcare access than those with a higher socioeconomic status. this is a critical issue that, if addressed, could help to improve health outcomes, particularly for the patients that most need ongoing care. therefore, we recommend cms provide funding for acos to deliver transportation services to allow beneficiaries to seek the treatment they need. this could be provided as an upfront payment or as a defined member benefit. the transportation benefit could be billed by the healthcare provider, for example, providing eight trips for the patient and thereby giving transportation to and from the office for four visits for the patient. other payers currently utilize this approach, such as humana and providence health plan, and could be used as models.\n post-discharge home visits and primary care co-payments\n additionally, we urge cms to waive certain post-discharge home visit supervision requirements to allow for broader use of these services by acos when clinically appropriate. we ask that cms allow physicians to contract with licensed clinicians to provide these home visit services using general instead of direct supervision requirements specified at 42 cfr \u00e2\u00a7 410.32(b)(3). this will provide all acos with needed flexibility during the critical post-discharge time period. finally, we ask cms to afford all acos with the ability to provide waived co-payments for primary care services provided by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s providers to encourage patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use of these critical services. cms should afford all acos with every opportunity for success in reducing costs for their patients by allowing acos to use these high-value services, and we request that these waivers apply to all acos participating in performance-based risk models.\n providing acos upfront funding for social services\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900

(aim) program, providing targeted advanced loan payments to acos to provide such services.\n beneficiary incentive program\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a beneficiary incentive program for certain acos. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms provide the necessary funding for the beneficiary incentive program, as is done in the next generation aco program.\n proposals: cms proposes to allow any aco in track 2, levels c, d, or e of the basic track, or the enhanced track to establish a cms-approved beneficiary incentive program to provide incentive payments to eligible beneficiaries who receive qualifying services. as required by the bba, cms proposes a $20 payment limit, updated annually consistent with the consumer price index and rounded to the nearest dollar, and made no later than 30 days after the service. a beneficiary would be eligible to receive an incentive payment if the beneficiary is assigned to an aco through either preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation or prospective assignment.\n cms proposes the aco legal entity, not any participant providers or suppliers, must furnish the incentive directly to the beneficiary and that incentives must not be cash but may be cash equivalent (e.g., check or debit card). incentives must be non-medicare covered items and services, and acos must keep records of all incentive payments. cms proposes that acos must fully fund the costs of operating the beneficiary incentive program, including the cost of any incentive payments. acos are prohibited from accepting or using funds furnished by an outside entity, including, but not limited to, an insurance company, pharmaceutical company, or any other entity outside of the aco, to finance its beneficiary incentive program.\n cms proposes that incentive payments made by an aco shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating benchmarks, estimated average per capita medicare expenditures, and shared savings. cms also proposes to disregard incentive payments made by an aco for purposes of calculating shared losses. lastly, cms proposes a requirement that acos publicly report for each performance year the total number of beneficiaries who receive an incentive payment, the total number of incentive payments furnished, hcpcs codes associated with any qualifying payment for which an incentive payment was furnished, the total value of all incentive payments furnished, and the total type of each incentive payment (e.g., check or debit card) furnished.\n comments: naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a beneficiary incentive program for certain acos. as discussed above, such patient engagement tools are critical to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to better manage a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care. while we support this proposal, we have concerns with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to implementation, which would require the aco fully fund the costs of such a program. there are numerous upfront costs required to establish and maintain an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations. acos invest these dollars to support the model and efforts to transform patient care, sometimes never realizing these investment costs. those acos that do earn shared savings do not see such funds until years after the upfront investments have been made. therefore, it is unreasonable to expect the aco to fully fund the costs of such a program, and we urge cms instead provide such funding as is the case in the next generation aco program. at a minimum, cms should consider funding the program for the first year to support the cost of running such a program.\n quality changes\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900

not be required to report promoting interoperability (pi) and would instead see pi performance category weights redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative and asks that cms consider not only whether a measure is a process measure, but also whether the measure is considered a low-value process measure, before removing from aco quality measure sets. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to consider the addition of opioid use measures for potential inclusion in aco quality measure sets in future program years, and we recommend certain changes to such measures as detailed below. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms to exclude mips bonuses from aco expenditures.\n proposals: cms proposes to discontinue use of the quality measure 11 that assesses an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligible clinicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 level of adoption of cehrt. instead, cms proposes that for performance years starting on january 1, 2019 and subsequent performance years, acos in a track or a payment model within a track, which does not meet the financial risk standard to be an advanced apm, must attest and certify upon application to participate in the mssp and subsequently as part of the annual certification process that at least 50 percent of the eligible clinicians participating in the aco use cehrt to document and communicate clinical care to their patients or other health care providers. acos would be required to submit this certification in the form and manner specified by cms.\n cms also seeks feedback on ways to reduce burden and focus on meaningful quality measures as part of their meaningful measures initiative. under this initiative, cms states it is working towards assessing performance on only those core issues that are most vital to providing high-quality care and improving patient outcomes with an emphasis on outcome-based measures, reducing unnecessary burden on providers, and putting patients first.\n finally, cms is also considering the addition of one or more measures specific to opioid use to the aco quality measures set. the potential benefits of such policies would be to focus acos on the appropriate use of opioids for their assigned beneficiaries and support their opioid misuse prevention efforts. specifically, cms is considering the following relevant national quality forum (nqf)-endorsed measures with emphasis on medicare individuals with part d coverage who are 18 years or older without cancer or enrolled in hospice: nqf 2940, use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer; nqf 2950, use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer; nqf 2951, use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer.\n comments: naacos strongly supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to remove aco measure 11 and instead rely on attestation to evaluate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of cehrt. we appreciate cms responding to naacos requests to remove this measure and as a result rely on attestations as is done in the next generation aco model. we ask cms to clarify that acos subject to mips would not be required to report pi and would instead see pi performance category weights redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories. we agree that removal of this measure will reduce significant regulatory burdens; acos subject to mips (basic track levels a through d as proposed) should not be unfairly excluded from this policy. all acos demonstrate a commitment to use of ehrs, including acos in models not categorized as advanced apms. we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative and, in this role, we feel cms must also look to reduce the regulatory burden on acos to comply with mips requirements to the fullest extent possible. this includes making all program criteria and scoring methodologies for acos specifically accessible and transparent.\n as cms looks to future quality measure changes for acos, we urge the agency to consider not only whether a measure is considered a process measure but also what relative value the measure provides, when considering the burden associated with data collection and reporting of the measure. further, as cms considers annual measure changes, we note that each measure change results in administrative costs, such as changing work flows and ehrs for data collection and reporting.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n measurement and use of clinical practice guidelines to ensure patients have access to safer, more effective chronic pain treatment while reducing the number of people who misuse, abuse, or overdose from these drugs. cms specifically considers the following nqf-endorsed measures with emphasis on medicare individuals with part d coverage who are 18 years or older without cancer or enrolled in hospice: nqf 2940, use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer; nqf 2950, use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer; nqf 2951, use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer. we recommend changes to nqf 2940; this measure should instead align with the centers for disease control and prevention guidelines identifying patients for whom opioid prescriptions exceed 90 morphine milligram equivalents. it is important to include these measures on dose and duration of opioids prescribed. however, we urge cms to initially make such measures pay-for-reporting only as the measures are further refined with stakeholder input for use in the aco program.\n finally, we urge cms to exclude mips bonuses as aco expenditures. the current cms policy unfairly punishes acos for their high performance by both requiring track 1 acos (and basic levels a, b, c and d as proposed) to participate in mips, excluding such acos from advanced apm bonuses and counting any mips bonuses earned for high performance in that program as aco expenditures. cms currently excludes advanced apm bonuses from aco expenditures and we reiterate our request for cms do the same for mips expenditures. this will be increasingly important over time as mips bonuses are projected to rise in future program years. while aggregate program data has not yet been made available by cms, many acos have already reported perfect or nearly perfect scores in mips for 2017. these bonuses will then count against the aco when expenditures are calculated for purposes of mssp calculations. therefore, the better an aco and its eligible clinicians perform in mips, the greater they will be penalized when calculating shared savings/losses for the aco. this is an unfair and untenable policy. although cms argues that the agency has maintained this policy under the value-based payment modifier program, naacos believes cms has the authority and ability to remove mips expenditures from aco benchmark calculations. in fact, cms does make claim-level adjustments by adding sequestration costs back to paid amounts when calculating aco expenditures. it was not the intent of congress to penalize acos in mips, and therefore cms must alter this policy.\n repayment mechanisms\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to remove the requirement for tail period coverage and to lower the repayment mechanism amounts for basic track levels c, d and e. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand the acceptable institutions providing a repayment mechanism to include any insured institution, including credit unions. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports using the most recent data available to establish a repayment mechanism amount, requests cms increase the threshold that would trigger a higher repayment mechanism amount and provide symmetry by allowing decreases in repayment mechanism amounts during an agreement period. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos requests that cms provide new repayment mechanisms, including reinstating reinsurance and introducing an option for a future withhold of medicare payments.\n proposals: as with current risk-based models, acos in the revised mssp would be required to demonstrate their ability to repay losses by establishing a sufficient repayment mechanism, including funds placed in escrow, a letter of credit, a surety bond, or a combination of those mechanisms. the agency proposes to expand the acceptable institutions providing a repayment mechanism to include any insured institution, including credit unions. the agency also proposes to extend the duration of the repayment mechanism, which would need to be in place for the number of risk-based years in the agreement period plus an additional 24 months of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctail coverage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms proposes to use the most recent calendar year having 12 months of available data to establish the repayment mechanism amount.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n amount equal to 1 percent of total assigned beneficiary expenditures (benchmark-based standard). the agency notes its efforts to minimize administrative burdens by proposing that acos with a repayment mechanism would be permitted to extend its duration for the basic or enhanced tracks. in the event that any of the following occur, cms proposes that the repayment mechanism may be terminated.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 shared losses have been fully repaid for all performance years. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms has exhausted the amount. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms determines that shared losses are not owed.\n comments: securing a repayment mechanism is a regulatory burden, which is time consuming and costly for acos. many acos cite the burden and cost of securing a repayment mechanism as reasons not to move to a risk-based aco model. instead of requiring a repayment mechanism that pays banks and brokers and takes money away from the aco executing its core mission of improving patient care, we urge cms to remove the repayment mechanism requirement when an aco can prove that it has an investor or financial backer with a demonstrated high credit rating. financial backers could include outside investors, insurers or hospitals or health systems that are involved with the aco and providing financial support, which would be available should losses occur. this assurance would protect the medicare trust fund in the event the aco has losses while avoiding the financial inefficiency and regulatory burden of involving outside financial institutions as third parties that benefit from the repayment mechanism requirements. this would also eliminate the need to have a 24-month tail period.\n the additional burden of a 24-month \u00e2\u0080\u009ctail period\u00e2\u0080\u009d heightens concerns and increases financial requirements for acos. should cms maintain requirements for a repayment mechanism, we request the agency to minimize this regulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for tail period coverage, which is especially important considering the longer agreement periods cms proposes. should the agency retain a tail period, we also urge the agency to ensure that cms is equally liable to pay for additional shared savings if discovered up to 24 months following the agreement period and this should be noted in the mssp participation agreements.\n we further recommend cms reduce the repayment mechanism requirements, especially for the lower risk basic track levels c, d and e. for these levels, cms should only require a guarantee equal to 0.5 percent of total benchmark expenditures or 1 percent of ffs revenue.  those amounts are sufficient to prompt third-party due diligence and establish credit worthiness within the probable range of shared losses. this reduction makes sense especially in light of the 30 percent loss sharing rate in these levels that correspondingly reduces the likelihood of net losses.\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand the acceptable institutions providing a repayment mechanism to include any insured institution, including credit unions. this would provide more options than the current requirement to only utilize federal deposit insurance corporation-insured institutions. allowing access to credit unions may provide more economical alternatives and increase market competition, which could potentially lower the overall cost of accessing repayment mechanisms. we recommend cms finalize this expansion of acceptable institutions as proposed.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005

window, such as 60 days, for acos changing repayment mechanisms. updating repayment mechanisms may happen over time as a result of organizational changes, needs, and availability of specific repayment mechanisms.\n we also request that cms provide new repayment mechanisms, including reinstating reinsurance and introducing an option for a future withhold of medicare payments as repayment mechanisms. we request cms restore reinsurance as a qualifying repayment mechanism, which it was until cms removed it in the june 2015 final mssp rule. the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rationale for doing so was that few acos were using this option. however, we question that logic considering how few risk-bearing acos there were at that time. further, despite limited initial use of reinsurance for demonstrating ability to repay losses to cms, this continues to be an option which some acos pursue separate from their cms obligations. therefore, we see no harm in cms reinstating reinsurance as an option, and we urge cms to do so for all two-sided aco tracks/models.\n under the macra financial risk standards, the agency may allow a reduction of payment rates to the apm entity and/or the apm entity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligible clinicians as one option for repaying losses. we urge cms to develop an option for acos to repay losses through reduced payment rates of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligible clinicians in future years. through this mechanism, cms would identify the tin/ npi combinations that participate in the aco for a specific performance period and, similar to downward payment adjustments under mips, cms would reduce the payment rates for those tin/npis by a certain percent in a future payment adjustment year to recoup the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s losses. acos would include language in the agreement between the aco and its participant tins and their individual practitioners detailing specifics of this repayment mechanism. allowing acos to choose this as one of the mechanisms to repay losses would provide a new option that some acos may prefer over repaying losses in a lump sum. we urge cms to work collaboratively with us to further develop this concept and the key details that would be needed to implement it.\n extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to revise the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy to provide a trend/growth rate that is the higher of the national assignable rate or the regional rate. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we strongly recommend cms award a quality score that is the greater of the quality score earned in the performance year affected by the extreme circumstance, the prior year quality score, or the national mean quality score. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms should consider introducing ways to more accurately account for impact of natural disasters, for example, identifying ways to identify natural disaster related impact at the beneficiary and claims level through the use of modifiers that account for unsafe place of discharge which could be added to claims after the impact of a natural disaster.\n proposal: cms previously established policies beginning with performance year 2017 and every year that follows, for using an alternative approach to calculate acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cost and quality performance if deemed affected by an \u00e2\u0080\u009cextreme and uncontrollable circumstance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms seeks feedback on this policy.\n comments: we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughtful analysis and proposals related to accounting for the impact of a natural disaster on an impacted aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shared losses and quality. cms proposes a more aggressive transition to risk. therefore, these policies are even more critical to protect acos unfairly harmed by expenses and quality changes beyond their control as a result of a natural disaster. as acos have been impacted by several natural disasters in recent years, more data are available to deeply analyze the effect of such extreme and uncontrollable circumstances on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n introducing such policies, acos have had more experiences with natural disasters and therefore experience with how such events affect an aco. based on this experience, we recommend several changes to the current extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy.\n trend rate without changes to the current policy, natural disasters will negatively affect mssp acos and therefore affect the long-term sustainability of the program and the medicare trust fund. the current policy prorates shared losses by multiplying the shared losses by two factors: the percentage of the total months in the performance year affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance and the beneficiaries who reside in an area affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance. this adequately addresses acos that are expected to have shared losses based on performance prior to a natural disaster and have increased shared losses after a natural disaster. however, the current policy does not address an increase in annual per capital expense as compared to the benchmark/msr/mlr. this point is particularly sensitive around msr and mlr values where very small changes can have large or 100 percent impact on shared savings or shared losses when either the msr or mlr is exceeded.\n the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current policy relies on \u00e2\u0080\u009cuse of natural disaster payment modifiers\u00e2\u0080\u009d to allow mssp acos to identify whether a claim would have been denied under normal medicare ffs rules. there is no evidence to support that part a providers were or are aware of such natural disaster codes or were using them compliantly. additionally, there is no policy to use them to account for unsafe place of discharge which creates a longer length of stay. we believe that there is a current disparity between cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectation of compliance with disaster payment modifiers and the current use of such codes (see additional comments below regarding use of natural disaster codes). due to these limitations of the current policy, we instead recommend that cms revise the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy to provide a trend/growth rate that is the higher of the national assignable rate or the regional rate. further, the regional rate should be calculated by excluding the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries. studies have shown that natural disaster materially increase medicare costs per beneficiary. for example a recent article, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisaster impacts on cost and utilization of medicare\u00e2\u0080\u009d shows annual standardized cost per beneficiary increased\n7.6% from the mean in the counties most severely impacted by these events (see table 1).  \n\n quality performance scores natural disasters can have a significant negative impact on both aco process and outcomes measure scores. as an example, for process measures it is not uncommon during a disaster for scheduled annual wellness visits to be canceled due either to clinic closure or beneficiary evacuation. in some instances, these visits aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t subsequently rescheduled which leads to missed opportunities to provide preventative care and identify emerging issues that require care coordination. the current cms policy awards an average quality score to those affected by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, which can unfairly penalize high performing acos. instead we recommend cms should use an approach similar to the policy currently used in the ma program and award a quality score that is the greater of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality score for the affected performance year, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prior year quality score, or the national mean quality score. for acos that are in their first year, cms should award a quality score that is the greater of their actual quality score for the affected performance year or the national mean quality score. we also strongly recommend cms expand its policy related to aco quality scores negatively affected by a natural disaster to include all acos, not just those who cannot report quality data. we believe that acos whose scores on either the all-cause readmissions measure (aco-8) or the snf readmissions measure (aco-35) fall below the 30th percentile should be eligible to have their quality score adjusted to account for the natural disaster.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n additionally, the codes do not allow for capturing instances of \u00e2\u0080\u0098unsafe place of discharge\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which is common during a natural disaster. furthermore, the timing of the claims submission during a natural disaster does not lend itself to accurate use of the modifiers. at the time of an extreme event or natural disaster, a facility is working tirelessly to address the patient surge, to transfer patients who have clinical needs that cannot be met under emergency operating conditions, and to meet a myriad of other community needs. training health system providers to use these codes is not common. given the infrequent nature of these events providers focus their scarce training resources for revenue cycle staff to remain in compliance with medicare and medicaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever-evolving billing regulations. therefore, at a time when providers are pushed beyond capacity to manage patient care during emergencies, there is no routine revenue cycle workflow to ensure the disaster modifiers are accurately assigned. only in instances where a biller knows a claim is out of compliance for payment may the workflow to add the code be triggered. therefore, we feel the definition of these modifiers must be expanded or new natural disaster payment modifiers should be created with proper education to help isolate the extreme or uncontrollable events by claim or beneficiary during a natural disaster. naacos feels this would be a more accurate approach to analyzing impacts of extreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster.\n conclusion\n acos have been instrumental in the shift to value-based care and a central part of the aco concept is to transform healthcare through meaningful clinical and operational changes to put patients first by improving their care and reducing unnecessary expenditures. the mssp remains a voluntary program, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to have the right balance of risk and reward to continue program growth and success. program changes that deter new entrants would shut off a pipeline of beginner acos that should be encouraged to embark on the journey to value, which is a long- standing bipartisan goal of the administration and congress and important aspect of the qpp. we urge the agency to consider the feedback presented from the aco community outlined in this letter. thank you for your consideration of our comments.\n sincerely,\n\n\n", "0387": "justice

accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success\n justice in aging appreciates the opportunity to comment on the above referenced notice of proposed rulemaking (nprm) on the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and accountable care organizations (acos). justice in aging is an advocacy organization with the mission of improving the lives of low-income older adults. we use the power of law to fight senior poverty by securing access to affordable health care, economic security and the courts for older adults with limited resources. we have decades of experience with medicare and medicaid, with a focus on the needs of low-income beneficiaries and populations that have traditionally lacked legal protection such as women, people of color, lgbt individuals, and people with limited english proficiency. as consumer advocates, our comments focus on recommendations for ensuring medicare fee-for- service (ffs) beneficiaries have access to high quality care through the mssp and that acos can continue to innovate to better serve high-needs populations while maintaining strong consumer protections.\ni. redesigning participation options to facilitate transition to performance-based risk \n 2\n coordinated care. data show acos have improved the quality of patient care. a 2017 health and human services office of inspector general report found that acos achieved demonstrably higher quality compared to fee-for-service providers not in acos and, in particular, noted progress on important measures such as reduced hospital readmissions and screening beneficiaries for risk of falling and depression.1 in 2016, 99% of the 438 track 1 acos met quality standards, according to the medicare payment advisory commission. moreover, according to cms, acos with four or more years of experience improved their average quality performance by 15% between 2013 and 2016. early analysis of consumer assessment of healthcare providers and systems (cahps) survey data show patients reported improvements in timely access to care and other aspects of care. independent analysis and cms data also show acos are helping reduce growth in medicare spending. by cms estimates in 2017, 472 mssp acos caring for 9 million beneficiaries generated gross savings of $1.1 billion and netted $314 million in savings to the medicare trust fund.2  this is consistent with independent research.3 the proposed rule estimates the overall impact of acos, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cspillover effects\u00e2\u0080\u009d on medicare spending outside of the aco program, lowered spending by $1.8 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $4.2 billion (0.5 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1.2%) in 2016 alone. in light of the demonstrated benefits of acos to medicare beneficiaries and the demonstrated savings for the medicare trust fund, we are very concerned about the cms proposal to shorten the time new acos have in a shared savings-only model from six to two years and to cut in half the shared savings rates for these acos from 50% to 25%. as the mssp is a voluntary program, it must have the right balance of risk and reward to continue to grow and succeed. we are concerned that these proposed changes do not achieve that balance and would deter new acos from entering and thereby effectively end the program. therefore, we request that cms not finalize these changes as proposed and instead allow more time for acos in a shared savings-only model and to apply a shared savings rate of at least 50%. we believe these changes are necessary for the sustainability of the program.\nii. beneficiary incentive programs \n we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to prohibit acos from advertising beneficiary incentive programs. such programs that offer cash or in-kind benefits like gym memberships, if allowed to be advertised to beneficiaries who are not already receiving care from the aco, could improperly\n 1hhs office of inspector general, medicare shared savings program

\n\n 3\n influence individuals to choose a provider in the aco for the incentive rather than based on their care needs. we also recommend that cms evaluate the expanded beneficiary incentive program prior to the statutorily required date of 2023. given that it is subject to abuse and may have unintended negative consequences, cms should use its authority to adjust the program and/or notify congress of the need to change or eliminate it as soon as the need can be assessed.\niii. empowering beneficiary choice--beneficiary notices \n 4\n as cms develops the proposed template notice, including the step-by-step instructions for beneficiaries to designate a primary care provider on mymedicare.gov, we urge cms to engage beneficiaries and other consumer stakeholders throughout the process and thoroughly test the notice with beneficiaries prior to finalizing it. as explained more fully below, we also urge cms to translate this notice so that beneficiaries with limited english proficiency are also adequately informed. the notice must also be accessible in other formats for beneficiaries with visual impairments or other disabilities. we are also concerned that the notice at the point of service is only required in english and that the more comprehensive written information available upon request is only translated in spanish. for beneficiaries with limited english proficiency, an english-only notice is not sufficient. therefore, we recommend translating such important information into at least the thirteen languages used in the medicare multi-language insert and requiring that acos inform beneficiaries that more information is available in those languages. moreover, cms cites the medicare & you handbook as an important source of beneficiary information about acos. however, medicare & you is also not translated into a sufficient number of languages. this means many non-english speaking beneficiaries have no means of receiving this information in their primary language. conclusion thank you for considering our comments. if any questions arise concerning this submission, please contact me at jgoldberg@justiceinaging.org. sincerely,\n jennifer

of memorialcare, a nonprofit, fully-integrated health care delivery system located in southern california that includes four hospitals with 11,000 employees and 2,550 medical staff physicians, we appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) proposed rule outlining changes to the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\n background: memorialcare is an advocate of value-based care and has continued to increase the number and variety of value-based contracts to multiple populations of patients. our medical group and independent physician association (ipa) have several decades of experience accepting capitated risk for the management of both medicare advantage (ma) and commercial hmo patients. more recently, we participated in the centers for medicare and medicaid innovation next generation accountable care organization (aco). in addition, we have experience in commercial acos, including several with aetna and anthem, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve added our newest offering in 2017, a direct-to-employer agreement for accountable care with the boeing company. our system has successfully approached these value- based delivery innovations through a unique collaborative effort with the physicians of our physician society, an association of over 1900 affiliated community primary care and specialist providers committed to evidence-based care, and our medical foundation (mcmf), which is affiliated with memorialcare medical group (mcmg) and greater newport physicians, a multi-specialty ipa. in addition, we have intentionally focused our expansion on medical offices and clinics, and outpatient access points, including ambulatory surgery centers, free-standing imaging facilities and dialysis centers.  memorialcare looks forward to continuing these efforts as health care steadily moves to improve systems that reward value and outcomes.\n\n 2\n things to consider: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 please consider new payment models in the future, including the america\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physician groups proposed third option. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 provide more ramp up time for next generation aco participants. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 expand access to the 3-day waiver for skilled-nursing facility and telehealth coverage under the mssp program\n\n new model: third option - proposed by apg: memorialcare supports apg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed \u00e2\u0080\u009cthird option\u00e2\u0080\u009d a new direct contract model that features capitated payments to physician organizations.  at the core of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cthird option\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the formation of physician-led, clinically integrated organizations (cios). a cio is made up of participating physician group practices that provide both primary and specialty care to patients in traditional medicare.  it features prospective population payments to physician organizations that include robust quality measurements with active beneficiary engagement.\n the model would allow cms to directly contract with cios. the cios may be existing physician organizations or newly formed entities. the cio would be explicitly physician group centric, however, other providers could take ownership stakes, or could accept a measure of risk and accountability through affiliation agreements.\n in order to participate in this model, cios would have to meet current cms and state requirements, similar to those required for existing medicare accountable care organization (aco) participants such as a formal legal structure that allows the organization to receive capitated payment and pay contracted or employed providers. while at the same time, the model provides for the active enrollment by beneficiaries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a design element critical to the goal of achieving the full beneficiary engagement.\n cms would establish capitation rates including the standard medicare part a and part b benefits, using methods and benchmarks similar to those used to establish rates for medicare advantage (ma) plans. the payments would be actuarially sound, risk adjusted, and updated annually. cms would pre-pay this amount to the cio each month in lieu of medicare part a and part b fee for service (ffs) payments for enrolled beneficiaries, and the cio would then be responsible for the payment for all professional and hospital services, whether provided in-network or out-of-network.\n beneficiaries would be encouraged to stay in network by differential copayments and coinsurance, paying higher copayments for going out of the cios contracted or employed network, and lower or no copayments for services received in-network. medicare supplement benefits would only be payable for services in network. in addition, there would be robust publicly reported quality and efficiency measures similar to the ma stars rating and could be used to make comparisons between the cios and\nffs.   \n\n 3\n cms would contract with one or more affiliated service organizations (asos) to provide a full range of necessary administrative services, including quality and data reporting, payment, financial and patient cost sharing tracking, enrollment, and all other back office functions. these asos would serve as fiscal and administrative intermediaries similar to those currently engaged by cms and by self-insured employers.\n the third option allows participating clinicians to better coordinate services and practice patient- centered medical care tailored to each individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s specific needs. the tools available in this new model not only keep costs in check but, more importantly, truly improve patient care and outcomes for our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seniors.\n memorialcare and next generation aco: we continue to advocate to issues we raised with the next generation aco model including attribution methodologies, stop loss and risk calculations. we met with cmmi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team several times in 2017 to review our concerns about the current modeling which adversely impacted our organization despite an overall positive performance on raw costs of care, and impacted a number of other programs in california.  based on these concerns, we did not reapply in 2018 to participate in the next generation aco.\n however, based on our experience we suggest program consideration should be given for allowing a \u00e2\u0080\u009cramp up\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a no-risk period (e.g. 6-12 months) and/or the option to extend the return of investment (roi) from 12 to 24 months.  this would enable the aco to have an effective period of time to establish coordinated care for all high and rising risk patients and to allow for beneficiary engagement and data/claims flow before risk-sharing begins.\n guiding principle: support removal of legal and regulatory barriers to clinical integration, as well as modifications and waivers to medicare policies that deny hospitals the flexibility to provide the most efficient and clinically appropriate care: memorialcare applauds the administration for the work to date under its patient over paperwork initiative and its active solicitation of stakeholder feedback in changes needed to both the stark and anti-kickback laws through two separate requests for information. we urge the agency to continue to find additional opportunities under the mssp program to remove unnecessary barriers in care delivery and in care transitions. both federal and california state law create serious barriers to clinical integration, which is essential to creating efficiencies and improving care under alternative payment models. clinical integration depends on hospitals, doctors, nurses and other caregivers working as a team to ensure that patients get the right care, at the right time, in the right place. shared savings and gainsharing provide important mechanisms for aligning providers' interests to decrease health care costs while improving quality, as the health care industry transitions from volume- to value-based payment.\n\n 4\n therefore, we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposals to expand access to the 3-day waiver for skilled-nursing facility and telehealth coverage under the mssp program. memorialcare urges cms to look for additional opportunities to further streamline care delivery for our beneficiaries. in california, state law poses a significant challenge to aligning incentives, therefore it is incredibly important to ensure federal flexibility. the cost of doing business is increased by the need for complex business agreements in order to appropriately navigate a complex regulatory framework. these costs should be avoided.\n thank you for the

3\nwww.hcttf.org \n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the measure of aco success should incorporate a formal program evaluation. there is much discussion about the most accurate way to measure individual mssp participant performance and overall program impact. cms analysis presented in the proposed rule also finds that mssp acos produce significant net savings when considering claims data beyond the benchmark, including spillover effects on related populations and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeedback effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d of wider aco participation in lowering ffs trend and subsequent benchmarks. several independent evaluations using cms data also indicate that the relative-to-benchmark method for evaluating program performance underestimates true savings to the medicare program. statistical analysis by harvard researchers used control groups to determine net savings to medicare from the mssp program in 2015 ($256.4 million) was nearly 2.8 times greater than the amount reported by cms using only benchmark comparisons ($92.3 million).1 while the aco benchmark methodology may be appropriate for policy purposes, for purposes of evaluating impact on the trust fund, it is important to incorporate a broader set of measurement approaches to determine overall impact on spending for non-aco assigned medicare ffs beneficiaries and medicare advantage expenditures. the propose rule seeks to improve the long-term success and sustainability of mssp by creating a pathway for acos to more rapidly transition to performance-based risk. the greatest potential savings to medicare will come from acos reducing claims-based medical cost. current data shows that these medical costs are being reduced in all types of acos, which is a positive trend. however, the greatest potential for program savings is likely to be achieved when more acos move to performance-based risk. thus, the program will only realize its maximum net savings potential if cms finalizes policy that encourages broad participation in this voluntary program and properly aligns incentives to inspire participants to advance along the risk continuum. we offer recommendations below to advance these important objectives.\nii. participation options \n the task force has long supported the creation of new two-sided risk models that would provide an intermediate step along the continuum to fully mature two-sided risk models for both hospital and physician-led acos. for this reason, we supported cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s track 1+ aco model to assist mssp track 1 acos in the transition to advanced apms. if structured appropriately, the new participation options could provide a desirable glide path to participation in models with higher levels of performance-based risk.\na. basic track glidepath \n the real potential of the aco program depends on both the breadth of participation as well as the financial incentives to control costs while improving quality of care. we are supportive of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intent to reduce the time allowed for acos to remain in upside-only payment arrangements, but we believe that upside-only payment arrangements serve an important function as a transitional state on the path to full-risk models that allow providers to become familiar with program requirements and managing risk.\n\n 4\nwww.hcttf.org \n as proposed, however, the basic track falls short of creating an attractive path for providers to voluntarily follow given the level of investment required to stand up and operate an aco. cms has proposed a maximum financial upside rate of 25 percent for the first two performance levels of the basic track, increasing to 30 percent, 40 percent, and 50 percent shared savings rates with increasing levels of risk. our provider members strongly believe that a 25 percent shared savings rate in the first two years will be a barrier to entry for new acos because the investment costs alone would outweigh any potential return. further, the task force has previously shared our perspective with cms that a 50 percent shared savings rate may not provide sufficient incentive for providers to take on higher levels of risk (given the challenges around predictability, transparency and simplicity of the financial model as described above) or to invest in the delivery reforms necessary to succeed in a performance-based risk model. the shared savings rates as proposed will be a major deterrent for keeping existing acos in the program and encouraging all participants to invest in practice transformation. therefore, we urge cms to set the entry-level shared savings rate for the basic track at 50 percent with higher shared savings rates for levels with performance-based risk. it is critical to create a feasible business case for new entrants to transition away from fee-for-service by setting a reasonable potential upside rate, while increasing the reward as risk increases. as noted in the next subsection, this step-up approach at these levels of shared savings also has the potential to create greater consistency for acos to move from the basic to the enhanced track.\nb. enhanced track glidepath \n as proposed, some acos would not be eligible to enter the basic track or to renew for a second agreement period, and would instead have the option of enrolling in the enhanced track. the difference in risk level from the basic level e to enhanced track is significant. cms should either build a glide path to the highest risk level within the enhanced track or offer an additional track to help bridge the gap. if cms finalizes the proposed distinct options for high-revenue versus low-revenue acos (discussed further below), we believe an enhanced glidepath could encourage more high-revenue acos to join the program that would otherwise drop out. to maximize interest in moving to the enhanced track, cms should start the shared savings rate in line with the shared savings rate for the next generation aco program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk arrangement a (80 percent).\nc. full track option \n\n 5\nwww.hcttf.org \n a number of next gen acos started their journey as track 1 mssp acos, which demonstrates the importance of cms creating a comprehensive glidepath to risk.\nd. differentiate participation options based on aco performance \n the proposed rule offers distinct participation options for new and renewing acos based on the broad categories of total part a and b ffs revenue and prior experience with performance-based risk. cms offers justification for this differentiation that high-revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which typically include a hospital \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are more capable of controlling the total expenditures of its assigned beneficiaries. this proposal would create unnecessary complexity and disincentive hospital-led aco participation. the hcttf does not support distinct participation options for high-revenue versus low-revenue acos as proposed. the objective of the medicare shared savings program is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients. the best way to drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including hospitals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to collaborate to innovate and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare. the task force recommends an alternate distinction based on actual aco performance over time. the 2017 mssp results confirm that aco performance improves with longer participation in the program. for acos inexperienced with risk, the early years of aco participation require significant investment in system change and a steep learning curve; the returns on that investment risk are realized over the lifetime of the aco, not necessarily the first or second year of the performance period. providing a longer window for successful acos to continue in the program and achieve a reasonable return on their investment will encourage broader upfront adoption, incentivize better performance, and encourage greater long-term returns by retaining high performers. therefore, cms should institute gatekeeping mechanisms to ensure that acos meeting set cost and quality goals can continue participation within an mssp track. the proposed rule already lays out a much more aggressive policy for early termination of acos with expenditures exceeding the minimum loss ratio for two years. we agree that acos that are unable to succeed under a risk-based arrangement should not be permitted to remain in the program. however, the task force encourages an extended observation period to assess aco performance for at least three years \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and consider improvements over time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 before limiting participation options. under the current reporting cycle timeline, acos are not informed of their performance until october of the following year. a critical component of performance improvement lies in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to analyze the performance data being provided to the aco and make targeted improvements based on this information. at least three performance years would be needed to collect two years of completed performance data on which to base that assessment. for current acos that have at least three years of participation experience, cms could use existing performance data to make a determination.\ne. mandatory progression \n\n 6\nwww.hcttf.org \n we do not support that proposal, we similarly believe that the mandatory progression proposal should not be finalized.\niii. benchmarking refinements \n\n\na. risk adjustment \n cms has proposed modifications to the risk adjustment methodology to account for changes in case mix and severity of assigned beneficiaries and to eliminate the distinction between continuously and newly aligned beneficiaries, which is a step in the right direction. however, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to cap the risk score growth at +/-3 percent seems arbitrary without supporting data. further, by capping the growth in risk scores for a defined attributed population, risk adjustment in performance benchmarks is not reflective of the population a provider is managing year to year. this discrepancy can contribute to adverse incentives for program participants and encourage cherry-picking. alternatively, cms should focus on bringing more consistency to the risk scoring approaches across medicare apms and medicare advantage.\nb. regional factors \n cms proposes to incorporate regional factors when establishing the benchmark as part of the first agreement period, as well as for updating the benchmark. we recommend that cms maintain the cap on the regional adjustment at 70% percent. we also encourage cms to remove aco beneficiaries from the regional comparison group; including aco beneficiaries in the comparison defeats the purpose of accounting for non-aco regional expenditure trend.  these changes will help create a stronger business investment case within a financial model that is often complex, opaque and unpredictable.\niv. program policies \n the task force is generally supportive of the refined program policies as proposed, including the additional certainty and predictability provided by 5-year agreement periods; annual participation elections for retrospective or prospective beneficiary alignment; enhanced beneficiary engagement options; and expanded access for all two-sided acos to payment rule waivers. we recommend cms consider modifications to the following policies as proposed.\na. offer 12-month extension to current acos \n cms should allow existing acos that would be qualified for the 6-month extension to instead extend for a full year. prorating the performance period benchmark would introduce numerous complications for measuring performance. for example, medicare expenditures demonstrate strong and well-known seasonality which would skew performance results when comparing performance from the first six months of the calendar year against a prorated benchmark which represents an annual average. also, the change in beneficiary assignment methodology mid-year could present issues related to managing two different populations.\nb. beneficiary assignment methodology \n\n 7\nwww.hcttf.org \n assignment to those who choose to opt-in, or those who are chronically ill.  we are very concerned that the seven claims per year threshold is too low and would leave out a large portion of medicare beneficiaries from the program. we encourage cms focus on implementing the new voluntary alignment provisions this year and further research the implications of such a hybrid approach before implementing.\nc. early termination  \n as noted above, the task force supports the proposal to allow cms to terminate an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement immediately or with advanced notice if the aco is negatively outside the mlr corridor, but recommend cms extend the period of review to 3 performance years as well as consider evidence of improvement over time before making a determination to terminate an aco.\nd. overlap with other apms including cpc+ \n various alternative payment models \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including population-based payment models, episodes of care, and advanced primary care models \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when deployed in coordination can have a positive synergistic impact on care for medicare beneficiaries. the hcttf has offered cms recommendations for providing apm participants adequate flexibility to manage model overlap based on their unique market situation in a way that encourages greater alignment and ultimately drives better outcomes for patients.2 it is therefore notable that the proposed rule does not address the longstanding policy for comprehensive primary care plus (cpc+) practices participating in acos. the cpc+ model meets a critical gap in advanced primary care payment models, which incorporates care management fees and performance-based incentive payments. the new care management fees are accounted for as aco expenditures but are not accounted for in the historical cost base for an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark for five years, which harms the acos participating in transforming primary care practices. cms should discount the cpc+ care management fees from aco benchmarks to encourage primary care investment and coordination with acos, until those costs are fully incorporated into the baseline and therefore the benchmark.\ne. waiver applicability \n through existing waivers, aco participants have been able to better meet the needs of individual patients in a variety of innovative ways. however, providers are understandably cautious to utilize waivers when applicability is unclear. our members report uncertainty around the availability of particular waivers due to limited commentary about cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intended scope or applicability for particular aco participants. given that waivers are currently available on an opt-in basis, this uncertainty has led some stakeholders to decline the opportunity out of fear of noncompliance if they implement a waiver incorrectly. with the expanded availability of waivers under the proposed rule, we urge cms to expedite and regularly update frequently asked questions guidance documents and/or commentaries in response to recurrent questions regarding common provider circumstances. cms and the office of the inspector general should also explore mechanisms for providers to ask questions for guidance about the waivers short of a traditional advisory opinion. *****\n\n 8\nwww.hcttf.org \n if you have questions or follow up needs, please contact hcttf executive director jeff micklos

shared savings rates below 50 percent, reduce the time in a shared savings-only model, and introduce early termination policies based on spending that is slightly higher than benchmarks. i urge cms to modify the proposed application of a +/- 3 percent risk adjustment cap across an extended agreement period by increasing that to +/- 5 percent.\r\n\r\non the other hand, i support a number of proposals in the rule and encourage cms to finalize its proposals to: 1) move to five-year agreement periods; 2) introduce a more gradual glidepath to risk; 3) reduce burdens related to quality reporting; 4) eliminate the distinction between new and continuously assigned beneficiaries for risk adjustment, 5) expand the use of waivers for telehealth and skilled nursing facility stays; and 6) provide flexibility with choosing assignment methodology.\r\n\r\ni would also like to voice my support for the detailed comments submitted by the national association of acos (naacos) and call out the following recommendations.\r\nnot require any acos to participate in the enhanced track but keep that a voluntary model for acos prepared for higher levels of risk and reward. the enhanced track does not include a revenue-based loss sharing limit, and we urge the agency to create one. it is essential that cms revise its policies to keep the enhanced track voluntary.\r\nnot cut the shared savings rates and apply the following shared savings rates: 50 percent for basic levels a and b, 55 percent for basic levels c and d, and 60 percent for basic level e. naacos members report spending almost $2 million a year, on average for mssp participation, including investments in health information technology, population health management and aco administration. this reduction in shared savings will not allow acos to recoup those investments.\r\nfinalize policies that support the move to regional benchmarking but maintain the current maximum of 70 percent regional expenditures rather than capping at 50 percent.\r\nnot finalize the arbitrary distinction of high- and low-revenue acos. we oppose requirements that high-revenue acos be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e. in the proposed rule, cms states that acos whose participants have greater total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue, relative to their benchmarks, have more ability to control costs and may be better financially prepared to move to greater levels of risk. being high or low revenue does not determine when an aco is ready for risk. regardless of structure, significant investments are needed in population health platforms and care process changes to bear risk. the challenge of being forced into risk is of great importance to acos of all sizes, composition, and ownership. it makes more sense to lower the required amount of risk for both high and low revenue acos rather than treat them differently.\r\nnot finalize the proposal to establish a june 30th deadline to voluntarily terminate aco participation agreements and still hold acos accountable for all shared losses if terminating after this date. acos would not have the data they need to make an informed choice about their continued participation in the program by june 30th. further, we are concerned with cmss proposal to hold acos accountable for a prorated amount of shared losses when voluntarily terminating from the program prior to june 30th and holding acos accountable for all shared losses when voluntarily terminating from the program after june 30th. we recommend cms not prorate shared losses as proposed. should cms finalize changes to the current policy, we urge you to instead hold acos accountable for prorated shared losses only for acos choosing to terminate after the voluntary termination deadline.\r\nwe urge cms to exclude mips bonuses from aco expenditures. the current policy punishes acos for their high performance by requiring track 1 acos to participate in mips, excluding such acos from advanced apm bonuses and counting any mips bonuses earned in that program as aco expenditures. cms currently excludes advanced apm bonuses from aco expenditures and we would like to see the same practice for mips expenditures.\r\n\r\nthe mssp remains a voluntary program, and its essential to have the right balance of risk and reward to continue program growth and success. thank you for consideration of my

director for a track 1 accountable care organization (aco), i wanted to share my views with you regarding the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) proposed \"pathways to success\" rule on the medicare shared savings program.\ni write in opposition to a few key aspects of the recent proposed rule, in particular the agency's proposal to cut accountable care organizations' (acos') shared savings rates below 50 percent, reduce the time in a shared savings-only model from six to two years, and introduce early termination policies based on spending that is slightly higher than benchmarks. i urge cms to modify the proposed application of a +/- 3 percent risk adjustment cap across an extended agreement period by increasing that to +/- 5 percent. these proposed changes will harm patients and providers by limiting improvements in savings and quality acos provide, while slowing progress made in transitioning to value-base payments.\non the other hand, i support a number of proposals in the rule and encourage cms to finalize its proposals to: 1) move to five-year agreement periods; 2) introduce a more gradual glidepath to risk and make the track 1+ equivalent (basic level e) permanent; 3) reduce burdens related to quality reporting; 4) elimination of the distinction between new and continuously assigned beneficiaries for risk adjustment, 5)expand the use of waivers for telehealth and skilled nursing facility stays; and 6) provide flexibility with choosing assignment methodology regardless of risk model.\ni would also like to voice my support for the detailed comments and recommendations submitted by the national association of acos (naacos) and call out the following recommendations.\nnot require any acos to participate in the enhanced track but keep that a voluntary model for acos prepared for higher levels of risk and reward.  the enhanced track does not include a revenue-based loss sharing limit, and we urge the agency to create one and to create more options for gradual risk increases between basic level e and the enhanced track. it is also essential that cms revise its policies to keep the enhanced track voluntary, as with track 3, and not attempt to push acos into a model with levels of risk they are unprepared to assume.\nnot cut, in half, the shared savings rates for shared savings-only acos and to apply the following shared savings rates: 50 percent for basic levels a and b, 55 percent for basic levels c and d, and 60 percent for basic level e.  naacos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 members report spending almost $2 million a year, on average for mssp participation, including investments made in health information technology, population health management and aco administration. such a drastic reduction in shared savings payments will not allow acos to recoup those investments and deter future participation in such a needed value-based payment program like mssp.\nupdate the risk adjustment methodology by allowing risk scores to change by +/-5 percent over an agreement, as opposed to the proposed +/-3 percent range, and to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries.  it is unreasonable to assume a provider organization, however effective, can manage a population such that patient conditions never worsen over time and it never carries a higher disease burden. therefore, we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to eliminate the newly and continuously assigned beneficiary categories and recommend additional changes to the risk adjustment proposals.\nfinalize policies that support the move to regional benchmarking, including maintaining the current maximum of 70 percent regional expenditures.  as cms gradually introduces regional expenditures, for third and subsequent agreement periods, we urge the agency not to finalize its proposal to cap regional expenditures at 50 percent. this is a decrease from the current policy of applying a maximum of 70 percent regional expenditure data. this policy was finalized two years ago and given the phase-in schedule of regional expenditure data, acos have not yet reached this level so it is premature to reverse this policy.\nnot finalize the arbitrary distinction of high- and low-revenue acos.  we oppose requirements that high-revenue acos, or any aco, be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e.  in the proposed rule, cms states its belief that acos whose participants have greater total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue relative to their benchmarks have more ability to control costs and may be better financially prepared to move to greater levels of risk.  being \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009clow\u00e2\u0080\u009d revenue does not determine when an aco is ready for risk or how much risk they are able to assume. regardless of structure, significant investments are needed in population health platforms and care process changes for acos to bear risk.  the challenge of being forced into risk is of great importance to acos of all sizes, composition, and ownership. it makes more sense to lower the required amount of risk for both high and low revenue acos rather than treat them differently.\nnot finalize the proposal to permit cms to terminate an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement if expenditures exceed a certain amount after two performance periods.  we have concerns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to exercise the option to terminate an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement if the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expenditures for the assigned beneficiary population exceed the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark by an amount equal to or exceeding either the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative msr under a one-sided model or the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mlr under a two-sided model after two performance years.  this policy may have the unintended consequence of removing well intentioned acos from the program who might otherwise go on to achieve savings and make quality improvements for their patients.  there may be a number of valid reasons why an aco may have spending that is slightly higher than its benchmark for a performance year.  for example, the beneficiary population could experience a worse than usual flu season, increased spending could be based on new care management fees, or the aco could have performed well in the merit-based incentive payment system (mips) and earned a mips bonus which cms includes as an aco expenditure.\nnot finalize the proposal to establish a june 30 deadline to voluntarily terminate aco participation agreements and still hold acos accountable for all shared losses if terminating after this date.  acos would not have the data they need to make an informed choice about their continued participation in the program by june 30. that data would not be available until later in the year due to the timing of distributing performance reports. acos should have three quarters of experience available to them to make a decision about their continued participation in the program. further, we are very concerned with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to hold acos accountable for a prorated amount of shared losses when voluntarily terminating from the program prior to june 30 and holding acos accountable for all shared losses when voluntarily terminating from the program after june 30. this is a departure from the current standards, and we recommend cms not prorate shared losses as proposed. should cms finalize changes to the current policy, we urge the agency to instead hold acos accountable for prorated shared losses only for acos choosing to terminate after the established voluntary termination deadline.\nwe urge cms to exclude mips bonuses from aco expenditures. the current cms policy unfairly punishes acos for their high performance by both requiring track 1 acos (and basic levels a, b, c and d as proposed) to participate in mips, excluding such acos from advanced apm bonuses and counting any mips bonuses earned for high performance in that program as aco expenditures. cms currently excludes advanced apm bonuses from aco expenditures and we would like to see the same practice for mips expenditures.\nfinalize proposals to expand eligibility for the skilled nursing facility (snf) three-day rule and telehealth waivers, while considering additional waivers for acos finalize proposals to introduce a beneficiary incentive program for mssp acos\nfinalize the proposal to remove aco quality measure 11 and instead rely on attestation to evaluate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of certified electronic health record technology (cehrt), while also excluding acos subject to the merit-based incentive payment system (mips) from promoting interoperability requirements.\nacos have been instrumental in the shift to value-based care and a central part of the aco concept is to transform healthcare through meaningful clinical and operational changes to put patients first by improving their care and reducing unnecessary expenditures.  the mssp remains a voluntary program, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to have the right balance of risk and reward to continue program growth and success. thank you for consideration of my comments and for your work on behalf of patients and providers to advance value-based payment. we appreciate your interest in sustaining the success of medicare acos and creating an environment where providers are encouraged to enter into value-based payment arrangements and help

verma:\n i am submitting this comment letter on behalf of beth israel deaconess care organization (bidco) in response to cms-1701-p: medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success.  bidco is a value-based physician and hospital network and an accountable care organization (aco) made up of more than 2,700 physicians and eight hospitals in eastern massachusetts.  bidco is an early adopter of merging global budget accountability with the delivery of high-quality care; we contracted with the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) as a pioneer aco, and currently participate in track 3 of the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\n bidco appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed revisions to mssp and applauds the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to advance the transition to value-based care through the administration of this program.  our organization supports many of the suggested changes, as noted in further detail below, including the extension of the contract term to five years and the removal of aco-11.  bidco also has concerns about the implementation of a number of proposals, particularly the limitation of time in one-sided risk and the risk-sharing percentages in those levels. bidco makes a number of suggestions to address those concerns.\n summary of key recommendations as detailed in the comments below, in the final pathways to success rule we urge the agency to:\n1. restructure the mssp with the proposed basic and enhanced tracks which includes a \n more gradual ramp up of risk in the basic track than currently available and permanent inclusion of basic level e (currently track 1+)\n2. finalize the proposal to enact extended, five-year agreement

recommendations\n\n1. replacing current tracks with basic and enhanced tracks \n\n key comments: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco supports restructuring the mssp with the proposed basic and enhanced tracks, which includes a more gradual ramp up of risk in the basic track than currently available. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco applauds the permanent inclusion of track 1+ (renamed basic level e). \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco urges cms to introduce a glide path to higher risk between basic level e and the enhanced track and to not require participation in the enhanced track but provide it as a voluntary option for acos ready for higher levels of risk and reward.\n proposals: cms proposes that effective june 30, 2019 the agency would retire the current mssp tracks 1, 1+, 2 and 3 and would replace those with new basic (including levels a through e) and enhanced tracks effective with a transition to the new tracks beginning july 1, 2019. while there are a number of overall program changes, the new tracks and levels have overall similarities to most of the existing tracks, such that they are roughly equivalent as follows:\n current mssp track equivalent under proposed mssp structure track 1 basic level a and b track 1+ basic level e track 2 no equivalent track 3 enhanced track\n comments:\n renaming and restructuring the mssp\n we support the transition to the new basic and enhanced tracks, especially with the introduction of a more gradual glide path to assuming risk in the basic track. this allows acos to gain exposure to risk in a more incremental manner than what is currently available in the mssp. we strongly support the permanent inclusion of the track 1+ equivalent, basic level e, which is an important option for acos assuming downside financial risk and allows loss sharing limits similar to those required for advanced apms in the quality payment program (qpp). that said, we have a number of concerns with the specific shared savings and loss rates included in the revised mssp, which are discussed in detail in later sections of this comment letter. the basic and enhanced track labels are more descriptive than the current labels for the existing mssp tracks. we recommend that should these name changes be finalized, that they stay in place moving forward to ensure continuity and understanding across the industry.\n moving from level e to the enhanced track\n\n\n\n\n\n 4\n only a very small group of acos have chosen to participate. while the proposed rule provides some changes to the enhanced track, which also apply to other downside financial risk models in the basic track, there remains a massive jump in risk from basic level e and the enhanced track, with the latter requiring maximum losses based on total cost of care and capped at almost four times those in the basic level e. cms acknowledges this significant increase and requests feedback, stating on page 41818:\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe recognize that the difference in the level of risk and potential reward under the basic track, level e compared to the payment model under the enhanced track could be substantial for low revenue acos. therefore, we also considered and seek comment on an approach that would allow low revenue acos to gradually transition from the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level e up to the level of risk and potential reward under the enhanced track. for example, we seek comment on whether it would be helpful to devise a glide path that would be available to low revenue acos entering the enhanced track. we also considered, and seek comment on, whether such a glide path under the enhanced track should be available to all acos. as another alternative, we considered allowing low revenue acos to continue to participate in the basic track under level e for longer periods of time, such as a third or subsequent agreement period. however, we believe that without a time limitation on participation in the basic track, acos may not prepare to take on the highest level of risk that could drive the most meaningful change in providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099/suppliers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior toward achieving the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n establishing an aco and embarking on the related transformations inherent in population health are what drives changes in provider behavior. these changes often take years to generate results, as evidenced by the increasingly positive results for acos that are in the program for a longer period of time. we point to august 2017 findings from the department of health and human services inspector general (oig) and 2017 mssp results available in the public use file as proof that acos need time to generate positive results and demonstrate change. therefore, we have concerns with the assertion that high levels of risk are the key driver with changing provider/supplier behavior which would help achieve the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals. as harvard medical school researchers j. michael mcwilliams et al. noted in their report, medicare spending after 3 years of the medicare shared savings program, published in the new england journal of medicine (nejm) on sept. 20, contracts with no downside risk contracts, which appeal to smaller organizations, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaybe effective in lowering medicare spending.\u00e2\u0080\u009d we urge the agency to focus on incentivizing the care transformations tied to population health and value-based care rather than focus on requiring risk as the sole mechanism to change provider behavior.\n the significant increase in the enhanced track risk level is based on an increased shared loss rate and a much higher benchmark-based loss sharing limit. the downside financial risk models in the basic track include lower shared loss rates and a revenue-based loss sharing limit, which caps risk based on provider revenue rather than total cost of care, which is the basis for the benchmark-based loss sharing limit. the enhanced track does not include a revenue-based loss sharing limit, and we urge the agency to create one and to create more options for gradual risk increases between basic level e and the enhanced track. it is also essential that cms revise its policies to keep the enhanced track voluntary, as with track 3, and not attempt to push acos into a model with levels of risk they are unprepared to assume. requiring acos to potentially pay millions of dollars to medicare is simply not practical or feasible for many organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n 5\n downside risk after fewer years of participation, cause acos to leave the program.\u00e2\u0080\u009d using a government mandate to assume high levels of provider risk is not the solution to increasing aco participation and achieving successful results for acos. the unintended consequences of forcing high levels of risk will significantly undermine the mssp and result in diverting valuable investments in care coordination away from medicare patients and towards other patients under value-based contracts. further, the disproportionate emphasis on reducing costs often overshadows the equally important goal of quality improvement that the aco model offers, which benefits patients and the medicare program generally. while some acos have not yet been able to experience a return on the investments they have made, they have generated savings to the government while improving patient care, which studies show has a positive downstream impact on spending, but may take years to fully materialize. for example, mssp acos generated gross savings of $1.1 billion for py 2017 based on the cms methodology for setting financial benchmarks. sixty percent of acos saved medicare money in 2017 with 34 percent of acos earning shared savings and 26 percent of acos generating savings for medicare but not enough savings meet the threshold (i.e., the minimum savings rate (msr)) needed to earn shared-savings payments. these acos are on the right path, and we urge cms to support them so they continue to generate savings for medicare and positive quality for beneficiaries. success does not equal assuming risk. we urge cms to allow all acos to remain indefinitely in basic level e without being forced to move to the enhanced track.\n\n2. moving to five-year agreement periods \n\n key comment: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco urges cms to finalize its proposals to enact extended, five-year agreement periods and to eliminate restrictions that prevent acos from re-entering the program after terminating a participation agreement.\n proposals: cms proposes to extend the length of agreement periods from three years to five years. specifically, for agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019, the length of the agreement would be five years and six months. for agreement periods beginning on january 1, 2020, and in subsequent years, the length of the agreement would be five years. cms also proposes to remove current restrictions that prevent an aco from terminating its participation agreement and re-entering the program prior to when the existing agreement period would have ended.\n comments: we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to extend the length of agreement periods from three years to five years, which will promote program stability. extended agreement periods allow acos a longer horizon on which to plan and to benefit from efficiency gains before benchmark rebasing. bidco wishes to see improved program stability and predictability and shifting to longer agreement periods will enable that. we urge cms to finalize this change as proposed. we also support the proposal to modify current restrictions that prevent an aco from terminating its participation agreement and re-entering the program before the existing agreement period would have ended. this \u00e2\u0080\u009csit out\u00e2\u0080\u009d period is unnecessary and shuts providers out of participating in an essential cms value-based program. eliminating this restriction will allow the flexibility for an aco in an agreement period to terminate its participation agreement and then enter a new five-year agreement period under one of the redesigned participation options proposed in this rule. we recommend cms finalize this as proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6\n\n3. timeframe to transition to risk \n\n key comments: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco urges cms to finalize a policy allowing all new acos entering the program to remain in basic track level a for two years and basic track level b for an additional two years before requiring the aco to move to level c in the fifth and final year of their agreement. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco also asks cms to allow acos meeting certain performance criteria to participate for a third year in basic track level b, providing acos that demonstrate superior performance with up to five years in basic track levels a and b.\n proposals: cms proposes acos would progress from shared savings only to risk-based models under timeframes that apply to acos differently depending largely on previous program experience and aco type (high vs. low revenue). levels a and b of the basic track would be shared savings-only models, and after two years, acos would gradually assume more risk over time as they progress along basic track levels c through e. cms proposes to automatically advance acos over time across the levels and allow acos to elect annually to move up to higher risk levels in the basic track more quickly than what is required. the new proposed structure includes a more gradual glide path for assuming risk between basic track levels a through level e. however, there remains a significant jump in the risk level required when moving from basic level e (losses capped at 4 percent of the benchmark) to the enhanced track (losses capped at 15 percent of the benchmark).\n cms proposes acos would not be permitted to switch from the basic track to the enhanced track during their five-year agreement period. however, because cms proposes to eliminate the current restriction that prevents acos that terminate during an agreement from re-entering the program before the contract would have ended, an aco could terminate its contract and quickly move to the enhanced track under a new agreement.\n comments: bidco appreciates cms efforts to encourage providers to move to risk by introducing a structure that includes a more gradual glide path for assuming risk through the basic track. however, we have significant concerns that reducing the amount of time available in shared savings-only models would be detrimental to the program and the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals of encouraging providers to participate in alternative payment models (apms). research shows that acos improve over time in the program. acos participating in the mssp over a longer period of time show greater improvement in financial performance, demonstrating the value of such models and the need to allow acos sufficient time to demonstrate positive results. for example, as detailed in tables 1 through 3 below, it took the average aco that earned savings in 2017 three years to initially generate savings. of the 142 acos that earned shared savings payments in 2017 and had prior program experience, 36 percent had losses (i.e., expenditures higher than benchmarks) in one of their first two years of the program. had cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed policies been in place, these acos would not have had the opportunity to continue in the program and go on to demonstrate success. a critical component of performance improvement lies in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to analyze the performance data being provided to the aco and make targeted improvements based on this information. under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current proposal, acos would have only one year of performance data before being required to move to a risk-based model. this is not sufficient and will not allow acos the opportunity to make strategic decisions regarding performance improvement which allow them to demonstrate success in future program years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 7\n table 1: net savings by aco cohort mssp cohort (based on start year) net savings to medicare, 2017* (millions) average savings per beneficiary 2012

save cms money and improve quality for the patients they serve. the recent mssp performance year 2017 results show net savings to the medicare trust fund of $314 million, which is after accounting for shared savings payments made to acos. further, as noted in the june 2018 medicare payment advisory commission (medpac) report, chapter 8, medicare accountable care organization models: recent performance and long-term issues, there are a number of scientific evaluations that show aco savings. for example, the aforementioned peer- reviewed studies by harvard university researchers found that the mssp saved more than $200 million in 2013 and 2014 and $144.6 million in 2015 after accounting for shared savings bonuses earned by acos. a recently released study by dobson davanzo & associates using similar rigorous methods found that acos saved $1.84 billion from 2013 through 2015 and reduced medicare spending by $542 million after accounting for shared savings bonuses. in the proposed rule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact analysis, cms estimates that the overall impact of acos, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cspillover effects\u00e2\u0080\u009d on medicare spending outside of the aco program, lowered spending by $1.8 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $4.2 billion (0.5 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1.2 percent) in 2016 alone. these analyses provide important evidence that acos save more money for medicare than what is reflected in basic evaluations of performance compared to cms benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n 8\n acos have also demonstrated impressive quality results. a 2017 oig report, medicare program shared savings acos have shown potential for reducing spending and improving quality, found that acos achieved high quality and in particular noted progress on important measures, including reduced hospital readmissions and screening beneficiaries for risk of falling and depression. recently released mssp performance year 2017 data shows a mean quality score of 90.5 percent out of 100 percent for acos subject to pay-for-performance measures. further, analysis of mssp performance year 2016 results shows that acos improve quality over time, with average performance improving 15 percent across 25 measures used consecutively across program years. evidence clearly shows that acos improve over time in the program and that shared savings only models generate savings to cms and improve quality of care for the patients they serve. therefore, it is critical that cms allow acos to remain in shared savings only models (basic track levels a and b) for more than the proposed two years.\n if finalized, there will be a detrimental effect on new applicants and participation in the aco program will be diminished. we request that cms modify proposals for all acos (including both high- and low- revenue acos) to allow more time to participate in shared savings-only models. specifically, bidco urges cms to finalize a policy allowing all new acos to remain in basic track level a for two years and basic track level b for an additional two years before requiring the aco to move to level c in the fifth and final year of their agreement. these acos should then be permitted to begin their second agreement period at basic track level d where they would participate for three years and progress to level e for the final two years of their second agreement period (with options to progress more quickly if the aco chooses). this would provide acos with four years of participation in shared savings only models and a fifth year for those that demonstrate exceptional performance, as described below. providing acos with four years in shared savings-only models provides the aco with only two to three years of performance data, the minimum that would be necessary to identify trends and opportunities for transformation and improvement.\n bidco strongly believes acos who meet superior performance criteria should also be permitted to participate for a third year in basic track level b, allowing high-performing acos to remain in a shared savings only model for a full five-year agreement period in cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed basic track. specifically, based on evaluation of the previous three performance years, we urge cms to allow acos that meet at least one of the criteria below to have a third year in basic track level b, giving the aco a full five-year agreement period in a shared savings only model:\n\n1. acos that generate net savings across three performance years: acos have demonstrated an \n increased likelihood of achieving shared savings over time. this is likely the result of a combination of factors, such as their experience, realization of long-term commitments and investments in priorities such as care coordination, quality improvement, and data analytics. this trend is promising and means more savings over time for the medicare trust fund. however, many acos generate savings, as defined by having expenditures lower than their benchmark, but do not surpass their msr and thus do not qualify for earned shared savings. the msr in track 1 can be as high as 3.9 percent, which is a considerable hurdle. while these acos may not earn shared savings, they are saving medicare money and delivering high-quality care. cms has no reason to discourage their continued participation. therefore, we urge cms to allow acos that generate net savings relative to their benchmark across three performance years (including those that do not surpass their msr) to have the option of continuing in basic track level b for a third year following their participation in basic track level a for two years.\n\n2. acos that score at or above the 50th percentile in quality in one of two performance years: \n\n\n\n\n\n 9\n clinical improvements, staff training, and operational changes to result in high quality performance scores. though they may not have earned sufficient shared savings to allow them the financial readiness to assume risk, they have demonstrated high quality and should therefore be given additional opportunities to work on processes focused on lowering costs prior to being forced into a two-sided track. we urge cms to allow acos that score at or above the 50th percentile in quality performance in one of two performance years the option of continuing in basic track level b for a third year following their participation in basic track level a for two years.\n\n3. acos that improve their overall quality score by 10 percentage points or greater over the \n course of performance years: acos that demonstrate a significant improvement in their quality score have made a clear investment in quality and have had a positive impact on the medicare beneficiaries. these acos should be rewarded for these efforts and provided additional time to give their investments in quality an opportunity to materialize into cost savings, rather than being prematurely forced into a two-sided risk track. therefore, we urge cms to allow acos that improve their overall quality score by 10 percentage points over the course of the two performance years the option of continuing in basic track level b for a third year following their participation in basic track level a for two years.\n adopting these changes would provide acos with the time they need to transform health care through meaningful clinical and operational changes to put patients first by improving their care and reducing unnecessary expenditures. these transformations are significant and, as such, require time for implementation and to produce measurable results. acos are investing millions of dollars of their own capital to make these care improvements, even though medicare does not recognize these start-up and ongoing investments in its calculations of aco savings, losses, and costs. further, the benefits of these transformations extend beyond the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed medicare fee-for-service patient population and have a broader effect on medicare advantage beneficiaries and even patient populations beyond medicare. finalizing cms proposals to drastically reduce the amount of time available to acos in shared savings- only models will minimize the positive impact acos have on their communities. it is critical that cms provide acos with additional time in shared savings-only models to allow for a successful transition from fee-for-service to value-based care.\n\n4. shared savings and loss rates, loss sharing limits \n\n key comments: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco urges cms not to cut in half the shared savings rates for shared savings only acos and to apply the following shared savings rates: 50 percent for basic levels a and b, 55 percent for basic levels c and d, and 60 percent for basic level\ne. \n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco strongly recommends that cms emphasize and reward above average quality performance or improvement by providing additional shared savings on a sliding scale up to 10 percentage points. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco urges the agency to lower the benchmark-based level e loss sharing limit to equal macra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally applicable nominal amount standard of 3 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n 10\n on quality performance and would apply to first dollar shared savings for acos that meet or exceed their\nmsr.  \n\n the shared savings and loss rates would gradually increase across the levels until they reach those in level e, which has the same shared savings and loss rates as track 1+. the proposed shared loss rates remain constant at 30 percent across levels c, d and e while the amount of maximum losses, i.e., the loss sharing limit, gradually increases. cms proposes to determine the loss sharing limit (benchmark- based versus revenue-based) by calculating both thresholds for a particular level, such as 2 percent of total medicare parts a and b fee-for-service (ffs) revenue for aco participants in a level c aco, and compare that to 1 percent of the historical benchmark. the loss sharing limit for level e would be tied to the advanced apm nominal amount standard, by setting the level e loss sharing limit equal to the revenue-based nominal amount standard, currently at 8 percent, and 1 percent higher than the advanced apm benchmark-based nominal amount standard, currently set at 3 percent. cms would apply the lesser of the two thresholds for the loss sharing limit, and the agency explains it would determine the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loss sharing limit annually at the time of financial reconciliation.\n table a: new proposed mssp structure basic enhanced level a level b level c level d level e 25% sharing rate 25% sharing rate 30% sharing rate 40% sharing rate 50% sharing rate 75% sharing rate upside only upside

exceed 8% of revenue capped at 4% of benchmark 1st dollar losses at 40% to 75% not to exceed 15% of benchmark\n comments:\n shared savings rates\n\n\n\n\n\n 11\n\n the shared savings rates have been debated numerous times with many calls to increase shared savings rates above the current 50 percent in track 1 and 1+. for example, as shown in the excerpt below from page 67929 of the november 2011 mssp final rule which initially set the mssp shared savings rates, many commenters including medpac called for much higher shared savings rates, such as 75 percent, to incentivize aco participation.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommenters suggested sharing rates ranging from 50 to 95 percent (most commonly 75 percent) under the one-sided model and 66 to 95 percent (most commonly 80 percent) under the two-sided model. medpac recommended increasing the sharing rates for both models, suggesting, for example, offering a savings rate of up to 75 percent for the one-sided model and 95 percent for the two-sided model for the first agreement period.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n given repeated calls for cms to raise shared savings rates, it is very disappointing that the agency proposes to cut these rates in half for acos in shared savings-only models. cms does not provide an adequate rationale for slashing these rates. it appears the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal to push more acos into models with downside financial risk is the driving force behind these proposed lower shared savings rates. yet naacos-commissioned work published on sept. 11, 2018 in health affairs and elsewhere show mssp generated $1.84 billion in savings for medicare between 2013 and 2015, more than double cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimates comparing performance to aco benchmarks. that work, and others like it, tried to replicate what spending would have been in the absence of acos, a better judge of savings than cms-derived benchmarks. these savings are sure to grow over more recent years as more acos participate in mssp and gain the experience needed to produce positive results.\n there have been some public comments from cms leaders that acos in shared savings-only models do not generate savings. however, recent cms data on py 2017 mssp results, available in the public use file, shows this claim is not true. acos in shared savings-only models and those with downside financial risk both had net positive savings in 2017. in fact, as shown in table 4, the savings per beneficiary was higher for acos in track 1.\n table 4: net savings for acos based on track track net savings to medicare (millions)* means savings per beneficiary percent acos generating savings track 1 $290 $138 33% track 2/3 $23 $55 51% *net savings factors in bonuses paid to acos\n rather than make shared savings-only models less appealing, we urge cms to focus its efforts on making models with downside financial risk more attractive while continuing to support shared savings-only models. it is essential that cms structure the program such that it includes a business model attractive enough to retain current participants while bringing in new acos to create a pipeline for acos to advance on the path to value-based care. the proposed shared savings rates will fall short of that goal. therefore, we urge cms to maintain a 50 percent shared savings rate for basic levels a and b and to apply a 55 percent shared savings rate for levels c and d and a 60 percent shared savings rate for level\ne.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12\n further, we request cms adjust shared savings rates based on quality, which is a primary goal of the aco program. unfortunately, acos that achieve high-quality performance are not rewarded through increased shared savings or higher benchmarks. in contrast, medicare advantage (ma) plans are rewarded with higher benchmarks for higher quality, which puts acos at a disadvantage. as medpac noted in its feb. 2, 2015 letter to cms, \u00e2\u0080\u009cotherwise, the aco with top quality performance would end up with a lower benchmark than an ma plan in the same market with top quality performance. that situation could be seen as inequitable for the aco.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n efforts to improve quality consume aco resources and increase spending relative to financial benchmarks in the short term, even if these efforts decrease medicare spending over the long term. for example, an aco that does extensive patient outreach for cancer screening, such as colonoscopies, could expend considerable resources delivering these services, that may prevent the need for expensive late- stage cancer treatments for the screened patients. acos that make large investments to improve quality performance may be less able to keep spending below their benchmarks as a direct result of their increased investment in quality. we urge cms to use a similar approach for ma and mssp by properly rewarding acos for high quality. it is important to recognize high-quality performance compared to established measure thresholds as well as to recognize \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and reward \u00e2\u0080\u0093 quality improvement relative to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous performance. therefore, to emphasize and reward above average quality performance or improvement, we urge cms to provide on a sliding scale up to 10 percentage points of additional shared savings.\n shared loss rates\n bidco supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to gradually introduce risk with the new basic track levels c and d. however, we support asymmetric models such that the shared loss rates are lower than the shared savings rates. this would be accomplished through cms raising the shared savings rates as detailed above. should the agency not follow these recommendations, we urge the agency to lower the shared loss rates such that those for levels c and d would be set at 20 percent and 25 percent respectively. this supports a gradual ramp up of assuming risk under an asymmetric approach.\n loss sharing limits\n cms notes the proposed approach for determining loss sharing limits would tend to place acos that include hospitals under a benchmark-based loss sharing limit because the participants of these acos typically have higher total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue compared to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark. we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to apply a loss sharing limit that is the lesser of the revenue-based or benchmark- based threshold. this allows flexibility for acos and does not place them in a particular category as a result of their aco participant composition. we recommend cms finalize this as proposed.\n we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to set the loss sharing limits for level e so those acos continue to qualify for advanced apm bonuses under the qpp established by the 2015 medicare access and chip reauthorization act (macra). however, we urge the agency to lower the benchmark-based level e loss sharing limit to equal the macra generally applicable nominal amount standard, rather than setting it one percent higher, as proposed. this would result in a level e benchmark-based loss sharing limit of 3 percent for 2019, which reflects the level of risk cms considers sufficient for macra advanced apms. this represents a more gradual increase in risk and aligns with the approach used for the revenue-based loss sharing limit, which is proposed to be set equal to, not higher than, the macra generally applicable nominal amount standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n 13\n cms explains that the agency would determine an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loss sharing limit annually at the time of financial reconciliation. while the agency notes this is consistent with its current process for track 2 and 3 acos, the timing of this determination is troubling. financial reconciliation occurs months after the close of the performance year, meaning acos would face uncertainly about their maximum potential losses until after the performance year is over. one of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals with the proposed rule is to promote predictability and stability, a goal shared by bidco. however, not knowing the maximum amount of losses an aco may face creates significant uncertainty that undermines cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on improved predictability and stability. participation in mssp tracks 2 and 3 remains low, and the uncertainty about potential losses is one of the reasons that has prevented more acos from joining these downside financial risk models. we urge cms to learn from this lesson and provide the loss sharing limit determination prior to or at the start of the performance year rather than at the time of financial reconciliation.\n\n5. minimum savings rate and minimum loss rate  \n\n key comments: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco recommends cms finalize its proposal to allow acos in downside financial risk models to select a symmetrical msr/mlr but requests acos be able to update this selection during an agreement period. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco urges cms to lower the msr for shared savings-only models to be set between 2.0 and 2.5 percent.\n proposals: in order to qualify for a shared savings payment, or to be responsible for sharing losses with cms, an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s average per capita medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for its assigned beneficiary population for the performance year must be below or above the updated benchmark, respectively, by at least the msr/mlr. for acos under basic track levels a and b, cms proposes to use the same sliding scale for the msr that is currently used for track 1, which is based on the number of beneficiaries assigned to the aco to establish the msr.\n prior to entering a model with downside financial risk (basic levels c, d, e or the enhanced track), cms proposes to continue to have an aco select a symmetrical msr/mlr. this selection would be made as part of the application cycle prior to entering a model with downside financial risk and the selection would apply for the duration of the applicable agreement period. the aco would be able to choose from the following options, consistent with current policy:\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 0 percent msr/mlr \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 symmetrical msr/mlr in a 0.5 percent increment between 0.5 and 2.0 percent \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 symmetrical msr/mlr that varies based on the number of beneficiaries assigned to the aco\n the variable msr/mlr would be determined based on the number of assigned beneficiaries as is currently used for two-sided model acos that have selected the variable option. cms also proposes to use a variable msr/mlr when performing shared savings and shared losses calculations if an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population falls below 5,000 for the performance year, regardless of whether the aco selected a fixed or variable msr/mlr.\n\n\n\n\n\n 14\n conservative or aggressive their goals are for earning savings and having to repay losses. given the extended five-year agreement periods cms proposes, we urge the agency to allow acos to change their msr/mlr at the start of a performance year rather than be locked into that decision for up to five years of an agreement period.\n while the secretary has a statutory requirement to determine an msr based upon the number of medicare ffs beneficiaries assigned to an aco, there is no specific statutory requirement for msrs to rise as high as 3.9 percent for smaller acos. this creates a significant hurdle for smaller and rural acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 groups of providers cms has vowed to help \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to earn savings and thus a disincentive to join the mssp. we urge cms to use its authority to lower that threshold and revise the msr schedule for acos based on beneficiary population size such that the cap on msrs for smaller acos is 2.5 percent, and to meet statutory requirements, for larger acos would be set as low as 2 percent.\n\n6. high revenue and low revenue aco designations \n\n key comments: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco urges cms not to finalize the arbitrary distinction of high- and low-revenue acos and opposes requirements that high-revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or any acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco urges cms not to require any acos to participate in the enhanced track but to keep that a voluntary model for acos prepared for higher levels of risk and reward. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco recommends cms reinstate advanced funding opportunities to help acos assume risk.\n proposals: cms proposes to create a new distinction that measures parts a and b ffs revenue compared to aco benchmarks in order to categorize acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009clow revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos.  this distinction determines program specifics such as the timing for when an aco must move to risk. for example, new high revenue acos would be required to move to the enhanced track after one agreement period in the basic track. under current track 1+ requirements, acos provide information to cms about their participants, and cms uses that information to determine if the aco falls under the revenue- or benchmark-based risk standard. the proposed method for determining high revenue or low revenue acos removes the aco self-reporting requirement, and cms would instead use medicare claims data to make this determination. the new approach would no longer directly consider ownership or operational interests but would focus on participant revenue compared to benchmarks. the proposed definitions of high revenue and low revenue acos are as follows: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 high revenue aco means an aco whose total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue of its aco participants is at least 25 percent of the total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 low revenue aco means an aco whose total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue of its aco participants is less than 25 percent of the total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries\n\n\n\n\n\n 15\n with a lower msr in levels a and b (1 or 2 percent) or using a higher shared savings rates such as 50 percent for levels a through d. cms notes that hospital- or health system-based acos will typically be considered high revenue acos, but hospital-based acos with relatively low aco participant ffs revenue compared to their benchmark would be low revenue acos.\n comments: in the proposed rule, cms states its belief that acos whose participants have greater total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue relative to their benchmarks have more ability to control costs and may be better financially prepared to move to greater levels of risk. accordingly, the agency notes that its comparison of revenue to benchmark would provide a more accurate method for determining an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preparedness to take on additional risk rather than an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-reported information regarding the composition of its aco participants and any ownership and operational interests in those aco participants. we do not support the current self-reporting requirements for track 1+ that result in acos falling under the revenue- or benchmark-based track 1+ loss sharing limits. we have previously urged cms to provide track 1+ acos flexibility to select either a revenue- or benchmark-based loss sharing limit, and we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to apply the lesser of the revenue- or benchmark-based loss sharing limit for basic level e.\n while we appreciate removing the self-reporting requirements under track 1+, we question the need to further divide acos into arbitrary categories of high and low revenue acos and to apply different schedules for how and when they must progress along the risk continuum. the proposed 25 percent threshold appears arbitrary and creates division where none should exist. we oppose categorizing acos in this manner and urge cms to not finalize the high and low revenue distinctions. all acos should be on the same path to assuming risk as recommended in this letter, which should include a gradual ramp up of risk, sufficient shared savings rates, and the ability to participate indefinitely in basic level e without having to move to the enhanced track.\n being \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009clow\u00e2\u0080\u009d revenue does not determine when an aco is ready for risk or how much risk they are able to assume. regardless of structure, significant investments are needed in population health platforms and care process changes for acos to bear risk. the financial position and backing of a particular aco as well as the ability to assume risk depends on a variety of factors, such as local market dynamics, culture, leadership, financial status, previous program success, and the resources required to address social determinants of health that influence care and outcomes for patients. providers in rural areas and safety-net providers, which care for some of the most vulnerable patient populations, often face even greater challenges than other providers when considering taking on risk. research shows that insurers and venture capital funds are investing millions of dollars in certain acos, which are often physician-led. cms is unable to identify if an aco is well capitalized through outside sources, such as investors or insurers, and should therefore not use an arbitrary calculation of revenue compared to benchmark to make this assumption. the challenge of being forced into risk is of great importance to acos of all sizes, composition, and ownership. it would be more reasonable to lower the required amount of risk for both high and low revenue acos rather than treat them differently.\n\n\n\n\n\n 16\n revenue distinction, we urge cms provide the final determination as early as possible in the application process, baring notable participant changes during the process which would change the determination. given the significance of this determination, acos must know in advance into which category they would fall.\n while we appreciate the gradual ramp up of risk in the basic track, the overall restructuring of the mssp has considerably more complexity with cms evaluating whether acos are new, renewing or re-entering, experienced or inexperienced with performance-based risk, high or low revenue, etc. eliminating the high/low revenue distinction would help minimize some of the complexity and would remove a significant amount of work required by cms and acos to model, predict, and determine if the aco would be high or low revenue.\n the administration commented about supporting market solutions and level playing fields among competitors. we appreciate that perspective and respectfully point out that this proposed policy is contrary to a market-based approach whereby all competitors have similar opportunities for success. rather than finalize unnecessary and arbitrary distinctions for acos, cms should work to support all acos as they progress on the value-based care continuum, and the agency should create meaningful incentives for acos to assume risk. the goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients, and cms should adopt policies that continue to engage hospitals as key players rather than create incentives to exclude hospitals as aco participants. the best way to drive high-quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate to innovate and deliver high-quality, cost-effective health care. medpac addressed this in its june 2018 report noting that while hospitals may have certain conflicting interests that create challenges for aco participation, the commission recommends hospitals should continue to be part of acos.\n the administration has also noted concerns that acos are a potential driver of consolidation in the health care industry. there are no studies or data supporting this claim, which is a flawed assumption. reduced payment rates, increased regulatory burdens and requirements to assume risk are actual drivers of consolidation, and organizations often consolidate to more efficiently manage these challenges. further, acos do not drive physician employment and many effective acos engage a majority of independent clinicians. acos support greater clinical integration and collaboration among doctors, hospitals and other care providers and align the payment system to incent coordination and cost savings across these silos. this alignment accomplishes what the model is designed to do, and what providers need out of high-value networks, without necessitating consolidation and direct employment of physicians. in fact, these opportunities to collaborate often help providers avoid consolidation. the greatest fear related to consolidation is its potential to lead to higher prices. ultimately, one of the best ways to protect against escalating costs is to advance alternative payment models that hold providers accountable and reward them for improving care and reducing costs for an entire population.\n in addition to our recommendations not to finalize the distinction between high and low revenue acos, we recommend that cms support acos by reinstating advanced funding opportunities to enable acos to assume risk. the agency previously offered programs to help fund acos up front, with those payments later recouped via shared savings. these programs, such as the aco investment model (aim) or similar ones, should be reinstated to help acos fund activities and transformations early on in development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 17\n\n7. risk adjustment  \n\n key comments: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco urges cms to implement the same risk adjustment policy across medicare programs. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 as an interim step to implementing consistent risk adjustment policies across medicare programs, bidco supports the proposal to modify mssp risk adjustment by eliminating the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to allow risk score changes during an agreement period but urges the agency to use a more appropriate range of +/- 5 percent and to cap the risk ratios in aggregate across the four beneficiary enrollment types.\n proposals: cms proposes to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries for the purposes of mssp risk adjustment. the agency also proposes to use a symmetric +/- 3 percent risk ratio cap between the performance year renormalized risk score and the most recent benchmark year for all assigned beneficiaries. cms would continue to use full cms-hierarchal condition category (hcc) risk adjustment for all assigned beneficiaries between the benchmark period and the performance year, and the risk scores would continue to be renormalized within each of the four beneficiary enrollment types. similarly, cms would continue to use full cms-hcc risk scores when resetting or rebasing the historical benchmark prior to each new agreement period.\n comments: risk adjustment modifies costs to reflect beneficiary health status and plays a critical role in enabling more accurate comparisons across acos and providers that treat beneficiaries of varying clinical complexity. there have been long-standing concerns about the mssp risk adjustment methodology, which cms acknowledges in the proposed rule, stating on page 41884:\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe appreciate the concerns regarding our current risk adjustment methodology raised by stakeholders, who have indicated that the current approach may not adequately recognize negative changes in health status that occur at the individual beneficiary level, particularly among continuously assigned beneficiaries who have experienced an acute event, such as a heart attack, stroke, or hip fracture, between the third benchmark year and the applicable performance year. we recognize that such acute events, which almost always require a hospitalization, are likely to have an upward impact on cms-hcc risk scores that is not attributable to provider coding initiatives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n accurate risk adjustment should remove or minimize differences in health and other risk factors that impact performance but are outside the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control. while there are many different approaches to risk adjustment, it is unclear why medicare uses an array of risk adjustment methodologies across its programs. the same risk adjustment approach should be used across medicare, creating parity and emphasizing the need to come to consensus on the most appropriate methodology. we urge cms to invest in studying risk adjustment across medicare programs and to identify the most appropriate approach that should be applied across all medicare programs. this would help fix the current mssp risk adjustment policy, which is biased to produce a downward benchmark adjustment versus the risk adjustment policies in other medicare programs, including ma. putting acos at a disadvantage compared to providers in other medicare programs and apms masks the true effects of acos and creates a disincentive to participate in the mssp. as an interim step to implementing the same risk adjustment policy across medicare programs, we offer the following recommendations in response to those proposals in the pathways to success rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n 18\n the current mssp policy that treats beneficiaries differently depending on whether they are considered newly or continuously assigned creates unnecessary confusion and complexity. cms is in effect limiting risk adjustment due to demographic factors for continuously assigned beneficiaries. it is unreasonable to assume a provider organization, however effective, can manage a population such that patient conditions never worsen over time and it never carries a higher disease burden. therefore, we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to eliminate the newly and continuously assigned beneficiary categories and recommend additional changes to the risk adjustment proposals.\n we appreciate aspects of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow risk scores for beneficiaries to change somewhat over time, which begins to recognize the reality that patient risk scores fluctuate. it is essential that benchmarks reflect these risk changes so that acos are fairly judged on their performance without being unfairly expected to manage an overall population\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease burden with virtually no changes during an agreement period. bidco has repeatedly advocated for cms to permit meaningful increases in beneficiary risk scores over time. while the proposal would permit an increase of up to 3 percent, it is important to note that 3 percent is across a five-year agreement period and is not a year-over-year increase.\n though we appreciate the agency allowing risk score increases, the selection of 3 percent is arbitrary and insufficient when applied across a five-year agreement. for example, assuming that an aco starts in july 2019, the most that the risk score used in the updated benchmark calculation can change in performance year six (2024) would be between 97 to 103 percent of the 2018 risk score (based on 2017 hcc coding practices). this risk adjustment proposal would be reasonable in early years of the agreement period, when most acos would hit the 3 percent cap, but it would not be reasonable when applied to later years of the agreement. using mssp py 2017 results, 87 percent of acos would have had at least one enrollment type trigger the +/-3 percent cap when looking at the first three years of the agreement period. the average percentage capped in the first performance year of the agreement period is 88 percent, in the second performance year is 85 percent and the third performance year is 92 percent. over the fourth and fifth performance years we would expect the percentage of acos affected by the risk score cap to increase. we recommend cms finalize a policy that allows risk score adjustments during the course of the agreement period, but we urge a more reasonable threshold of +/- 5 percent. this is the threshold at which the percentage of capped aco populations within the same enrollment type drops below 25 percent based on the 2017 mssp results.\n alternative to the proposal, we support cms capping the risk ratios in aggregate across the four beneficiary enrollment types (esrd, disabled, aged/dual eligible, and aged/non-dual eligible). the different enrollment types show significantly different cap rates with aged/dual the highest at 59 percent capped and aged/non-dual the lowest at 24 percent capped in 2017 due to smaller sample sizes and volatility for certain enrollment types. we recommend cms finalize capping the enrollment types in aggregate instead of separately by enrollment type conjunction with the broader +/- 5 percent cap in order to further promote benchmark stability.\n finally, in order to reduce benchmark volatility, the risk adjustment model version should be consistent between the baseline and performance years. for example, the version 23 cms-hcc model could be used when comparing risk scores in the 2016-2018 baseline period to those in the 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2024 performance period. the next generation aco program follows this convention demonstrating that it is administratively feasible to maintain a consistent risk adjustment model version throughout the baseline and performance periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19\n\n8. benchmarking methodology \n\n key comments: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco urges cms to finalize proposals to introduce regional expenditure data into initial agreement periods and to apply a varying degree of regional expenditure data based on how an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending compares to its region. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco opposes cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to decrease the regional expenditure component to 50 percent and recommends that agency maintain the current maximum of 70 percent of regional expenditures in the third agreement and subsequent agreement periods. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco does not support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a symmetric +/- 5 percent cap based on national per capita expenditures and recommends the agency not finalize this. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to find an appropriate balance between a national and regional trend rate, but instead of finalizing the proposal we request the agency remove aco beneficiaries from the regional reference population to address the underlying problem. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco urges cms to reverse its position on adjusting rebased benchmarks to account for the average per capita amount of savings generated during an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous agreement period by adding those savings back to the rebased benchmark.\n proposals: cms proposes a number of benchmarking changes that, if finalized, would go into effect along with the revised mssp structure. many of the proposals relate to incorporating a regional expenditure component into the rebased benchmark, a direction the agency finalized in 2016 with the mssp rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 revised benchmark rebasing methodology, facilitating transition to performance-based risk, and administrative finality of financial calculations (published in the june 10, 2016 federal register). under that regulation, which remains in place as existing policy, cms incorporates a growing component of regional expenditures into benchmarks as they are rebased for new agreement periods. in this rule, cms proposes to incorporate regional expenditures into benchmarks sooner, beginning with initial agreement periods and to cap the maximum amount of regional expenditures at 50 percent. this would modify the phase-in schedule such that acos would have a regional expenditure component of: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 25 or 35 percent during the first agreement period, \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 35 or 50 percent during the second agreement period, and \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 50 percent during third and subsequent agreement periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n 20\n component of the blended trend and update factors would receive a weight equal to 1 minus the national weight.\n comments: bidco supports incorporating a component of regional expenditure data into aco benchmarks. rather than exclusively relying on regional expenditure data we specifically support blending aco historical and regional expenditure data for rebased benchmarks. relying exclusively on regional expenditure data for rebased benchmarks would not properly reflect an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique patient population. relying exclusively on historical aco expenditure data creates an unattainable situation where acos have decreased ability to beat ever-lowering benchmarks. if executed correctly, using benchmarks with a blend of historical and regional expenditure data will attract new acos while retaining existing participants and ultimately improve the long-term viability of the program.\n we support the proposal to introduce a regional expenditure component into the initial agreement period, rather than waiting until at least the second agreement period. this is especially important with longer, five-year agreement periods. we also strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued application of one of two regional expenditure components based on how the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending compares to that of its region, and the proposed 25 percent and 35 percent thresholds are appropriate.  we recommend cms finalize these as proposed.\n as cms gradually introduces regional expenditures, for third and subsequent agreement periods we urge the agency not to finalize its proposal to cap regional expenditures at 50 percent. this is a decrease from the current policy of applying a maximum of 70 percent regional expenditure data. this policy was finalized two years ago and given the phase-in schedule of regional expenditure data, acos have not yet reached this level so it is premature to reverse this policy. we support a maximum of 70 percent of regional expenditures in the third agreement and subsequent agreement periods and recommend the following phase-in schedule such that acos would have a regional expenditure component of: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 25 or 35 percent during the first agreement period, \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 45 or 60 percent during the second agreement period, \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 70 percent during third and subsequent agreement periods\n we also urge cms to allow an option for acos to gradually incorporate regional expenditure data by 10 percent annually into their benchmarks during an agreement period. some acos will face significant swings in their aco benchmarks as a result of the revised methodology and allowing a gradual implementation would ease this transition rather than require acos to face large swings at the start of an agreement period. we reiterate our recommendation that this should be an option, and acos that are prepared to face more significant changes at the start of an agreement should be permitted to do so. overall, acos would ultimately reach the 70 percent regional benchmark, but providing program flexibility would keep acos progressing on the right path in a more reasonable manner that incentivizes them to stay in the program and continue focusing on reducing costs and improving quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n 21\n\n in response to concerns raised by naacos and others, cms proposes to no longer use a pure regional update factor, which disadvantages acos that make up a large portion of the market in their region. instead, cms proposes to modify the update factor by using a national-regional blended trend rate that would be based on the share of assignable beneficiary weighted national ffs and regional update factors. the national-regional blending factor would be determined by averaging the market penetration across all counties where the aco has assigned beneficiaries. this proposal is a step in the right direction to address some of our concerns with the regional update factor; however, we have concerns that the new methodology may over-emphasize the national trend component. there are pitfalls with solely using a national update factor, which ignores important local market dynamics and regional trends, and with using an exclusively regionally-based update factor, which as currently structured penalizes acos in rural areas and those that comprise a large share of their market and, therefore, drive regional trends.\n while we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to find an appropriate balance between a national and regional trend rate, there are pitfalls with the proposal. for example, the proposal dilutes the importance of regional trend in establishing and updating aco benchmarks. dampening the effect of regional trend diminishes the incentive that acos have to concentrate in high-trend areas of the country and control trend at the local level. further, this proposal does not address the underlying problem caused by including aco beneficiaries in the population from which the regional expenditure data is drawn. in fact, a simpler solution to the proposed national-regional trend rate would be to remove aco beneficiaries from the regional reference population as naacos has previously recommended. by excluding aco beneficiaries from the regional reference population, the situation where an aco is being directly evaluated against itself within the same performance year is eliminated.\n naacos and others have repeatedly made this recommendation to cms, including in prior comment letters in response to the 2016 mssp rule, and the concerns remain the same. rather than comparing acos to themselves and other acos, cms should compare aco performance relative to ffs medicare by defining the regional population as assignable beneficiaries without aco-assigned beneficiaries for all acos in the region. at the very least, cms should exclude the aco itself from the region to prevent an otherwise tautological comparison that essentially double counts those aco-assigned beneficiaries. in an area where the aco has significant market saturation, it is especially essential to remove the aco beneficiaries from the regional population to avoid comparing the aco to itself.\n excluding all aco-assigned beneficiaries (those involved in mssp acos and well as other cms aco demonstrations such as the next generation model) also allows for a cleaner comparison between acos and ffs. by including the aco-assigned beneficiary population, the regional cost data is skewed by reflecting acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to coordinate care and reduce expenditures for the aco population. cms has expressed concerns that removing aco-assigned beneficiaries would result in an insufficient reference population. however, according to naacos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 analysis based on 2017 data, if cms removed aco- assigned beneficiaries from the service area no acos would have a reference population smaller than about 300,000 beneficiaries. further, the contribution of beneficiaries from very small and aco- dominated counties to the regional benchmark is minimal with only 47 (10 percent) 2017 acos exposed to one or the other, with such counties contributing only as much as 4 percent of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall assigned population. continuing a flawed program methodology in order to address a small percentage of acos is nonsensical and, more importantly, harmful to the majority of program participants. we urge cms to modify its policy by changing the definition of the reference population to exclude all aco- assigned beneficiaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n 22\n to address those acos whose reference population falls below 5,000 after removing the aco-assigned beneficiaries, we recommend cms use a modified approach to reach 5,000 beneficiaries in those instances. for example, cms could bridge the gap by increasing the weight of the counties that have a lower proportion of resident aco beneficiaries, and thus higher ffs population. another option would be for cms to expand the regional service area to include assignable beneficiaries in adjoining counties until a sufficient comparison group is reached. yet another option, recommended by medpac in their march 11, 2016 comment letter to cms, would increase the stability of the regional ffs spending calculations by increasing the number of years of data included in the calculation. for example, by using a five-year rolling average for county-level spending estimates. in cases where area expenditures are driven largely by the acos, cms could similarly pull in contiguous counties to ensure a fair comparison. these approaches would both address cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concern about not having an adequate reference population and would be preferable to the current methodology.\n additionally, we recommend cms consider using a prospectively determined trend rate which would allow for greater predictability of financial results by acos. for example, prospective trend in us per capita cost is used to establish trend rates in the next generation model and medicare advantage programs. it is recommended that a similar prospective trend approach be used in the mssp. finally, we urge cms to reverse its position on adjusting rebased benchmarks to account for the average per capita amount of savings generated during an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous agreement period by adding those savings back to the rebased benchmark. cms has changed its policy on adding aco savings back to benchmarks a few times, and the most recent policy finalized in the june 2016 mssp rule no longer adds these savings to benchmarks. this final policy was disappointing considering cms had previously expressed support for adding the savings back to benchmarks and in a june 2015 mssp rule stated:\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe agree with commenters on the importance of accounting for the financial performance of an aco during its prior agreement period in resetting the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical benchmark. in particular, we believe that this adjustment is important for encouraging ongoing program participation by acos who have achieved success in achieving the three-part aim in their first agreement, by lowering expenditures and improving both the quality of care provided to medicare ffs beneficiaries and the overall health of those beneficiaries. absent this adjustment, an aco who previously achieved success in the program may elect to terminate its participation in the program rather than face a lower benchmark that reflects the lower costs for its patient population during the three most recent prior years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (80 fr 32778)\n savings generated by acos are achieved as a result of their hard work to improve quality and lower costs. acos should be accountable for their performance relative to ffs medicare in their region and rewarded \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not penalized \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for previous savings. thus, we urge cms not only to account for the earned shared savings in rebased benchmarks, but also to account for all savings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and add that amount to rebased benchmarks. at a very minimum, cms should return to the policy in the 2015 mssp rule which accounts for a portion of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s savings in rebased benchmarks.\n\n9. early termination policies  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23\n such a policy only in in rare cases where the agency specifically has program integrity concerns. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 we oppose cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to establish a june 30 deadline to voluntarily terminate aco participation agreements and hold acos accountable for all shared losses if terminating after this date. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco urges cms to provide acos with the ability to engage with high performing providers by allowing acos to select their participants by national provider identifier (npi) rather than solely at the tax identification number (tin) level.\n proposals: beginning on january 1, 2019, cms proposes to monitor whether an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expenditures for assigned beneficiaries population are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning that the expenditures exceed either the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative msr under a one-sided model or the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mlr under a two-sided model. if the aco is negative outside corridor for one performance year, cms proposes the agency may take pre- termination actions, including requiring a corrective action plan. if the aco is negative outside corridor for another performance year, cms proposes the agency may immediately or with advance notice terminate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement. cms also seeks comment on whether acos should be permitted to obtain reinsurance. cms proposes to reduce the minimum notification period from 60 to 30 days for early termination. this would allow acos considering a year-end termination to have three quarters of feedback reports, instead of two. cms would require acos in two-sided models that voluntarily terminate after june 30 to share in losses using the full 12 months of performance year expenditure data in performing reconciliation for terminated acos with partial year participation. to calculate the prorated share of losses, cms will multiply the amount of shared losses calculated for the performance year by the quotient equal to the number of months of participation in the program during the performance year, including the month in which the termination was effective, divided by 12. cms also proposes to prorate shared losses for acos in two-sided models that are involuntarily terminated by cms for any portion of the performance year during which the termination becomes effective. cms also proposes special rules for acos that participate for a portion of a six-month performance year during 2019 (january 1, 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093june 30, 2019 or july 1, 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0093december 31, 2019):\n1. if the aco terminates its participation agreement effective before the end of the performance \n year, cms would not reconcile the aco for shared savings or shared losses (if a two-sided model aco).\n2. if cms terminates a two-sided model aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement effective before the end \n of the performance year, the aco would not be eligible for shared savings and cms would reconcile the aco for shared losses and prorate the amount reflecting the number of months during the performance year that the aco was in the program.\n cms notes that acos starting a 12-month performance year in 2019 would have the option to participate for the first six months of the year prior to terminating their current agreement and entering a new agreement period beginning july 1, 2019. cms proposes these acos would be eligible for prorated shared savings or losses for the six-month period from january 1, 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 june 30, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n 24\n policy instead will have the unintended consequence of removing well-intentioned acos from the program who might otherwise go on to achieve savings and make quality improvements for their patients.\n program integrity is a critical tool for protecting the medicare trust fund. however, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed approach is arbitrary and so broadly applied that it will remove well-intentioned acos from the program. an aco with spending that is slightly higher than its benchmark should not be deemed a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad actor\u00e2\u0080\u009d especially considering there are a number of valid reasons spending for a performance year could be a few percentage points higher than a benchmark. for example, the beneficiary population could experience a worse than usual flu season, the hospital wage index in an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s area could increase relative to their benchmark years, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participant tins could have joined a cmmi program such as cpc+ which increases spending based on new care management fees, or the aco could have performed well in the merit-based incentive payment system (mips) and earned a mips bonus which cms includes as an aco expenditure. these are all valid reasons for higher than anticipated expenditures and should not cause the aco to be deemed a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad actor\u00e2\u0080\u009d or penalized by being terminated from the program. while we support addressing valid program integrity concerns, we urge cms not to consider slightly elevated spending as evidence of fraud, waste and abuse.\n further, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside the corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d sets a very low bar, especially for acos in downside financial risk models where the aco can select an mlr as low as 0 percent. many acos view selection of the msr/mlr in a two-sided model as a significant incentive to move into a model with downside financial risk, but this proposal would create a double-edged sword whereby an aco that wants to take on greater accountability through a lower mlr would be faced with potentially being terminated from the program as a result of spending that exceeds their mlr. this proposal also is not sensible in the context of acos assuming risk, whereby once they meet or exceed their mlr they must pay back a portion of losses to medicare. requiring these acos to repay losses protects the medicare trust fund and is unnecessary.\n should the agency move forward with this type of early termination policy, at a minimum it should be used only in rare cases where the agency specifically has documented program integrity concerns. alternatively, bidco encourages cms to better serve beneficiaries and american taxpayers by creating a direct channel for acos to report suspected fraud and abuse. value-based delivery models such as acos have a unique vantage point and the properly aligned incentives to identify and ultimately report fraud. on average, a medicare aco is assigned 17,000 lives and includes hundreds of clinicians. its success depends on an aco continuously monitoring its expenditures. because acos are held responsible for the total cost of care for their assigned beneficiaries, acos are also monitoring services rendered by clinicians outside the aco and keeping an eye on reimbursements completely removed from their own financial interests other than to achieve shared savings. that close attention to beneficiaries and the services they are accessing through medicare provides acos a frontline perspective to identify and report suspicious activity, yet acos have no direct access to cms program integrity. making this change would better support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stated fraud and abuse goals.\n should cms finalize its proposal to retain the right to terminate an aco whose expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the agency must use a more appropriate standard to identify acos who would be subject to such a policy. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed approach would monitor specifically for whether the expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries exceed the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark by an amount equal to or exceeding either the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative msr under a one-sided model or the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mlr under a two-sided model. of the 142 acos that earned shared savings payments for 2017 performance and had program experience prior to 2017, 36 percent had losses\n(i.e., expenditures higher than benchmarks) in one of their first two years of the program. such a policy \n\n\n\n\n\n 25\n would have removed these acos from the program prematurely, before they were able to go on and demonstrate success. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed policy is far too broad and contrary to the stated intent of the proposal.\n cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed approach is overreaching and it is critical that cms not move forward with this policy. further, should cms finalize this approach, the agency must also establish an appeal process for individual acos to submit information regarding errors they believe were made in the financial reconciliation calculation, determining the amount of shared savings earned by the aco or in determining an aco was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside the corridor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d currently, cms does not provide a meaningful appeal process for individual acos. if cms will retain the right to terminate an aco for exceeding certain spending thresholds, cms must apply the materiality threshold to individual acos and allow acos to appeal redetermination decisions they believe were made in error and, therefore, hold acos harmless for errors the agency makes in the payment determination process.\n bidco supports moving to a 30-day notification requirement for early termination if this would be used to modify the existing policy that allows acos to voluntarily terminate from the program without financial reconciliation for that performance year as long as they do so at least 60 days prior to the end of the performance year, which would be 30 days if the proposal is finalized. shortening this timeframe from 60 days to 30 days would provide more time for acos to evaluate program data and performance before deciding to terminate from the program without financial reconciliation for that year.\n we have significant concerns regarding the june 30 deadline proposed for acos electing to voluntarily terminate from the program. we urge cms not to finalize this policy as using a june 30 deadline for voluntary termination would mean that acos would not have the data they need to make an informed choice about their continued participation in the program. that data would not be available until later in the year due to the timing of distributing performance reports. acos should have three quarters of experience available to them to make a decision about their continued participation in the program. further, we are very concerned with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to hold acos accountable for a prorated amount of shared losses when voluntarily terminating from the program prior to june 30 and holding acos accountable for all shared losses when voluntarily terminating from the program after june 30. this is a departure from the current standards, and we recommend cms not prorate shared losses as proposed. should cms finalize changes to the current policy, we urge the agency to instead hold acos accountable for prorated shared losses only for acos choosing to terminate after the established voluntary termination deadline.\n\n10. 2019 participation options  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26\n\n proposals: cms is opening a new round of applications for 2019 with a shortened six-month performance period in 2019 due to the late nature of the regulation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release. for aco agreements that expire at the end of 2018, acos will have the option to extend current agreements for six months while offering a special, one-time july 1, 2019 start date for new agreements. the july 1, 2019 start will have a spring 2019 application period, and this start date option is also available to new acos. cms staff have also confirmed that, as proposed, acos within current agreement periods under mssp participation options (track 1, track 2, or track 3) would be able to complete the remainder of their current agreement under the existing financial models and requirements.\n program participation options are limited in some cases for acos with experience in a performance- based risk model as well as for acos designated as high revenue. additionally, participation options are determined in part based on whether cms considers an aco to be new, renewing, or re-entering. cms proposes to allow new acos to begin in level a of the basic track, and they would stay in the shared savings-only option (level b in performance year (py) 2) for the first two consecutive performance years. only acos that are inexperienced with performance-based risk can elect to participate in the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path. acos identified as experienced with performance-based risk must enter the basic track at level e if considered a low-revenue aco and must enter in the enhanced track if considered a high-revenue aco. low-revenue acos could participate in the basic track for up to two agreement periods, while high-revenue acos would be restricted to one agreement period in the basic track.\n cms proposes to define \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing acos\u00e2\u0080\u009d as those that continue in the program for a consecutive agreement period without a break in participation and are either:\n1. acos whose participation agreements expired and they immediately enter new agreement \n periods to continue participation in the program; or\n2. acos that voluntarily terminated their current participation agreements and they immediately \n enter new agreement periods to continue participation in the program.\n cms proposes to define \u00e2\u0080\u009cre-entering acos\u00e2\u0080\u009d as those that do not meet the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d and are either:\n1. the same legal entity as (a) an aco whose participation agreement expired without having \n been renewed; or (b) an aco whose aco participation agreement was terminated, or\n2. a new legal entity with more than 50 percent of its aco participants included on the aco \n participant list of the same aco in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date. re-entering acos are ineligible for level a and must begin at level b of the basic track.\n cms proposes to define acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced with performance-based risk\u00e2\u0080\u009d if either of the following are met:\n1. the aco is the same legal entity as a current or previous participant in a performance-based \n risk medicare aco initiative; or\n2. 40 percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk \n medicare aco initiative in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n\n\n\n\n\n 27\n summarize participation options for low- and high-revenue acos based on applicant type and the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience with risk.\n comments: bidco appreciates cms offering a 2019 participation option. offering a july 1, 2019 start date provides an opportunity for acos to begin or continue their participation in the program. while the timing will present challenges, such as a compressed timeline to analyze program changes, review application materials, make decisions regarding participation and gather all of the required information to submit applications, it is critical that cms continue to offer a participation option for 2019. bidco has concerns regarding complexity caused by the introduction of two, six-month performance periods with some acos operating under current program rules and others operating under new program rules. we request that cms clarify how such details will be handled (please see our detailed comments below under \u00e2\u0080\u009cassessing six-month performance periods in 2019\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\n in addition, we urge cms to provide acos with agreements expiring in 2018 the option of extending their current participation agreements from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019. providing this option would give acos additional time to analyze program changes and prepare for the application process while reducing complexity. cms must also provide acos with opportunities to add and delete participants throughout the performance periods offered in 2019 and clarify when such opportunities will be permitted.\n bidco supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to define acos re-entering or renewing. however, we disagree with the proposal to limit participation options for acos with any experience in performance-based risk models. particularly in cases where the aco may have only participated in such a model for one performance year, we do not feel it is justified to limit an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation to either the basic level e or enhanced track options. additionally, as noted previously in this comment letter, the levels of risk required for the enhanced track are a large jump from those required in basic level e. given this dramatic increase, cms should not force acos to participate in the enhanced track. instead, we recommend cms only limit an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation to basic level e if such aco had completed at least one agreement period in a performance-based risk model. further, and echoed in our comments above on the proposed high/low revenue distinction, we do not support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to require high-revenue acos with experience in performance-based risk models to participate in the enhanced track. in fact, we urge cms not to finalize the arbitrary distinction of high- and low-revenue acos, and we oppose requirements that high-revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or any acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e.\n\n11. assessing six-month performance periods in 2019 \n key comments: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco appreciates cms proposals to offer aco participation options in 2019. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed policies governing how shared savings and losses will be calculated for the six-month performance periods in 2019, however, cms must clarify and provide additional education to acos concerning how certain operational details will be addressed. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 cms must clarify how quality reporting would take place for six-month performance periods that will be based on 12 months of data and how such reporting will be considered in mips.\n\n\n\n\n\n 28\n month period separately for purposes of calculating financial and quality performance. these calculations would be reconciled based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance during the entire 12-month calendar year, but cms would prorate the calendar year shared savings or losses based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance during the applicable six-month period.\n january 1, 2019 to june 30, 2019\n assignment window for acos under preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation, the assignment window would be calendar year 2019. for acos under prospective assignment, cms proposes the assignment window would be october 1, 2017 through september 30, 2018, with beneficiaries remaining prospectively assigned to the aco at the end of calendar year 2019 unless the beneficiary meets certain exclusion criteria. lastly, beneficiary assignment would be based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certified aco participant list for the agreement period beginning january 1, 2019.\n benchmark cms proposes to calculate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark and assigned beneficiary expenditures as though the six-month performance year were the entire calendar year. the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark would be determined according to the applicable methodology of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s track and agreement with cms, except that data from the entire calendar year 2019 would be used in place of data for the six-month performance year for the benchmarking approaches cms currently uses to update and adjust historical benchmarks. thus, the existing methodology would be used to determine the benchmark for the january 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 june 30, 2019 performance year by performing the following calculations: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 benchmarks would be adjusted for changes in severity and case mix between benchmark year three and calendar year 2019 using the current hcc risk score and demographic factors methodology; and \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 benchmarks would be updated to calendar year 2019 according to the methodology for using growth in either national or regional medicare ffs expenditures, depending on whether the aco is in its first or second agreement period and whether the second agreement period began in 2016 or 2017\u00e2\u0080\u00932019.\n financial performance cms would apply the methodology for determining shared savings and losses according to the track the aco is participating in on january 1, 2019, with the following exceptions to the applicable methodology implemented to calculate the expenditures for assigned beneficiaries over the full calendar year for purposes of determining the shared savings and losses for the six-month performance year: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 average per capita medicare parts a and b services expenditures for calendar year 2019 would be calculated for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance year assigned beneficiary population; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms would compare the expenditures to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark, determined for calendar year 2019 as listed above; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms would apply the msr or mlr, if applicable; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms would prorate any amounts of shared savings or losses by multiplying those amounts by 50 percent, which represents the portion of the calendar year covered by the six-month performance year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 29\n quality performance for acos participating in tracks where shared savings or losses are affected by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance, cms would multiply the difference between the updated benchmark expenditures by the applicable msr or mlr based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance.\n july 1, 2019 to december 31, 2019\n cms proposes to apply the same general methodological steps for calculating prorated shared savings and losses as described above for the six-month performance year from january 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 june 30, 2019, except where the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreement and track stipulates a different methodology, for example, the benchmarking methodology or financial calculations specific to the track in which the aco participates.\n comments: bidco supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed policies governing how shared savings and losses will be calculated for the six-month performance periods in 2019. we support cms providing acos with an option to participate in 2019, however, we note there is significant complexity introduced as a result. therefore, we urge cms to provide additional guidance and education to acos clarifying how six-month performance periods will be managed, for example, when participant list changes will be permitted, if there will be any disruptions in claims files and performance data provided to acos and how acos should modify participation agreements for the 2019 performance periods. additionally, cms must clarify how quality reporting will take place for six-month performance periods that cms states will be based on 12 months of data. in the proposed rule, cms notes the agency would use the certified aco participant list for the performance year starting on july 1, 2019, to determine the quality reporting samples for the 2019 reporting period for certain acos (acos that enter an agreement period beginning on july 1, 2019, including new acos, and acos that extended their prior participation agreement for the six-month performance year from january 1, 2019, to june 30, 2019, as well as acos that start a 12-month performance year on january 1, 2019, and terminate their participation agreement with an effective date of termination of june 30, 2019, and enter a new agreement period beginning on july 1, 2019). if an aco extends its participation to the first six months of 2019 but does not enter a new agreement period beginning on july 1, 2019, cms proposes to use the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest certified participant list (the aco participant list effective on january 1, 2019) to determine the quality reporting samples for the 2019 reporting period. beneficiary assignment for purposes of generating the quality reporting samples would be based on the assignment methodology applicable to the aco during its six-month performance year. given this, we assume all acos would only be responsible for reporting quality one time, during the typical january to march timeframe following the performance year. cms must clarify how such quality reporting will take place. cms must also clarify how such quality reporting will satisfy mips quality reporting requirements for acos subject to mips.\n\n12. beneficiary assignment changes  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 we urge cms to reconsider its proposal to include specialists in the voluntary alignment process when a beneficiary elects such a professional as their primary care clinician, if the beneficiary does not receive primary care services from an aco professional in the aco. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco opposes cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed introduction of a new optional assignment method, the beneficiary opt-in assignment methodology, and instead we urge cms to improve upon the current voluntary alignment process by creating an automated system to support this assignment methodology.\n proposals: cms proposes to revise the definition of primary care services to include the following healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) and current procedural terminology (cpt) codes: (1) advance care planning service codes, cpt codes 99497 and 99498; (2) administration of health risk assessment service codes, cpt codes 96160 and 96161; (3) prolonged evaluation and management or psychotherapy service(s) beyond the typical service time of the primary procedure, cpt codes 99354 and 99355; (4) annual depression screening service code, hcpcs code g0444; (5) alcohol misuse screening service code, hcpcs code g0442; and (6) alcohol misuse counseling service code, hcpcs code g0443. in addition, if finalized as proposed in the 2019 mpfs proposed rule, cms would add these three new hcpcs codes to the mssp assignment methodology: (1) gpc1x add-on code, for the visit complexity inherent to evaluation and management associated with certain primary care services; (2) gcg0x add-on code, for visit complexity inherent to evaluation and management associated with endocrinology, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, urology, neurology, obstetrics/gynecology, allergy/immunology, otolaryngology, or interventional pain management-centered care; and (3) gpro1, an additional add-on code for prolonged evaluation and management or psychotherapy services beyond the typical service time of the primary procedure.\n cms also proposes to allow acos to elect a new \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeneficiary opt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d methodology that would be supplemented by a modified claims-based assignment and voluntary alignment. the opt-in assignment would be based on an affirmative recognition of the relationship between the beneficiary and the aco. the \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach would be supplemented with a modified claims-based assignment approach that focuses on the most complex patients by assigning beneficiaries to the aco with seven or more primary care service visits from aco clinicians. additionally, beneficiaries who choose voluntary alignment would be considered in this new assignment methodology. cms would allow, but not require, acos to elect the opt-in-based assignment methodology at the time of application to enter or renew participation. cms proposes if an aco chooses not to elect the opt-in-based assignment methodology during the application or renewal process, beneficiaries would continue to be assigned to the aco based on the existing assignment methodology (i.e., claims-based assignment with voluntary alignment). cms is considering but not formally proposing to discontinue the existing assignment methodology and applying the opt-in-based assignment program-wide. cms also clarifies that this proposal would have no effect on the voluntary alignment process that exists currently.\n additionally, cms proposes to provide more flexibility in choosing prospective or retrospective assignment for basic and enhanced acos, as required by the balanced budget act (bba). specifically, for acos entering agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years, cms proposes to allow acos annually to elect the beneficiary assignment methodology (i.e., preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation or prospective assignment) to apply for each remaining performance year within their agreement period. cms also proposes to provide an opportunity for acos to switch their selection of beneficiary assignment methodology on an annual basis, which would be done prior to the start of a new performance year.\n\n\n\n\n\n 31\n finally, as required by the bba, cms proposes adjustments to the voluntary alignment process. cms proposes to modify current policies to assign a beneficiary to an aco based upon his or her selection of any aco professional, regardless of specialty, as his or her primary clinician. under this proposal, a beneficiary may select a practitioner with any specialty designation as his or her primary care provider and be eligible for voluntary alignment assignment to the aco in which the practitioner is an aco professional. currently the aco professional designated by the beneficiary must be a primary care physician as defined at \u00e2\u00a7425.20, a physician with a specialty designation included at \u00e2\u00a7425.402(c), or a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist. cms proposes to use a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designation to align the beneficiary to the aco in which his or her primary clinician participates even if the beneficiary does not receive primary care services from an aco professional in that aco. cms proposes that the agency will not assign a beneficiary to the aco when the beneficiary is also eligible for assignment to an entity participating in a model tested or expanded under section 1115a of the act under which claims-based assignment is based solely on claims for services other than primary care services and for which there has been a determination by secretary that a waiver is necessary solely for purposes of testing the model.\n comments: bidco supports the proposal to modify the definition of primary care services to include additional services if finalized as proposed in the 2019 mpfs proposed rule. assignment is a critical program methodology that determines the beneficiary population for which an aco is held accountable. cms should continue to refine the primary care codes used in assignment to ensure the list used for acos is consistent with current billing practices. bidco also strongly supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to provide acos with more flexibility in selecting a prospective or retrospective assignment methodology on an annual basis, and we urge cms to finalize this proposal.\n bidco has concerns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals to modify the voluntary alignment process to include specialists in the voluntary assignment process if the beneficiary elects such a professional as his/her primary clinician. specifically, we have concerns regarding unintended consequences of this policy, and we request cms not finalize this proposal. we recommend, at a minimum, if cms finalizes its proposal to include specialists in the voluntary alignment process it use an approach that overrides the existing claims-based assignment methodology only when a beneficiary has at least one qualified primary care service (based on the existing services used for mssp assignment) during the previous or current performance year with an aco professional as defined under step 1 or step 2 of mssp assignment.\n bidco also opposes cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed introduction of a new, optional assignment method, the beneficiary opt-in assignment methodology. we have concerns regarding the complexity introduced by this methodology and request cms instead focus its attention on improving the voluntary alignment methodology which remains underutilized. unlike medicare advantage, acos cannot restrict a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice of provider. additionally, the retrospective aco patient attribution process is such that an aco does not know which patients are ultimately attributed to the aco until after the performance period has ended. therefore, the aco must employ strategies to coordinate the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care regardless of whether the patient may or may not be attributed to the aco and despite the fact that the patient may ultimately choose a low-performing provider outside of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s network to receive certain portions of his or her care. this makes the model one of the most consumer-directed population health models cms deploys.\n\n\n\n\n\n 32\n to determine quality and cost metrics for the aco. this results in acos treating all patients as potentially included in their aco and results in high quality, coordinated care for all beneficiaries. the current voluntary patient alignment option launched in 2017 has been underutilized and creates confusion among beneficiaries. we urge cms not to finalize the new beneficiary opt-in approach and continue to make any patient alignment options voluntary.\n bidco was pleased that cms finalized its decision to incorporate voluntary alignment in the final 2017 mpfs. however, as this option was only introduced beginning with performance year 2018, there are several areas cms must improve on to increase use of the option by beneficiaries. the functionality to designate a primary clinician was added to the mymedicare.gov website in june 2017. if a beneficiary has existing favorite clinicians from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy health\u00e2\u0080\u009d web page on mymedicare.gov, he or she can select \u00e2\u0080\u009cadd as my primary clinician.\u00e2\u0080\u009d if a beneficiary does not have a mymedicare.gov account, one must be created. beneficiaries can receive assistance with mymedicare.gov, including help to set up an account and/or designate a primary clinician by calling 1-800-medicare (1-800-633-4227). the my medicare help page notes that a primary clinician is the health care provider that a beneficiary believes is responsible for coordinating his or her overall care. once a beneficiary aligns to a qualifying clinician in an aco, he or she will be assigned to that aco until he or she removes the clinician as primary practitioner or he or she no longer meets the beneficiary eligibility assignment requirements or the requirements necessary for voluntary alignment. this process can be cumbersome and time consuming for beneficiaries unfamiliar with cms website. we recommend cms modify the voluntary alignment process by allowing beneficiaries to make this designation over the phone by calling the 1-800-medicare or through the physician compare website. we also request cms include more information in beneficiary communications about the importance of this designation and the role acos play in providing high- quality, coordinated and efficient care. we urge cms to implement these changes and to consult with acos as the agency works to further improve the voluntary alignment process.\n\n13. payment rule waivers \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 33\n provide waived co-payments for primary care services provided by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s providers to encourage patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use of these services.\n proposals: cms proposes, beginning july 1, 2019, to expand eligibility for the snf three-day rule waiver to include acos participating in a two-sided model under preliminary prospective assignment. the snf three-day rule waiver would be available for such acos with respect to all beneficiaries who have been identified as preliminarily prospectively assigned to the aco on the initial performance year assignment list or on one or more assignment lists for quarters 1, 2, and 3 of the performance year for snf services provided after the beneficiary first appeared on one of the assignment lists for the applicable performance year. cms also clarifies that, for purposes of determining eligibility to partner with an aco for the snf three-day rule waiver, snfs include providers furnishing snf services under swing bed arrangements. in these instances, the three-star quality rating requirement would be waived.\n cms also proposes beginning with performance years 2020 and beyond, the agency would treat the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home as an originating site and not apply the originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services furnished by a physician or practitioner participating in an applicable aco. cms proposes to apply these policies to acos under a two-sided model that participate under the prospective assignment method, not a preliminary prospective assignment method.\n comments: bidco strongly supports cms proposals to expand access to certain payment rule waivers for acos participating in performance-based risk models. these tools serve as critical patient engagement tools necessary for success. we urge cms to finalize its proposal to expand eligibility for the snf three-day rule waiver to include acos participating in a two-sided model under preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation. we also appreciate the proposal to include snf services furnished under swing bed arrangements, as this proposal addresses concerns of acos in rural areas that have fewer available snfs. while we support these changes, we also urge cms to streamline the current snf waiver process that is burdensome and therefore results in fewer acos using the waiver. specifically, we recommend cms alter the current requirements that the patient has been evaluated and approved for admission to the snf within three days prior to the snf admission by an aco provider/supplier that is a physician, consistent with the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficiary evaluation and admission plan. instead, we urge cms to also allow other qualified health care professionals to evaluate the patient and approve the admission to the snf. requiring a physician to see the patient is arbitrary and results in unnecessary delays that do not improve patient care. further, snf affiliates must have and maintain an overall rating of three stars or higher under the cms five-star quality rating system. as a result, acos must currently continually look up a snf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality rating which is time consuming and adds significant burden. under the bundled payments for care improvement advanced (bpci-a) program, cms provides by email an xls file to participants with a list of snfs that are approved by cms to participate in the three-day rule waiver available in bpci-a. we recommend cms take a similar approach with acos to minimize burden associated with the current process.\n bidco also supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand certain telehealth waivers to treat the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home as an originating site and not apply the originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services furnished by a practitioner participating in two-sided aco models. however, we urge cms to implement such proposal effective july 1, 2019, consistent with the proposals for the expansion of the snf waiver, to increase access and use of the waiver by acos. acos consider telehealth a crucial tool for improving care coordination and reducing costs. in addition to these waivers, we urge cms to consider adding other critical patient engagement tools for acos, as detailed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 34\n allowing npi-level participation/network management\n if cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal is to enable acos to have greater control over managing costs for their assigned beneficiaries, cms should provide acos with the ability to select only the highest performing providers by allowing acos to select their participants by npi rather than solely at the tin level. cms should give acos the flexibility to build a high-performing network of providers who will deliver the most efficient and highest quality care by allowing participation by a subset of providers in a tin, and each individual provider used in assignment could only be in one aco. this would allow acos to carefully create networks of high-performing providers, including those participating in the aco and those outside the aco with whom the aco has a preferred provider relationship. creating these high-performing networks will incentivize providers that want to join or remain in an aco to focus more on reducing unnecessary costs and maintaining high quality. this would also incentivize acos to more closely evaluate providers in their network based on sophisticated data analytics. acos should be allowed the flexibility to negotiate discounted ffs contracts with preferred providers without the burden of the aco having to process claims themselves. introducing this type of network management is essential to allow acos to successfully assume accountability for their patient population. providers with relationships with the aco would be more likely to share care coordination data to more effectively manage patient care as a team, and the aco would communicate with these providers about the cost and quality implications of their care decisions.\n allowing acos to establish post-acute care networks\n cms does not currently allow acos to encourage patients to seek care from providers the aco has identified as most efficient and high quality. unlike the ma program, acos are unable to provide incentives for beneficiary engagement with the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most efficient providers. this in turn creates challenges for the aco in communicating with beneficiaries regarding their preferred providers for treatment. these are the providers engaged with the aco and focused on providing coordinated, high- quality care. bidco recommends cms allow acos the same opportunities that are currently provided to ma plans to increase beneficiary engagement through incentives for beneficiaries choosing high-quality, efficient providers that work collaboratively with the aco, particularly for post-acute care providers to ensure aco patients receive the highest quality care. in order to facilitate this request, cms must also provide more transparency around post-acute care admissions and quality metrics for post-acute care providers.\n providing acos upfront funding for transportation services\n\n\n\n\n\n 35\n\n post-discharge home visits and primary care co-payments\n additionally, we urge cms to waive certain post-discharge home visit supervision requirements to allow for broader use of these services by acos when clinically appropriate. we ask that cms allow physicians to contract with licensed clinicians to provide these home visit services using general instead of direct supervision requirements specified at 42 cfr \u00e2\u00a7 410.32(b)(3). this will provide all acos with needed flexibility during the critical post-discharge time period. finally, we ask cms to afford all acos with the ability to provide waived co-payments for primary care services provided by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s providers to encourage patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use of these critical services. cms should afford all acos with every opportunity for success in reducing costs for their patients by allowing acos to use these high-value services, and we request that these waivers apply to all acos participating in performance-based risk models.\n providing acos upfront funding for social services\n there is increasing evidence that social determinants are a greater driver of cost and outcomes than genetics or clinical care. currently there is little financial incentive or infrastructure to pay for social determinants of health (sdoh) work or to support community agencies that work on sdoh initiatives. few acos have found ways to effectively connect their work to closure of sdoh gaps, but those that have, have been able to demonstrate significant cost reductions and shared savings while improving quality of care. this funding could help acos with coordination of social resources as well as allow acos to align with the work of community partners that close sdoh gaps. innovations then could come from not only the healthcare delivery side, such as building community networks, referral systems for sdoh gaps, and screening for sdoh gaps, but also from financing of community agencies. bidco recommends cms provide acos participating in performance-based risk models with upfront funding to pay for such closure gaps. specifically, bidco recommends cms provide existing acos with funds similar to the accountable care organization investment model (aim) program, providing targeted advanced loan payments to acos to provide such services.\n\n14. quality changes \n\n key comments: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco strongly supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to remove aco measure 11 and instead rely on attestation to evaluate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of certified electronic health record technology (cehrt). \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 we urge cms to clarify that acos subject to the mips would not be required to report promoting interoperability (pi) and would instead see pi performance category weights redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative and asks that cms consider not only whether a measure is a process measure, but also whether the measure is considered a low-value process measure, before removing from aco quality measure sets. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to consider the addition of opioid use measures for potential inclusion in aco quality measure sets in future program years, and we recommend certain changes to such measures as detailed below. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 we urge cms to exclude mips bonuses from aco expenditures.\n\n\n\n\n\n 36\n proposals: cms proposes to discontinue use of the quality measure 11 that assesses an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligible clinicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 level of adoption of cehrt. instead, cms proposes that for performance years starting on january 1, 2019 and subsequent performance years, acos must attest and certify upon application to participate in the mssp that at least 50 percent of the eligible clinicians participating in the aco use cehrt to document and communicate clinical care to their patients or other health care providers. acos would be required to submit this certification in the form and manner specified by cms.\n cms also seeks feedback on ways to reduce burden and focus on meaningful quality measures as part of their meaningful measures initiative. under this initiative, cms states it is working towards assessing performance on only those core issues that are most vital to providing high-quality care and improving patient outcomes with an emphasis on outcome-based measures, reducing unnecessary burden on providers, and putting patients first.\n finally, cms is also considering the addition of one or more measures specific to opioid use to the aco quality measures set. the potential benefits of such policies would be to focus acos on the appropriate use of opioids for their assigned beneficiaries and support their opioid misuse prevention efforts. specifically, cms is considering the following relevant national quality forum (nqf)-endorsed measures with emphasis on medicare individuals with part d coverage who are 18 years or older without cancer or enrolled in hospice: nqf 2940, use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer; nqf 2950, use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer; nqf 2951, use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer.\n comments: bidco strongly supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to remove aco measure 11 and instead rely on attestation to evaluate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of cehrt. we appreciate cms responding to requests to remove this measure and as a result rely on attestations as is done in the next generation aco model. we ask cms to clarify that acos subject to mips would not be required to report pi and would instead see pi performance category weights redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories. we agree that removal of this measure will reduce significant regulatory burdens; acos subject to mips (basic track levels a through d as proposed) should not be unfairly excluded from this policy. all acos demonstrate a commitment to use ehrs, including acos in models not categorized as advanced apms. we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative and, in this role, we feel cms must also look to reduce the regulatory burden on acos to comply with mips requirements to the fullest extent possible. this includes making all program criteria and scoring methodologies for acos specifically accessible and transparent.\n as cms looks to future quality measure changes for acos, we urge the agency to consider not only whether a measure is considered a process measure but also what relative value the measure provides, when considering the burden associated with data collection and reporting of the measure. further, as cms considers annual measure changes, we note that each measure change results in administrative costs, such as changing work flows and ehrs for data collection and reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n 37\n multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer. we recommend changes to nqf 2940; this measure should instead align with the centers for disease control and prevention guidelines identifying patients for whom opioid prescriptions exceed 90 morphine milligram equivalents. it is important to include these measures on dose and duration of opioids prescribed. however, we urge cms to initially make such measures pay-for-reporting only as the measures are further refined with stakeholder input for use in the aco program.\n finally, we urge cms to exclude mips bonuses as aco expenditures. the current cms policy unfairly punishes acos for their high performance by both requiring track 1 acos (and basic levels a, b, c and d as proposed) to participate in mips, excluding such acos from advanced apm bonuses and counting any mips bonuses earned for high performance in that program as aco expenditures. cms currently excludes advanced apm bonuses from aco expenditures and we reiterate our request for cms do the same for mips expenditures. this will be increasingly important over time as mips bonuses are projected to rise in future program years. while aggregate program data has not yet been made available by cms, many acos have already reported perfect or nearly perfect scores in mips for 2017. these bonuses will then count against the aco when expenditures are calculated for purposes of mssp calculations. therefore, the better an aco and its eligible clinicians perform in mips, the greater they will be penalized when calculating shared savings/losses for the aco. this is an unfair and untenable policy. although cms argues that the agency has maintained this policy under the value-based payment modifier program, bidco believes cms has the authority and ability to remove mips expenditures from aco benchmark calculations. in fact, cms does make claim-level adjustments by adding sequestration costs back to paid amounts when calculating aco expenditures. it was not the intent of congress to penalize acos in mips, and therefore cms must alter this policy.\n\n15. beneficiary incentive program \n\n key comments: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a beneficiary incentive program for certain acos. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 we urge cms provide the necessary funding for the beneficiary incentive program, as is done in the next generation aco program.\n proposals: cms proposes to allow any aco in track 2, levels c, d, or e of the basic track, or the enhanced track to establish a cms-approved beneficiary incentive program to provide incentive payments to eligible beneficiaries who receive qualifying services. as required by the bba, cms proposes a $20 payment limit, updated annually consistent with the consumer price index and rounded to the nearest dollar, and made no later than 30 days after the service. a beneficiary would be eligible to receive an incentive payment if the beneficiary is assigned to an aco through either preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation or prospective assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n 38\n\n cms proposes that incentive payments made by an aco shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating benchmarks, estimated average per capita medicare expenditures, and shared savings. cms also proposes to disregard incentive payments made by an aco for purposes of calculating shared losses. lastly, cms proposes a requirement that acos publicly report for each performance year the total number of beneficiaries who receive an incentive payment, the total number of incentive payments furnished, hcpcs codes associated with any qualifying payment for which an incentive payment was furnished, the total value of all incentive payments furnished, and the total type of each incentive payment (e.g., check or debit card) furnished.\n comments: bidco supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a beneficiary incentive program for certain acos. as discussed above, such patient engagement tools are critical to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to better manage patient care. while we support this proposal, we have concerns with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to implementation, which would require the aco fully fund the costs of such a program. there are numerous upfront costs required to establish and maintain an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations. acos invest these dollars to support the model and efforts to transform patient care, sometimes never realizing these investment costs. acos that earn shared savings do not see such funds until years after the upfront investments have been made. therefore, it is unreasonable to expect the aco to fully fund the costs of such a program, and we urge cms instead provide such funding as is the case in the next generation aco program. at a minimum, cms should consider funding the program for the first year to support the cost of running such a program.\n\n16. beneficiary notification requirements  \n\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 bidco disagrees with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assumption that the current beneficiary notification process is underutilized, and we urge cms to maintain the current beneficiary notification process. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we recommend cms instead simplify marketing requirements to allow acos the flexibility to communicate more effectively with patients about the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n 39\n requirement to ensure beneficiaries have a sufficient opportunity to be informed about the program and how it may affect their care and data. cms also notes concern that the existing information on the program is provided to patients in separate resources, which may be time consuming for beneficiaries to compile and may be underutilized.\n bidco disagrees with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assumption that the current beneficiary notification process is underutilized, and we urge cms to maintain the current beneficiary notification process. while cms states its proposal mitigates burdens on acos by proposing acos use a template notification provided by cms, bidco notes that previously cms-provided template language was confusing to patients. this confusion prompted numerous calls and questions, and it distracted clinicians from providing patient care. as a more effective alternative, we recommend cms maintain current beneficiary notification requirements and allow acos increased flexibility to communicate with patients about the program using methods, such as including language on aco websites as well as phone-recorded messages. currently, aco communication to beneficiaries is limited due to unnecessary marketing requirements preventing communication with a patient. these requirements inhibit an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to explain the benefits and services provided by acos. cms must allow acos to invest resources in the ways the organization finds most effective. this requirement is unnecessary and therefore a drain on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s limited resources. bidco urges cms to not finalize its proposals and instead focus on simplifying aco marketing requirements to provide acos with more flexibility in communicating effectively with the patients and community they serve.\n\n17. repayment mechanisms \n\n key comments: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco urges cms to remove the requirement for tail period coverage and to lower the repayment mechanism amounts for basic track levels c, d and e. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand the acceptable institutions providing a repayment mechanism to include any insured institution, including credit unions. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco supports using the most recent data available to establish a repayment mechanism amount, requests cms increase the threshold that would trigger a higher repayment mechanism amount and provide symmetry by allowing decreases in repayment mechanism amounts during an agreement period. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 bidco requests that cms provide new repayment mechanisms, including reinstating reinsurance and introducing an option for a future withhold of medicare payments.\n proposals: as with current risk-based models, acos in the revised mssp would be required to demonstrate their ability to repay losses by establishing a sufficient repayment mechanism, including funds placed in escrow, a letter of credit, a surety bond, or a combination of those mechanisms. the agency proposes to expand the acceptable institutions providing a repayment mechanism to include any insured institution, including credit unions. the agency also proposes to extend the duration of the repayment mechanism, which would need to be in place for the number of risk-based years in the agreement period plus an additional 24 months of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctail coverage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms proposes to use the most recent calendar year having 12 months of available data to establish the repayment mechanism amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n 40\n (benchmark-based standard). the agency notes its efforts to minimize administrative burdens by proposing that acos with a repayment mechanism would be permitted to extend its duration for the basic or enhanced tracks. in the event that any of the following occur, cms proposes that the repayment mechanism may be terminated:\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 shared losses have been fully repaid for all performance years; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 cms has exhausted the amount; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 cms determines that shared losses are not owed.\n comments: securing a repayment mechanism is a regulatory burden, which is time consuming and costly for acos. many acos cite the burden and cost of securing a repayment mechanism as reasons not to move to a risk-based aco model. instead of requiring a repayment mechanism that pays banks and brokers and takes money away from the aco executing its core mission of improving patient care, we urge cms to remove the repayment mechanism requirement when an aco can prove that it has an investor or financial backer with a demonstrated high credit rating. financial backers could include outside investors, insurers or hospitals or health systems that are involved with the aco and providing financial support, which would be available should losses occur. this assurance would protect the medicare trust fund in the event an aco has losses while avoiding the financial inefficiency and regulatory burden of involving outside financial institutions as third parties that benefit from the repayment mechanism requirements. this would also eliminate the need to have a 24-month \u00e2\u0080\u009ctail period.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n the additional burden of a 24-month \u00e2\u0080\u009ctail period\u00e2\u0080\u009d heightens concerns and increases financial requirements for acos.  should cms maintain requirements for a repayment mechanism, we request the agency to minimize this regulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for tail period coverage, which is especially important considering the longer agreement periods cms proposes. should the agency retain a tail period, we also urge the agency to ensure that cms is equally liable to pay for additional shared savings if discovered up to 24 months following the agreement period and this should be noted in the mssp participation agreements.\n we further recommend cms reduce the repayment mechanism requirements, especially for the lower risk basic track levels c, d and e. for these levels, cms should only require a guarantee equal to 0.5 percent of total benchmark expenditures or 1 percent of ffs revenue.  those amounts are sufficient to prompt third-party due diligence and establish credit worthiness within the probable range of shared losses. this reduction makes sense especially in light of the 30 percent loss sharing rate in these levels that correspondingly reduces the likelihood of net losses.\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand the acceptable institutions providing a repayment mechanism to include any insured institution, including credit unions. this would provide more options than the current requirement to only utilize federal deposit insurance corporation-insured institutions. allowing access to credit unions may provide more economical alternatives and increase market competition, which could potentially lower the overall cost of accessing repayment mechanisms. we recommend cms finalize this expansion of acceptable institutions as proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n 41\n mechanism amount would be increased by cms. in other words, any increases over $100,000 would trigger a higher amount. this threshold is too low and should be raised to avoid acos having to secure larger repayment mechanisms. further, while cms proposes details related to increasing the amount of the repayment mechanism, it is proposed that repayment mechanism amounts cannot decrease within an agreement period. it is unfair to hold acos accountable for increases without allowing them to benefit from decreases, and we urge cms to revise its policy to also allow for decreases to repayment mechanism amounts. we also urge cms to provide flexibility for acos that may need to adjust their repayment mechanisms over time. for example, we request the agency work with acos to provide flexibility to release funds for a limited window, such as 60 days, for acos changing repayment mechanisms. updating repayment mechanisms may happen over time as a result of organizational changes, needs, and availability of specific repayment mechanisms.\n we also request that cms provide new repayment mechanisms, including reinstating reinsurance and introducing an option for a future withhold of medicare payments as repayment mechanisms. we request cms restore reinsurance as a qualifying repayment mechanism, which it was until cms removed it in the june 2015 final mssp rule. the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rationale for doing so was that few acos were using this option. however, we question that logic considering how few risk-bearing acos there were at that time. further, despite limited initial use of reinsurance for demonstrating ability to repay losses to cms, this continues to be an option which some acos pursue separate from their cms obligations. therefore, we see no harm in cms reinstating reinsurance as an option, and we urge cms to do so for all two-sided aco tracks/models.\n under the macra financial risk standards, the agency may allow a reduction of payment rates to the apm entity and/or the apm entity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligible clinicians as one option for repaying losses. we urge cms to develop an option for acos to repay losses through reduced payment rates of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligible clinicians in future years. through this mechanism, cms would identify the tin/npi combinations that participate in the aco for a specific performance period and, similar to downward payment adjustments under mips, cms would reduce the payment rates for those tin/npis by a certain percent in a future payment adjustment year to recoup the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s losses. acos would include language in the agreement between the aco and its participant tins and their individual practitioners detailing specifics of this repayment mechanism. allowing acos to choose this as one of the mechanisms to repay losses would provide a new option that some acos may prefer over repaying losses in a lump sum. we urge cms to work collaboratively with us to further develop this concept and the key details that would be needed to implement it.\n\n18. extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 42\n discharge which could be added to claims after the impact of a natural disaster.\n proposal: cms previously established policies beginning with performance year 2017 and every year that follows, for using an alternative approach to calculate acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cost and quality performance if deemed affected by an \u00e2\u0080\u009cextreme and uncontrollable circumstance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms seeks feedback on this policy.\n comments: we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughtful analysis and proposals related to accounting for the impact of a natural disaster on an impacted aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shared losses and quality. since cms proposes a more aggressive transition to risk, these policies are even more critical to protect acos unfairly harmed by expenses and quality changes beyond their control as a result of a natural disaster. as acos have been impacted by several natural disasters in recent years, more data are available to deeply analyze the effect of such extreme and uncontrollable circumstances on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations.\n in 2017, cms introduced an interim final rule containing a policy for extreme and uncontrollable circumstances for acos. unfortunately, this policy went through the formal commenting period before affected acos received their performance results to understand the true extent of the impact of such disasters on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations. since introducing such policies, acos have had more experiences with natural disasters and therefore experience with how such events affect an aco. based on this experience, we recommend several changes to the current extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy.\n trend rate without changes to the current policy, natural disasters will negatively affect mssp acos and therefore affect the long-term sustainability of the program and the medicare trust fund. the current policy prorates shared losses by multiplying the shared losses by two factors: the percentage of the total months in the performance year affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance and the beneficiaries who reside in an area affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance. this adequately addresses acos that are expected to have shared losses based on performance prior to a natural disaster and have increased shared losses after a natural disaster. however, the current policy does not address an increase in annual per capita expense as compared to the benchmark/msr/mlr. this point is particularly sensitive around msr and mlr values where very small changes can have large or 100 percent impact on shared savings or shared losses when either the msr or mlr is exceeded.\n the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current policy relies on \u00e2\u0080\u009cuse of natural disaster payment modifiers\u00e2\u0080\u009d to allow mssp acos to identify whether a claim would have been denied under normal medicare ffs rules. there is no evidence to support that part a providers were or are aware of such natural disaster codes or were using them compliantly. additionally, there is no policy to use them to account for unsafe place of discharge which creates a longer length of stay. we believe that there is a current disparity between cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectation of compliance with disaster payment modifiers and the current use of such codes (see additional comments below regarding use of natural disaster codes). due to these limitations of the current policy, we instead recommend that cms revise the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy to provide a trend/growth rate that is the higher of the national assignable rate or the regional rate. further, the regional rate should be calculated by excluding the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries. studies have shown that natural disasters materially increase medicare costs per beneficiary. for example a recent bmc health services research article, disaster impacts on cost and utilization of medicare, shows annual standardized cost per beneficiary increased 7.6% from the mean in the counties most severely impacted by these events (feb. 7, 2018. see table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 43\n quality performance scores natural disasters can have a significant negative impact on both aco process and outcomes measure scores. as an example, for process measures it is not uncommon during a disaster for scheduled annual wellness visits to be canceled due either to clinic closure or beneficiary evacuation. in some instances, these visits are not subsequently rescheduled which leads to missed opportunities to provide preventive care and identify emerging issues that require care coordination. the current cms policy awards an average quality score to those affected by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, which can unfairly penalize high-performing acos. instead we recommend cms use an approach similar to the policy currently used in the ma program and award a quality score that is the greater of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality score for the affected performance year, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prior year quality score, or the national mean quality score. for acos that are in their first year, cms should award a quality score that is the greater of their actual quality score for the affected performance year or the national mean quality score. we also strongly recommend cms expand its policy related to aco quality scores negatively affected by a natural disaster to include all acos, not just those who cannot report quality data. we believe that acos whose scores on either the all-cause readmissions measure (aco-8) or the snf readmissions measure (aco-35) fall below the 30th percentile should be eligible to have their quality score adjusted to account for the natural disaster.\n introducing ways to more accurately account for impact of natural disasters bidco believes it is difficult to fully and accurately use the natural disaster payment modifiers to appropriately capture the negative impact of the event on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance. after hurricane katrina, natural disaster payment modifiers were introduced in 2005. in 2012, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisaster related\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ccatastrophe related\u00e2\u0080\u009d condition codes were made mandatory for any claim for which medicare payment is conditioned on the presence of a formal waiver. this institutional code enables acute and post-acute facilities to use these payment modifier codes for claims submission and payment where the billing would otherwise be out of compliance (e.g., ordering replacement durable medical equipment for a patient). we believe these codes are not being used as cms has intended. additionally, the codes do not allow for capturing instances of \u00e2\u0080\u0098unsafe place of discharge\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which is common during a natural disaster. furthermore, the timing of the claims submission during a natural disaster does not lend itself to accurate use of the modifiers. at the time of an extreme event or natural disaster, a facility is working tirelessly to address the patient surge, to transfer patients who have clinical needs that cannot be met under emergency operating conditions, and to meet a myriad of other community needs. training health system providers to use these codes is not common. given the infrequent nature of these events providers focus their scarce training resources for revenue cycle staff to remain in compliance with medicare and medicaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever- evolving billing regulations. therefore, at a time when providers are pushed beyond capacity to manage patient care during emergencies, there is no routine revenue cycle workflow to ensure the disaster modifiers are accurately assigned. only in instances where a biller knows a claim is out of compliance for payment may the workflow to add the code be triggered. therefore, we feel the definition of these modifiers must be expanded or new natural disaster payment modifiers should be created with proper education to help isolate the extreme or uncontrollable events by claim or beneficiary during a natural disaster. bidco feels this would be a more accurate approach to analyzing impacts of extreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster.\n conclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n 44\n and it is essential to have the right balance of risk and reward to continue program growth and success. program changes that deter new entrants would shut off a pipeline of beginner acos that should be encouraged to embark on the journey to value, which is a long-standing bipartisan goal of the administration and congress and important aspect of the qpp. we urge the agency to consider the feedback outlined in this letter.

organizations\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6pathways to success\n dear administrator verma:\n\n thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed changes to the medicare shared savings program (mssp). we believe that value-based care is a roadmap to sustainability for independent practice, and are pleased that the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) proposed changes that recognize the successes of physician-led accountable care organizations (acos).\n\n the partnership to empower physician-led care (pepc) is a membership organization dedicated to supporting value-based care to reduce costs, improve quality, empower patients and physicians, and increase access to care for millions of americans through a competitive health care provider market. we believe that it is impossible to achieve truly value-based care without a robust independent practice community. our members include aledade, american academy of family physicians (aafp), california medical association (cma), florida medical association, medical group management association (mgma), and texas medical association\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s practiceedge. we also have individual and small medical group supporters across the country, many of whom are independent physicians or practices and wish to remain so.\n\n as you know, physician-led acos have historically outperformed other types of acos. the advantages of independent practice are clear and include their adaptive culture, diversity of practice, ability to function as a laboratory for innovation in value-based care, and last but certainly not least, the fact that they are a lower cost, higher quality site of service for many health conditions.\n\n the evidence shows that physician-led acos have leveraged these advantages into cost savings and quality improvements. a september 2018 study published in the new england journal of medicine took a closer look at the spending differential between traditional medicare fee-for-service (ffs) and mssp among physician-led and hospital-integrated acos. the study found that physician-led acos\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 spending \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3reductions grew with longer participation in the program and were significantly greater than the reductions in hospital-integrated acos.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5* a 2017 report by the department of health and human services (hhs) office of inspector general (oig) showed that high-performing acos

likely\n\n\n 1 mcwilliams, j. michael, et al. \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3medicare spending after 3 years of the medicare shared savings program.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 new

the report showed that 45 percent of high-performing acos were physician-led, compared to just 36 percent for other types of acos.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5\n an important policy goal for pathways to success should thus be to build on and scale the successes of physician-led acos. in the proposed rule, cms creates a distinction between \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3low\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 and \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3high\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 revenue acos. cms defines low revenue acos as small, physician-only, and rural acos whose participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue would be significantly less than total parts a and b expenditures for the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s assigned beneficiaries. cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s presumption is that the low and high revenue distinction will allow cms to move larger entities into arrangements with higher loss sharing limits, while allowing smaller, physician-led organizations to be eligible to transition to two-sided risk-bearing arrangements with more limited downside risk.\n\n we appreciate cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s efforts to distinguish between physician-led acos and acos led by larger entities.\n this is an improvement to the current mssp program, which treats all acos the same despite the clear evidence that low revenue, physician-led acos generate more savings than high revenue acos or next generation acos (see below).\n\n aco savings per beneficiary- 2016 performance year track 1\n low revenue high revenue nextgen m= savings vs benchmark\n\n\n ms additiona savings (spillover)\n\n acopaymenis\n\n\n =

revenue as the standard for this distinction may not achieve cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s desired goal and could be subject to gaming by acos. for example, an aco with a healthier patient population and fewer beneficiaries dually eligible for medicare and medicaid are likely to have lower levels of spending on higher cost services such as hospitalizations or post acute care than other acos. in that scenario, the aco participants\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 revenue will represent a higher share of total spending and the aco may appear to be \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3high revenue.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 cms should ensure that its methodology rewards acos who do a better job of controlling spending instead of emphasizing revenue. cms should also carefully monitor the types of acos qualifying for additional incentives offered only to specific types of acos, making adjustments as needed to ensure that benefits intended for physician-led acos are truly being received by the types of acos that cms intended to receive them.\n\n while our comments below focus on pathways to success, we do want to note that the results generated by physician-led acos bolster our belief that physicians can and should have the opportunity to lead value- based care models beyond existing models. as noted in our principles for value-based care (appendix a),\n\n\n ? levinson, daniel r. medicare program shared savings accountable care organizations have shown potential for reducing spending and improving quality. u.s. department of health and human services, aug. 2017, oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-15-00450.pdf.\n\n pepg\n partnership to empower physician-led care\n cms should consider the unique circumstances of physicians in independent practice when developing models, ensuring that there are options available for this cohort of the workforce and recognizing that models that are appropriate for large hospital-led groups and/or large physician practices may not be appropriate for all.\n\n with this background in mind, we offer the following recommendations for the evolution of the existing aco programs into pathways for success:\n\n\n1. werecommend that cms finalize proposals to adopt revenue-based risk under the basic track\n while continuing to offer physician-led acos the opportunity to spend adequate time in a one- sided, shared savings-only model.\n\n we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to adopt revenue-based risk in the basic track, aligning this participation option with the very popular track 1+ innovation center demonstration. with the exception of track 1+, to date, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s other two-sided aco models (track 2, track 3 and next generation aco) required physicians to take on levels of risk that were so high as to be a significant deterrent to program participation for independent physicians. the level of risk was not proportional to the finances of the entity leading the aco, and as a result, larger, hospital-led acos were proportionally allowed to take much smaller amounts of risk while smaller, physician-led acos were required to accept a level of risk that presented an existential threat to their practice.\n\n to increase participation in cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 aco initiatives and other value-based care programs, we previously recommended to cms that new models should allow physician practices to assume appropriate financial risk for reducing costs proportional to their finances while offering greater reward over time for practices agreeing to take on more risk. the proposed change aligns with our recommendation, and we believe it is the single most important thing cms can do to encourage independent physicians to participate in and take risk under pathways to success. we strongly urge cms to finalize this proposal.\n\n we further urge cms to continue to allow physician-led acos to spend adequate time in a one-sided, shared savings-only model. cms should balance its desire to push acos to take on risk faster with a recognition that it takes time for practices to adopt a value-based culture, make workflow adjustments and infrastructure improvements, and establish effective governance processes. we do not believe that two years in a one-sided model is adequate time to make all of the changes needed to convert from a fee- for-service to value-based culture and be ready to take downside risk.\n\n\n2. we recommend that cms incentivize physician-led acos to participate in pathways to success\n by increasing the minimum shared savings rate and reducing the minimum savings rate for these acos.\n\n given the data cited above regarding the superior results achieved by physician-led acos, we recommend that cms use all available policy levers to incentivize participation of these acos in pathways to success.\n this includes increasing the proposed shared savings rate beyond the proposed 25% for physician-led acos in the basic track, and offering a lower minimum savings rate.\n\n in the rule, cms proposes to dramatically drop the shared savings rate for acos entering the program in a one-sided model from 50% to 25% for the first year, gradually increasing the shared savings rate over\n pepg\n partnership to empower physician-led care\n the course of the five year performance period. the result is that acos that start at level a and work their way through the glidepath in the basic track will not realize the 50% shared savings rate until their fifth year in the program \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 a rate that is currently available to one-sided acos in their first year of the program.\n\n while we understand that cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 goal is to move acos to higher levels of risk and reward faster, we have strong concerns that dropping the minimum shared savings rate for acos in the basic track will significantly deter new acos, and especially physician-led acos, from entering the program. clinicians and practices seeking to start or join an aco must make significant practice changes and investments to position themselves for success in the program. for independent physicians, the potential reward for making these changes must be high enough to justify initial infrastructure costs, as well as ongoing investments in staff and other resources needed for population health management. these costs can add up to a substantial portion of their practice revenue. as a result, we recommend that cms maintain the current 50% minimum shared savings rate for one-sided physician-led acos in the basic track. this rate should increase over the course of the performance period.\n\n in addition to a higher shared savings rate, we encourage cms to offer a lower minimum savings rate to physician-led acos. it takes time \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 often a number of years \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 for acos to generate savings and reduce costs such that they are guaranteed to cross the minimum savings rate. this is a special challenge for physician-led acos because they need to achieve returns on investment to create the reserves needed to go to risk; they do not have the financial resources available to acos led by larger institutions. given this reality, we believe that cms could further incentivize participation in acos by physicians by lowering the minimum savings rate for physician-led acos in basic levels a and b by 2% from the current rate. this would support earlier transitions to risk while ensuring that cms is protected against instances where acos do not make investments and still receive savings payments.\n\n\n3. we support proposals to provide more predictable and accurate risk adjustment and\n benchmarks that work for physician-led payment models.\n\n under the current aco regulations, cms incorporates a regional adjustment into the benchmark during the second performance period. the proposed rule recognizes the value of this adjustment in setting accurate benchmarks for many acos, and proposes to incorporate the adjustment in the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first performance period. we believe strongly that efficient practices \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 such as many independent practices \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 should be rewarded for their efforts and incentivized to continue to improve quality and reduce costs. we support changes that create predictability and simplicity that will encourage efficient providers to participate and succeed under the program.\n\n we note, however, that cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposed 5% cap on regional adjustment is low and recommend that cms modestly adjust its cap upward to 8%. an increase in the cap would be consistent with cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s desire to promote physician-led acos, as it would improve the economics of participating in the program for the very type of acos that are most likely to generate savings and improve quality.\n\n 4. we recommend that cms remove an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries from the regional comparator.\n while we were pleased that cms proposed incorporating a regional adjuster into the benchmarking\n methodology earlier in the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s lifespan, we strongly recommend that cms remove an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries from the regional benchmark and trend. including an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s own beneficiaries in the regional\n pepg\n partnership to empower physician-led care\n benchmark and trend has the practical effect of pitting the aco against itself, making it that much harder for the aco to realize savings and be comfortable taking on increasing amounts risk. the effect is disproportionately felt by rural acos, given that there are fewer patients included in the comparator. it is also acutely felt by independent physicians leading successful acos, as this policy effectively functions as a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3penalty\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 for their success. it is counterproductive to cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 goal of encouraging these providers to participate and assume greater amounts of risk as it essentially creates a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3headwind\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 that they must overcome to realize savings.\n\n\n5. we support cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 proposal to recognize positive and negative changes in patient health status,\n but recommend that cms allow for a slightly higher adjustment to capture outlier cases and create predictability.\n\n as you have undoubtedly heard many times, cms can encourage physician participation in pathways to success by creating predictability in the benchmark. recent data from the american academy of family physicians practice profile survey showed that one of the biggest barriers to value-based care adoption among family physicians continues to be the unpredictability of the revenue stream.\n\n one way to create predictability is to structure the benchmarking methodology to allow for modest changes in patient health status. we believe that predictability is of the utmost importance for physician- led acos, and were pleased that cms proposed up to a 3% positive or negative adjustment to account for changes in a patients\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 health status over the course of the performance period. this proposal strikes a balance between allowing for some variation while providing predictability and guarding against gaming.\n\n to further improve upon its proposal, cms could consider increasing the adjustment to up to 5% over the performance period. we believe that this change makes sense given that cms is proposing to extend the length of the performance period to five years, and that the advancing age of beneficiaries in the medicare population increases the chances that at least a portion of an aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s attributed population will experience a significant change in health status over the course of the performance period. increasing the adjustment would capture additional outlier cases and reduce any incentives acos may have had to \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3lemon drop\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 sick patients or \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3cherry pick\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 healthy patients.\n\n\n6. we strongly encourage cms not to mandate beneficiary opt-in as a primary or sole mechanism\n for attributing patients to an aco.\n\n while cms did not propose to require beneficiary opt-in attribution in pathways to success, the proposed rule extensively described the methodology cms would use if it were to require or allow it in future years.\n cms also noted that it is seeking feedback on its methodology, and that it is considering scenarios under which beneficiary opt-in is a primary or sole mechanism for attributing patients to acos in future years.\n\n we strongly oppose a beneficiary opt-in mandate, and caution that such a requirement would effectively end physician participation in pathways to success. physician practices, especially those that are unaffiliated with a health system or health plan, do not have the resources needed to develop and implement the complex, continuous enrollment and reporting processes described in the proposed rule.\n such a requirement would significantly increase the costs of administering and running an aco, skewing the cost-benefit analysis many physician practices consider before joining the program. while the current\n pepg\n partnership to empower physician-led care\n process is not perfect, we urge cms to maintain claims-based attribution and voluntary alignment as the primary mechanism for assigned patients to an aco.\n\n * kkk *k\n please do not hesitate to reach out to me if the partnership to empower physician-led care can be a resource to you. | can be reached at

care\n physicians are best positioned to drive delivery system transformation. physicians \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 especially independent physician practices \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 are the lynch pin of our nation\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s health care system. they have repeatedly demonstrated their superior ability to generate positive results in value-based care arrangements, both in improved health outcomes and reduced costs. they are the most powerful tool we have to foster an affordable, accessible system that puts patients first.\n\n models should be accessible to a wide range of physicians, including physicians choosing to remain independent. as you know, the physician workforce is not homogenous. instead, there are physicians in large practices and small practices, in rural and urban settings, in a variety of different employment arrangements. cms should consider the unique circumstances of physicians in independent practice when developing models, ensuring that there are options available for this cohort of the workforce and recognizing that models that are appropriate for large hospital-led groups and/or large physician practices may not be appropriate for all.\n\n new models should allow physician practices to assume appropriate financial risk for reducing costs proportional to their finances while offering greater reward over time for practices agreeing to take on more risk. to attract independent practices, risk must be proportional to their finances and not so large as to favor consolidation of practices. an example of a recent model that is calibrated to reflect the financial realities faced by small physician practices is track 1+, which incorporates risk that is meaningful but not so large as to be an existential threat to a physician\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s business. cmmi should also provide more predictable and accurate risk adjustment and benchmarks that work for a range of physician practices.\n\n models should test a range of innovations aimed at encouraging consumers to engage in their care while not imposing substantial new administrative burdens or paperwork requirements on physician practices. in implementing new models, cms could consider a range of beneficiary- focused design elements including allowing medicare beneficiaries to voluntarily enroll in the model(s) with the primary care physician of their choice; or rewarding beneficiaries for decision- making that results in cost reductions by, for example, sharing in any savings obtained by the practice if the practice is participating in a shared savings model, receiving added benefits from their physicians and/or having their cost-sharing reduced or eliminated. as cms considers requiring practices to voluntarily enroll and/or recruit patients to participate in care models, we caution that this would be a significant barrier to participation for many independent practices.\n we urge cms to consider maintaining and improving processes for attributing patients based on historical claims for practices and clinicians that do not have the resources or desire to implement robust patient outreach and enrollment strategies.\n\n quality measures should be harmonized across new and existing models to the extent possible and cms should use a parsimonious list of meaningful measures that reduce the burden of reporting. quality measurement and improvement is of the utmost importance for value-based care, and should be incorporated into all alternative payment models, including physician-led models. we urge cms to harmonize measures across new and existing models, focusing on those measures that have the greatest impact on patient care.\n\n\n", "0393": "see attached file(s) 1111 14th street, nw, suite 900, washington, dc 20005    |    (202) 638-7151    |   nchc.org\n october 16, 2018 seema verma administrator centers for

administrator verma:\n the national coalition on health care appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations--pathways to success (cms-1701-p). the national coalition on health care (nchc) is the largest, most broadly representa- tive nonpartisan alliance of organizations focused on health care. the coalition is committed to advanc- ing\u00e2\u0080\u0094through research and analysis, public education, outreach, and informed advocacy\u00e2\u0080\u0094an affordable, high-value health care system for all stakeholders. our members and supporters include more than 80 of america\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading associations of health care providers, employers and unions, consumer and patient advocacy organizations, pension and health funds, religious denominations, and health plans.\n 2 national coalition on health care aggregate benchmarks since the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inception. the 2017 mssp results, like previous annual re1- sults, indicate that acos with longer experience in mssp are more likely to generate shared savings. performance year 2017 saw the highest share of acos (34%) generate shared savings, and the lowest percentage of acos with shared losses. over 50% of the acos that have been in mssp since 2012 earned shared savings in 2017, according to cms. 2 in addition to generating year-over-year savings relative to cms-determined benchmarks, evidence sug- gests mssp acos are also slowing the rate of per capita cost growth when compared to beneficiaries enrolled in traditional medicare who are not served by a mssp aco. it is likely that mssp is causing 3 positive spillover effects on the cost trajectory of unattributed beneficiaries in traditional medicare who also receive care from aco-affiliated clinicians. table 16 in the proposed rule highlights the correlation between markets with experienced acos, and markets experiencing the lowest cumulative per capita cost trends (which have been lower than the national average) since 2012. moreover, since benchmarks for medicare advantage premiums and annual updates are based on per capita costs and trends in fee- for-service medicare, mssp may be moderating cost growth in medicare advantage as well. high-level comments on pathway to success in light of the accumulating evidence that mssp is spurring quality improvement and moderating medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s per capita cost trajectory, we request that cms modify certain proposed model design changes to retain participation by acos who are demonstrating progress, and to attract new entrants to the program. we agree that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cend state\u00e2\u0080\u009d for acos should be two-sided risk payment models. howev- er, we recommend a steeper slope for shared savings as acos move through basic model and to en- hanced model, with flatter, asymmetric shared loss slopes, and a broader set of model end states to support a range of acos serving diverse and competitive markets, while also producing better value for medicare and beneficiaries. the national coalition recommends the eventual convergence of medicare acos with medicare ad- vantage on key model design features and parameters, such as the setting of benchmarks, capitation, an- nual updates, risk adjustment, quality metrics, and quality incentives. we recognize that this conver- gence would take time, and the feature of beneficiary choice in the aco model may limit full conver- gence. convergence of major program elements would minimize administrative complexity for medicare, providers and plans. it would also reduce beneficiary confusion, and allow more accurate comparison of performance of the two models.

participation in mssp. we believe these changes are directionally correct, but defer to experts and modelers on the specific parameters, or whether alternative approaches could produce similar incen- tives while providing similar or better fiscal protection for medicare. in table 2 we identify proposed changes that we are concerned would deter continued growth in mssp.\n 4 national coalition on health care table 2\n1. positive steps forward \n 5 national coalition on health care ipate in good faith and become more efficient. for calculating annual trend factors, we recommend that cms explore statistical approaches to remove the cost experience of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed beneficiaries from its regional trend factor calculation.\n\n2. concerns with other proposed changes \n 7 national coalition on health care we believe it is premature and too limiting to declare the enhanced model as proposed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinal\u00e2\u0080\u009d mssp model. as the aco program matures, the end state could look different in different markets and among acos. for example, we would expect to see more acos partner with medicare advantage plans in shared risk arrangements as they become more proficient at managing risk. such acos might seek to have greater alignment between models they enter with ma or other commercial plans, and mssp. shared risk arrangements in the commercial market vary to meet the needs of both parties, and mssp models should be similarly flexible. at the same time, we may see medicare advantage risk contracting begin to adopt standard features of the mssp models, especially if a range of shared risk models are of- fered. interaction with macra advanced payment model bonus differs by aco type while the possibility of receiving a 5% bonus for participating in an alternative payment model (apm) is an added incentive for physicians and other clinicians to join a two-sided aco payment model, it is a weaker incentive for hospital-based acos. even for physician-based acos, it is extremely difficult for a clinician to know in advance if his or her revenue earned in the apm will meet or exceed the required threshold to qualify for macra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apm bonus. we also recommend that the nominal risk definition in macra for qualifying apm status (3% ) be aligned with the e model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lost sharing limit. monitor for gaming, excessive losses we support close cms monitoring of acos with shared losses or expenditures outside their corridor for two consecutive years, and termination if other behavior or organizational issues support termination. we also recognize the opportunity for acos to reorganize or otherwise terminate and re-enter to secure participation in mssp under better terms as program rules or market conditions change. we support close cms monitoring of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaming\u00e2\u0080\u009d behavior and taking action when specific gaming behavior is identi- fied. the proposed designations for experienced, inexperienced, and re-entering acos appear reason- able.\n\n", "0394": "please read attached letter, attachment 1: cms-1701-p medicare program comments

(whn) is currently comprised of over 1,400 physicians and eleven hospitals in georgia, serving close to 50,000 medicare beneficiaries through the mssp aco program, and is one of the largest and most experienced medicare accountable care organizations (ac0s) in georgia. since its formation in 2012, the whn has been committed to achieving the goals of the \"healthcare triple aim\". as a result, our aco has earned shared savings four of the five years we have been in the program amassing cumulative savings to medicare of over $57 million. we have also consistently had quality scores in the high 80s, improving to a 92 percent quality score for 2017, as well as high patient satisfaction scores, including an 88 percent patient satisfaction score for care coordination in 2017. notably, based on our 2017 results, whn is among the top 20 performing mssp acos in the nation. in addition, whn is an original member of the premier inc. population health management collaborative (phmc) whose participants have demonstrated the power of the aco model. since 2012, medicare acos that participate in the phmc have outperformed their peers in achieving cost and quality improvements. nearly half of phmc medicare aco participants received shared savings payments in performance year 2016 compared to 33 percent of all medicare acos. in addition, since 2012 phmc medicare acos have performed 57 percent better on average in achieving shared savings. as a member of the phmc, we generally support and agree with many of the detailed comments in the letter from premier's public affairs office regarding cms-1701-p medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success. however, there are a couple of areas that we would like to stress and or offer our personal perspectives for cms consideration. whn supports the appropriate and measured implementation of value-based payments and as such would like to continue with the mssp aco program. specifically, we have invested over $12 million dollars into support of the mssp aco program to drive the results described above. however, the proposed rules, which require a near term acceptance of downside risk, will cause whn to discontinue its participation in this program. the reason for our conclusion to discontinue our participation in this experiment, should the proposed rules go into effect is, despite our extraordinary success under track 1 since 2012, whn has appealed what we believe to be flaws in the data accumulation and risk adjustment system used by cms, three years in

(acos)\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success\n\n dear administrator verma: the advanced medical technology association (advamed) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the medicare shared savings program proposed rule released august 9, 2018.  advamed member companies produce the medical devices and technologies that play an important role in allowing medicare beneficiaries to lead healthy, productive, and independent lives, and in the process, serve the twin purposes and objectives of the medicare shared savings program (mssp)--to reduce the rate of growth in medicare spending and to improve the quality of care medicare beneficiaries receive.\n ensuring patient access to appropriate care\n since their inception in the affordable care act, advamed has supported the medicare shared saving program and other delivery reform models implemented by cms and the center for medicare & medicaid innovation.  we have done so because we believe that our companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 technologies can and do play a central role in improving quality and creating efficiencies in care delivery.\n seema verma, administrator october 16, 2018 page 2 of 5\n bringing innovation to patient care worldwide | 2 including new and less invasive technologies for treating heart disease, innovative joint implants that lead to shorter recovery periods and extend durability of the implant for many years, new molecular diagnostic tests that identify more effective treatment therapies for disease, and robotic-assisted surgical technologies that result in better outcomes for patients.  the potential negative impact of the financial incentives of these models is magnified by the short payment windows used in the programs to compare actual spending against benchmarks in order to determine the level of savings that may be shared among providers. many medical devices and technologies provide benefits over a long period of time spanning multiple years.\n we have argued in past letters and continue to believe that adjustments for certain new technologies are necessary to ensure medicare beneficiaries access to the full range of treatment options and new technologies considered by their providers as appropriate for their medical conditions\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the extent these are more expensive than a current standard of care.  in the past, we have pointed to data analysis by one of our member companies that looked at utilization rates for several interventional treatment options for arterial procedures and utilization rates of these options for medicare beneficiaries served by acos. the analysis showed an increase in utilization of a lower cost procedure option and a decrease in utilization of a higher cost alternative procedure for patients served by acos. the increase in utilization of the lower cost option could mean more frequent re- interventions for patients in the future, with the result that higher savings for acos in the short-term could also mean higher long-term spending for the medicare program in the subsequent years.\n we have also written about some of our orthopedic companies finding that certain providers participating in bundled payment programs dramatically changing the types of hip and knee implants they order\u00e2\u0080\u0094ordering almost exclusively less expensive, lower utility hip and knee implants that may not corresponded to the lifestyle needs of patients, based on their life expectancy, level of activity, and medical conditions. the longer-term impact of using almost exclusively lower utility devices, when they are not appropriate for the lifestyle and medical needs of individual patients, may not be known for several years, when active beneficiaries may require earlier than expected revision procedures or experience other negative outcomes--at greater expense to the medicare program. if the choice of a hip or knee device were made solely on the basis of patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 relative health, lifestyle and life expectancy, patients would be provided a device that is appropriately demand matched to their unique needs to ensure the best possible outcomes and longevity, without cost entering the equation of the decision about which implant to use. these changes our orthopedic companies have witnessed seem to suggest a purely economic response to the financial incentives of the payment reform models, rather than a considered assessment based on medical criteria.\n seema verma, administrator october 16, 2018 page 3 of 5\n bringing innovation to patient care worldwide | 3 advamed also notes that cms has acknowledged the impact a higher cost innovative technology can have on providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability or interest in using that technology in patient care when they participate in delivery reform models, specifically bpci and the comprehensive care for joint replacement (cjr) bundled payment model. the innovation center has approved carve outs of ipps new technology add-on payments (ntaps) from both the actual historical episode expenditure data used to set target prices and from the hospital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actual episode spending that is reconciled to the target price for providers participating in these programs. in proposing the carve out of ntap amounts for the cjr model, cms noted that it would not be appropriate for the model to potentially hamper beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 access to new technologies that receive ntaps or to burden hospitals who choose to use these new technologies with concern about these payments counting toward actual expenditures. advamed recommends that this policy be extended to acos, both the mssp program and innovation center acos, and that cms apply a similar process to other technologies as recommended above and in our previous letters.\n in addition, we have recommended that cms and cmmi evaluate excessive device standardization for beneficiaries served in these models, and also compare care on several other dimensions (referrals to specialists, utilization guideline recommended care, outcomes for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions) for those served under these alternative payment models with those not receiving care from providers participating in the models.\n for these reasons, we are concerned that the proposed rule, with its new and shorter transition to shared losses, could lead to even greater pressure on providers to respond to the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial incentives to reduce spending on services.  these pressures in turn may lead to greater risk that patient access to innovative treatments and technologies will be compromised, especially when these are more expensive than the standard of care embedded in benchmarks.  advamed recommends that cms extend the length of the agreement period for acos to seven years with a more gradual phase-in of shared losses.\n quality measures used in mssp\n seema verma,

value-based measure sets where measures are available but are not being used. specifically, the study assesses quality measure gaps across eight diverse clinical areas and example medical technologies

quality measures and seeks to establish new quality measure sets for these programs.  the study may be found at: https://www.advamed.org/resource-center/medical-technology-value-based-environment-

to thank you for the opportunity to provide comments to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) on the medicare shared savings program (mssp) \u00e2\u0080\u009cpathways to success\u00e2\u0080\u009d proposed rule.  the cma supports many of the proposed policies aimed at improving the program for physician-led accountable care organizations (acos).  however, we are extremely concerned with the general direction of the program to eliminate the medicare shared savings payment (mssp) track 1 acos and force inappropriate downside financial risk on any and all physician-led organizations which will discourage independent physicians from participating.  we urge cms to rework some of the proposals to ensure that high quality, cost-efficient physicians can continue to participate in the aco program now and in the future.\nphysician-led acos have been the great aco success story by reducing costs and improving quality more than the other type of acos.  accountable care organizations (acos) were created to empower local physicians to work together to coordinate care, improve quality, enhance the patient experience and reduce inefficiencies in our current fragmented system of care.  according to recent studies, physician-led acos have outperformed other types of acos.   a new study in the new england journal of medicine analyzed the spending differential between traditional medicare fee-for-service (ffs) and mssp among physician-led and hospital integrated acos.  the study found that physician-led acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 spending \u00e2\u0080\u009creductions grew with longer participation in the program and were significantly greater than the reductions in hospital-integrated acos.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the study reported that mssp saved more than $200 million in 2013-2014 and $145 million in 2016 after accounting for shared savings bonuses earned by acos. \u0002 mcwilliams, j. michael, et al. \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedicare

other acos.\noverall, cma is concerned that several provisions in the proposed rule would undermine physicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to participate in and lead acos.   we urge cms to retain the one-sided medicare shared savings acos and to ensure the financial risk requirements on other types of acos are more appropriate for physician practices.  and finally, if cms imposes downside financial risk on acos, the cms risk adjustment methodology must better account for important factors, such as patient socioeconomic characteristics, updated chronic conditions, stage of illness and be limited to costs physicians can control.\nsummary of cma recommendations\ncma supports the comments submitted by the ama.  the cma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more detailed comments are in the attached addendum.  below are cma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s california-specific recommendations:\nsupport extending the aco agreement periods from three to five years which promotes stability and predictability.\nsupport the proposal to account for positive and negative changes in patient health status over time but recommend that cms allow for a higher adjustment (up to 5% positive or negative) to capture outlier cases and create predictability.\nmedicare shared savings program\nstrongly oppose elimination of the aco track 1 medicare shared savings program (mssp).  urge its retention for physician-led organizations.\noppose cutting the shared savings rates from 50% to 25%.  we urge cms to reinstate the 50% shared savings payments.\nrecommend that cms reduce the minimum savings rate by 2% from the current rate because it takes time to generate savings and physician-led acos do not have the reserves of larger institutions.\nrecommend modifications to the current track 1 mssp acos to increase net savings, such as terminating acos that have not achieved savings over several years, reducing shared savings payments, or allowing acos to only be accountable for spending they control versus the total cost of care.\nsupport integrating the track 1+ model into the medicare shared savings program.\naccountable care organizations\noppose moving all acos to downside financial risk arrangements because the studies show that upside-only risk acos reduced spending more than any other type of aco.\nwhile cma supports setting risk requirements on a percentage of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenues  instead of its benchmark spending, we recommend that cms adopt the ama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alternative approach to the cms \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d/\u00e2\u0080\u009dhigh revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d risk proposal that is  based on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to control spending.\nstrongly recommend that cms reform its risk adjustment methodology to account for important factors that are more appropriate for physician risk, such as patient socioeconomic characteristics, an updated hierarchical condition category for new chronic conditions, stage of illness, and costs beyond a physician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control.  requiring acos to accept downside risk on a flawed methodology will penalize physician-led acos and create barriers to care.\nurge cms to adopt the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartial capitation\u00e2\u0080\u009d model authorized by statute.\naco benchmarks and attribution\ncma supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 move to a larger regional benchmark in year 1 rather than mandating that efficient physician organizations be compared to themselves through historical spending data.  such benchmarking methods deter physician participation in the aco program, particularly in california\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high-efficiency regions.  california\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new physician-led acos believe it is acceptable to be compared on a regional level initially but over time, a national benchmark is more equitable for all physicians.  local and even regional benchmarks discriminate against already efficient physicians in the following ways:\ncalifornia physicians are extremely efficient because of the long history of managed care in california.  ten of the top twenty lowest-spending hrr medicare regions are in california.  because already efficient california physicians are compared to themselves in the aco program, it is more difficult to achieve savings and therefore, they have been discouraged from participating.\nthere are two acos in california that were started by cma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affiliated county medical societies.  they accepted the challenge and opportunity to develop a physician-led aco so that physicians could work together at the local level to better manage the care of patients in their community.  these acos are county-wide.  a regional benchmark compares these acos to themselves and over time penalizes their efficiencies.    we recommend a regional benchmark but only in the initial years.\nfinally, there are very large medical groups in california that operate across an entire region.  these groups face the same disincentives.\ntherefore, at a minimum, we urge cms to allow physician-led acos to be regionally compared to themselves initially but transition to a national benchmark for acos with a service area that spans across most of a region.  we would also urge cms to increase the cap on the regional or national adjustment from 5% to at least 8%.  these two recommendations would improve the economics for already efficient regional physician organizations to participate in the program.\nrecommend that cms also remove an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own beneficiaries from the regional comparator.  this is particularly important for acos in rural areas with fewer patients.  current policy penalizes efficient acos and makes it much more difficult to realize savings  - particularly in a risk environment. removing an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own beneficiaries from the benchmarks would allow efficient groups and rural groups to participate.\nrequest that cms not mandate beneficiary opt-in as a mechanism for attributing patients to an aco.    this would substantially increase aco administrative costs and therefore, discourage physician-led acos.\ntimely data and reporting\ntimely data must be provided from cms in a format that can be used by an aco to accurately assess their financial status and the savings being generated.  monthly reconciliation adjustments should be applied to claims. cms should build a portal to present accurate, up-to-date, timely information to acos rather than forcing acos to use third party vendors to interpret cms data.\nmultiple alternative payment models\ncms should provide multiple kinds of payment models for physician-led organizations that allow shared-savings, more appropriate levels of financial risk and other payment methods.  this is the most important change that cms could make to encourage efficient, independent physician practices and other physician groups to participate in alternative models.\nfinally, it is important to note that in a recent survey by the national association of acos, more than 70 percent of acos reported that they were likely to leave the aco program as a result of being forced to assume downside financial risk in this proposed rule.  many physician-led acos in california would be forced out.  we believe that the aco program has presented physicians with an important opportunity to better manage and coordinate the care of their patients.  it is a learning curve and a pathway to more sophisticated forms of payment, such as financial risk.  but it is too soon to eliminate this option for independent practices who want to make the transitions to new payment and delivery models.\nthank you for allowing us to comment.  our detailed comments are attached.  we look forward to working with you to ensure the continued success of physician-led acos.    the cma contact is

(acos)\nplease see the cma cover letter for a discussion of the successful physician-led acos that have generated more savings and provided higher quality care than all other types of acos.\nprovisions supported by the cma\nsupport extending the aco agreement periods from three to five years which promotes stability and predictability.\nsupport the proposal to account for positive and negative changes in patient health status over time but recommend that cms allow for a higher adjustment (up to 5% positive or negative) to capture outlier cases and create predictability.\nwe urge cms to consider at least annual adjustments to aco benchmarks and aco baseline scores in patient health status to reflect the real changes seniors experience, such as a cancer diagnosis or a fall, or even an undocumented pre-existing condition, all of which can dramatically impact the costs of care.   for an aging senior, there could be a substantial change in their health status over a five year period.  we also believe that cms should change the 3% risk score adjustment factor to at least 5% positive/negative to account for outliers.  increasing the adjustment would also prevent acos from dropping sick patients and cherry-picking healthy patients.\nmedicare shared savings program\ncma strongly opposes elimination of the aco track 1 medicare shared savings program (mssp).  urge its retention for physician-led organizations.\nunder the proposed rule, all acos would be required to move into a two-sided (upside/downside) financial risk model.  this proposal should not be finalized.  we strongly urge cms to continue to allow physician-led acos to spend more time in a one-sided, shared savings-only model.\nthe track 1 model should be retained for the following reasons:\nphysician-led acos have demonstrated that they are higher quality and lower cost than all other types of acos.\nmany acos have demonstrated that they can reduce medicare spending without accepting downside risk.  in 2017 track 1 acos achieved greater savings than acos with downside risk in tracks 2 and 3.  according to the center for healthcare quality and payment reform, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedicare actually spends more per beneficiary in the downside risk acos than in other acos, with no difference in quality.  moreover, acos that have moved to downside risk tracks have saved less after doing so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u0002 miller, harold d.  \u00e2\u0080\u009chow to fix the medicare shared savings program,\u00e2\u0080\u009d center for healthcare quality and payment

several community-based, physician-led mssp acos in california that made significant investments in practice management and population health management systems, infrastructure, governance, staffing and reporting mechanisms in order to participate in the mssp.  they spent the first year in implementation and the learning curve was steep.  finally, in the second year, they have become better established and experienced with operating an aco.  they are now projected to generate a savings for 2018.  the proposed rule will force them out of the program because they cannot accept such high levels of financial risk by 2019.  two years in this program does not provide physician-led acos adequate time to convert to a value-based culture and demonstrate savings.  we believe it is important to retain these groups of independent physicians on their path to value-based care for both the physicians, their patients and the medicare program.  they need more experience before they can move to a risk-based model.  we urge cms to retain this payment track as an option for physician-led organizations.\nmoreover, as documented by the centers for health care quality and payment reform, acos can achieve savings for medicare without downside financial risk.  track 1 acos saved an average of $37 per beneficiary, 36% more per beneficiary than the track 2 and track 3 acos.  terminating the track 1 program would actually increase medicare spending.\noppose cutting the shared savings rates from 50% to 25%.  we urge cms to reinstate the track 1 mssp acos and the 50% shared savings payments.\nin the proposed rule, cms proposes to reduce the shared savings rate for acos from 50% to 25% for the first year, gradually increasing the shared savings rate over the five year performance period.  therefore, acos in the new basic track would not be able to obtain a 50% savings rate until the fifth year of the program.  we believe this will deter new physician-led acos from entering the program because the upfront investments required to start an aco were substantial and the delay in receiving a full shared savings, will make it extremely difficult for them to continue. maintaining the current 50% shared savings rate will continue to incentivize the extremely efficient, high quality track 1 physician-led acos to participate.\nrecommend that cms reduce the minimum savings rate by 2% from the current rate because it takes time for new physician-led acos  to generate savings and physician-led acos do not have the  reserves of larger institutions. lowering the rate would incentivize physician-led acos to continue to participate.\nrecommend modifications to the current track 1 mssp acos to increase net savings, such as terminating acos that have not achieved savings over several years, reducing shared savings payments, or allowing physician-led acos to only be accountable for spending they control versus the total cost of care as recommended by the center for healthcare quality and payment reform.\u0002 miller, harold d. ibid\n\u0002 miller, harold d. ibid\nrequiring acos to accept downside financial risk is not the only way to increase net savings from the mssp acos.  therefore, we urge cms to consider such modifications, rather than retiring track 1 mssp acos.\nsupport integrating the track 1+ model into the mssp.\naccountable care organizations\noppose moving all acos to downside financial risk arrangements because the studies show that upside-only risk acos reduced spending more than any other type of aco. acos can achieve savings without downside risk.\nplease see the previous section and the data presented in the cover letter related to the success of physician-led acos and track 1 acos.\ncma strongly urges cms to adopt multiple payment models for physician-led organizations that include shared savings, appropriate levels of downside financial risk and other payment methods.  we believe that cms should provide numerous options for physicians to participate in alternative payment models depending on their mode of practice, their specialty and location.\nwhile cma supports setting risk requirements on a percentage of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenues  instead of its benchmark spending, we recommend that cms adopt the ama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alternative approach to the cms \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d/\u00e2\u0080\u009dhigh revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d risk proposal that is  based on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to control spending.\ncma supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to adopt revenue-based risk instead of benchmark spending.   we strongly recommend that it be no more than 8% of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medicare part b revenue.\ncms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 two-sided financial risk aco models (track 2, track 3 and next generation) require physicians to accept inappropriate levels of financial risk that have constituted barriers to participation.  therefore, we urge cms to maintain the mssp track 1 aco program without requiring downside financial risk and to reduce the financial risk amounts for other physician-led acos who do not have the capital, the resources or the revenue to responsibly manage high-levels of risk.  we also ask that cms authorize multiple aco pathways with different levels of shared savings and financial risk that are appropriate for physician-led acos.\ncma also recommends that cms adopt the alternative proposal forwarded by the ama that would replace the proposed \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d/\u00e2\u0080\u009dhigh revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d aco distinction with a methodology that measures the degree of control that acos have over total medicare parts a and b fee-for-service (ffs) expenditures for their assigned patients.  the current proposal is too focused on identifying acos with financial resources rather than the savings that can be achieved by an aco.  moreover, the ama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal would also ensure that acos are not held accountable for costs they cannot control \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as decisions made by non-aco physicians chosen by their patients.\nstrongly recommend that cms reform its risk adjustment methodology.\nthe cms medicare risk adjustment methodology needs to be improved to account for important factors that are more appropriate for physician risk, such as patient socioeconomic characteristics, social determinants of health, an updated hierarchical condition category (hcc) for new chronic conditions, stage of illness, functional status, and costs beyond a physician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control.  requiring acos to accept downside risk based on a flawed methodology could financially penalize physicians for delivering services their patients need and create barriers to care for the sickest patients.\nurge cms to consider the concurrent risk methodology.\nthe concurrent risk methodology is used to develop payments made to plans participating in state and federal affordable care act exchanges as an alternative to the current and flawed medicare risk-adjustment methodology.  the association of america\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health insurance plans advocated for such a methodology because it better accounts for sicker patients.\nurge cms to adopt the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartial capitation\u00e2\u0080\u009d model authorized by the affordable care act as another option for physician-led organizations.  it has yet to be implemented.\naco benchmarks and attribution\noppose a regional adjustment in the benchmarking methodology and recommend that it be a based on the national average of expenditures.  also urge cms to increase its proposed cap to incent cost-efficient, quality care.\ncma supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 move to a larger regional benchmark in year 1 rather than mandating that efficient physician organizations be compared to themselves through historical spending data.  such benchmarking methods deter physician participation in the aco program, particularly in california\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high-efficiency regions.  california\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new physician-led acos believe it is acceptable to be compared on a regional level initially but over time, a national benchmark is more equitable for all physicians.  local and even regional benchmarks discriminate against already efficient physicians in the following ways:\ncalifornia physicians are extremely efficient because of the long history of managed care in california.  ten of the top twenty lowest-spending hrr medicare regions are in california.  because already efficient california physicians are compared to themselves in the aco program, it is more difficult to achieve savings and therefore, they have been discouraged from participating.\nthere are two acos in california that were started by cma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affiliated county medical societies.  they accepted the challenge and opportunity to develop a physician-led aco so that physicians could work together at the local level to better manage the care of patients in their community.  these acos are county-wide.  a regional benchmark compares these acos to themselves and over time penalizes their efficiencies.    we recommend a regional benchmark but only in the initial years.\nfinally, there are very large medical groups in california that operate across an entire region.  these groups face the same disincentives.\ntherefore, at a minimum, we urge cms to allow physician-led acos to be regionally compared to themselves initially but transition to a national benchmark for acos with a service area that spans across most of a region.  we would also urge cms to increase the cap on the regional or national adjustment from 5% to at least 8%.  these two recommendations would improve the economics for already efficient regional physician organizations to participate in the program.\nrecommend that cms also remove an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own beneficiaries from the regional comparator.\nthis recommendation is particularly important for acos in rural areas with fewer patients.  current policy penalizes efficient acos and makes it much more difficult to realize savings  - particularly in a risk environment. removing an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own beneficiaries from the benchmarks would allow efficient groups and rural groups to participate.\nrequest that cms not mandate beneficiary opt-in as a mechanism for attributing patients to an aco.\ncma believes that patients must have a choice of physicians and acos.  this would also  substantially increase aco administrative costs and therefore, discourage physician-led acos.\ntimely data and reporting\ntimely data must be provided from cms in a format that can be used by an aco to accurately assess their financial status and the savings being generated.  monthly reconciliation adjustments should be applied to claims. cms should build a portal to present accurate, up-to-date, timely information to acos rather than forcing acos to use third party vendors to interpret cms data.\nmultiple alternative payment model pathways\ncms should provide multiple kinds of payment models for physician-led organizations that allow shared-savings, more appropriate levels of financial risk and other payment methods.  this is the most important change that cms could make to encourage efficient, independent physician practices and other physician groups to participate in alternative models.\nprovide additional upfront payments to assist physician-led acos\nin the proposed rule, cms acknowledged that acos must make significant upfront investments in enhanced services and care management infrastructure that can only be recovered through shared savings payments.  however, the medicare physician fee schedule does not provide adequate payment for high-value services, such as the utilization of case managers. further, if acos reduce billable services, they will lose revenue and may not be able cover their costs until cms makes a shared savings payment.\nas the ama has commented, for acos to reduce medicare sending without harming quality of care for patients, participating physicians need to be paid appropriately for delivering the right mix of services to patients, not just receive a financial bonus when fewer services are delivered.  because acos are held accountable for total medicare spending, acos should be paid upfront for (non-billable) services they need to deliver in order to reduce spending and improve quality.\nuntil more primary care and specialty care alternative payment models are available for physicians, it is essential that the mssp provide different payment methods.\nthe cma concurs with the ama recommendation for cms to create a mechanism whereby physicians in acos can receive upfront payments to support services that are currently not reimbursed under standard medicare payment systems.  acos could identify the payments they need based on the delivery changes they are making.  we also agree that there should be accountability for such upfront payments if utilization or spending is not reduced.\n\n", "0397": "see attached file(s) october 16, 2018\n the honorable seema verma administrator centers for medicare

macra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally applicable nominal amount standard of 3 percent. again, the practices we work with are some of the most able to succeed in transitioning to value-based care for the medicare population, but are also by nature and practice the most risk-averse (which is in large part how they have survived as rural, independent practices serving medicare beneficiaries in areas with limited numbers of healthcare providers) hp aco strongly opposes major reductions in shared savings rates from the current track 1 shared savings rate of 50 percent to as low as 25 percent under the proposed basic track levels a and b.  as an independent rural aco this decrease in the shared savings rate would make it impossible for us to continue the level of care we feel we are providing our beneficiaries.   being an aim-funded track 1 aco we both, hp aco and cms, have first-hand knowledge regarding the cost it takes to run an aco.  small independent rural practices, that want to stay independent, do not have the funds required to continually sustain the costs of running an aco without the anticipation of obtaining the 50% shared savings rate.  national association of acos (naacos) reported that naacos members report spending almost $2 million a year on average for mssp participation, including investments made in health information technology, population health management and aco administration. we ask you to reconsider reducing the shared savings rate to 25% for basic track levels a & b. risk adjustment key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 hp aco urges cms to implement the same risk adjustment policy across medicare programs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 as an interim step to implementing consistent risk adjustment policies across medicare programs, hp aco supports the proposal to modify mssp risk adjustment by eliminating the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 hp aco appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to allow risk score changes during an agreement period but urges the agency to use a more appropriate range of +/- 6 percent and to cap the risk ratios in aggregate across the four beneficiary enrollment types. appropriate risk adjustment and benchmarking are absolutely crucial to acos with smaller numbers of beneficiaries like ours \u00e2\u0080\u0093 see our case example below. hp aco has had negative consequences based on capping of the risk score that was reported to cms. here is a synopsis of our issue: hp aco encountered a significant attribution issue which attributed to our risk score capping issue.  in short, our initial attribution that created our baseline benchmark for shared savings included a large number (approximately 27% of our total originally-attributed beneficiaries) of relatively healthy retirees of a large employer in one of our aco communities.  the retirees of this employer moved into a medicare advantage (ma) plan in late 2015, just prior to our mssp aco start in january of 2016.  therefore, our attribution dropped by over 2300 immediately from the benchmark attribution to our first aco attribution, with most of this drop attributable to this large employer shift to\nma.  additionally, this specific group of beneficiaries had significantly lower costs than our average aco \n attribution compared to $9601.11 per beneficiary in 2015 for the remaining beneficiaries. these beneficiaries also had a significantly lower risk score. as a result of the move of these beneficiaries to ma, we obviously have had no opportunity to care for these beneficiaries in our aco, yet they are included in the baseline attribution and risk score, which impacts our financial performance, not only in year 1 but moving forward. after consulting with actuaries, we discovered that the demographic reversion process/risk score capping had a significant negative impact on hp aco relative to the majority of acos.  in 2016, had there not been risk capping hp aco would have received approximately\n2.88% additional shared savings that would have been enough to pay off the remainder of our aim \n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 hp aco opposes cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed introduction of a new optional assignment method, the beneficiary opt-in assignment methodology, and instead we urge cms to improve upon the current voluntary alignment process by creating an automated system to support this assignment methodology. hp aco has concerns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals to modify the voluntary alignment process to include specialists in the voluntary assignment process if the beneficiary elects such a professional as his/her primary clinician. specifically, we have concerns regarding unintended consequences of this policy, and we request cms not to finalize this proposal. we recommend at a minimum if cms finalizes its proposal to include specialists in the voluntary alignment process it use an approach that overrides the existing claims based assignment methodology only when a beneficiary has at least one qualified primary care service (based on the existing services used for mssp assignment) during the previous or current performance year with an aco professional as defined under step 1 or step 2 of mssp assignment. hp aco also opposes cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed introduction of a new optional assignment method, the beneficiary opt-in assignment methodology. we have concerns regarding the complexity introduced by this methodology and request cms instead focus its attention on improving the voluntary alignment methodology which remains underutilized. unlike medicare advantage, acos cannot restrict a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice of provider. additionally, the retrospective aco patient attribution process is such that an aco does not know which patients are ultimately attributed to the aco until after the performance period has ended. therefore, the aco must employ strategies to coordinate the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care regardless of whether the patient may or may not be attributed to the aco and despite the fact that the patient may ultimately choose a low-performing provider outside of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s network to receive certain portions of his or her care. this makes the model one of the most consumer-directed population health models cms deploys. conclusion: acos have been instrumental in the shift to value-based care.  and aa central part of the aco concept is to transform healthcare through meaningful clinical and operational changes to put patients first by improving their care and reducing unnecessary expenditures. the mssp remains a voluntary program, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to have the right balance of risk and reward to continue program growth and success. program changes that deter new entrants would shut off a pipeline of beginner acos that should be encouraged to embark on the journey to value, which is a long-standing bipartisan goal of the administration and congress and an important aspect of the quality payment program. unique dynamics affect physicians and practices in rural areas of our country, and require thoughtful consideration to allow those practices to continue down this value-based purchasing path and provide world-class healthcare for the medicare beneficiaries in our practices and communities. we urge the agency to consider the feedback outlined in this letter. thank you for your consideration of our comments.\n\n\n\n sincerely,\n don klitgaard, md, faafp don klitgaard, md, faafp ceo, medlink advantage

centers for medicare and medicaid services hubert h. humphrey building 200 independence avenue, sw washington, dc 20201\n re: medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations--pathways to success\n dear ms. verma,\n on behalf of the coalition to transform advanced care (c-tac), we appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this proposed rule in regard to its effects on those living with advanced illness.\n c-tac is a national non-partisan, not-for-profit organization dedicated to ensuring that all those living with advanced illness, especially the sickest and most vulnerable, receive comprehensive, high- quality, person- and family-centered care that is consistent with their goals and values and honors their dignity. c-tac is made up of over 140 national and regional organizations including patient and consumer advocacy groups, practitioners, health plans, faith-based and community organizations, and others who share a common vision of improving advanced illness care in the u.s.\n c-tac\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definition of advanced illness is when one or more conditions becomes serious enough that general health and functioning begin to decline, treatment may no longer lead to preferred outcomes, and care oriented toward comfort may take precedence over attempts to cure \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a process that extends to the end of life and that for some individuals and their families may lead to transition to hospice.\n we have several comments on this proposed rule as various sections will impact the care of those with advanced illness. specifically:\n\n 2 on risk. many will not have the needed claims data in time to make necessary organizational changes.  therefore, we recommend a longer period for both tracks to get to 2-sided risk.\n expand use of telehealth for practitioners in acos in performance-based risk arrangements c-tac is in support of increased flexibility for acos using telehealth as this will be helpful for those advanced illness management programsi using remote contact with patients. having 24/7 access is a key factor in avoiding emergency department visits or hospitalizationsii and so allowing practitioners to use telehealth could help reduce unnecessary utilization. we also support the ability of those patients to contact their aco practitioners from their home as this is the setting where most with advanced illness, and their families, are and want to be.\n we would also encourage cms to expand access to telehealth for beneficiaries in other medicare programs for the same reasons as above.\n expand skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver eligibility c-tac is in support of expanding this waiver as it will promote innovation and more person- centered care. although requiring patients to have an at least 3-day hospitalization should insure that only those who most need skilled nursing care qualify for it, it is inappropriate to hospitalize someone with snf needs just to get medicare coverage for a needed snf stay. medicare advantage (ma) plans are able to admit patients directly to snfs with a similar waiver and we agree that acos should have the same ability.\n moving beyond this waiver, we would also encourage cms to allow acos additional flexibility, such as those that medicare advantage organizations have in regard to offering supplemental benefits like home-based palliative care, transportation, or nutritional support. these would improve both the care and quality of life for those living with advanced illness and their families.\n beneficiary incentive programs we are in favor of programs that incentivize beneficiaries to participate in services that \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvance a clinical goal\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 including adherence to a treatment or drug regime, adherence to a follow-up care plan, or management of a chronic disease or condition\u00e2\u0080\u009d. those living with advanced illness usually have multiple chronic illnesses and programs that help them manage those illnesses can improve quality of life for them and their familiesiii. we appreciate that this proposed rule would give acos the flexibility to determine which types of incentives or vouchers to use as long as those incentives \u00e2\u0080\u009chave a reasonable connection to the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical care\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n 3 coordination and other benefits that come with that enrollment. we would only suggest that any notification make very clear that beneficiaries are not limited to getting their care only from the aco, but can see other practitioners or providers if needed, and that those notifications not be administratively burdensome on acos.\n primary care providers we very much support this proposed change as it will allow specialists like palliative care practitioners to be considered primary care providers for an aco. we also strongly support expanding the type of primary care practitioner to include nurse practitioner and physician assistants. many palliative care programs use these kinds of practitioners to deliver carev. our only concern in expanding this flexibility, however, is a practical one of whether the practitioners will be on interoperable information systems and able to reach the cehrt threshold.\n revisions to the definition of primary care services used in beneficiary assignment we are also strongly in support of this change and, specifically, the inclusion of advance care planning as a primary care service. although all beneficiaries should engage in advance care planning, no one knows when they might become  incapacitated, this is of particular importance and benefit to those with advanced illness who are more likely to do so. including these activities in the aco primary care services should encourage providers to have advance care planning conversations with their patients.\n however, the proposed rule mentions the proposal from the earlier physician fee schedule to remove the highest intensity evaluation and management (e/m) codes and collapse down to only two codes, which we strongly object to. an ama analysisvi showed that removing e/m levels 4 and 5 would reduce payment for office visits for hospice practitioners alone by 20%, not to mention the impact to critically important geriatricians and palliative care practitioners. we also understand that the proposed add-on payments would not be sufficient to offset these payment reductions. we therefore strongly recommend that these e/m changes not be made and urge cms to ensure that any simplification in coding/billing not discourage practitioners from spending the needed time with complex/advanced illness patients or promote more frequent, shorter interactions, which would be burdensome for such patients.  the currently proposed reduction from the five levels to only two and eliminating the ones for the most complex interactions unfortunately do both.\n\n 4 includes specific measures for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersons without cancer\u00e2\u0080\u009d but we request that those measures be modified to also include persons on palliative care or hospice.\n looking beyond these opioid-related quality measures, we encourage cms to consider ones that promote better care for those with advanced illness such as timely referral to hospice.\n thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule.  if you have any questions, please contact marian grant, senior regulatory advisor, c-tac, at 443-742-8872 or

be \n held responsible for managing a full year of expenditures while only eligible to share in a half year of savings. . additionally, acos will not know who may be attributed to them in population b until july 2019, but will be held responsible for expenditures for those beneficiaries from january 1, 2019.\n3. to manage and deploy resources for the two populations, an aco would have to scale up \n infrastructure and resources despite only needing those resources for performance year 2019.\n\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 recommendation:\n1. use a singular assignment window (10/1/2017-9/30/2018) and methodology (mssp \n track 3) to determine the assigned population for the entire calendar year 2019. this will remove the challenges associated with population churn and the mismatch between at- risk

& human services attention: cms-1701-p\np.o. box 8016 \n baltimore, md 21244-8016\n re: cms-1701-p, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success\n 2\n cchn opposes a few key aspects of the recent proposed pathways to success rule, in particular the agency's proposal to cut acos shared savings rates below 50 percent, reduce the time in a shared savings-only model from six to two years, and application of a +/- 3 percent risk adjustment cap across an extended agreement period.\n these proposed changes will harm patients and providers by limiting improvements in savings and quality acos provide, while slowing progress made in transitioning to value-base payments. colorado\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fqhc- controlled aco, chpa, has made a significant investment in funding the operations to support the mssp, and a reduction in potential savings will greatly impact their ability to reinvest in care models/teams and will significantly limit their ability to generate enough capital to meet the repayment mechanism requirements.  as a non-profit, low revenue aco, chpa may be forced out of the mssp because they will lack the capital required for the repayment mechanism. chpa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial intention was to build up that capital over the course of six years under the current system, but that timeline is drastically reduced with the proposed changes.\n cchn appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recognition of the additional time many provider-led acos may need to transition to higher levels of two-sided risk by allowing provider-led acos to cycle through the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasic\u00e2\u0080\u009d track for two agreement periods.  however, this still only allows provider-led acos two years before taking on financial risk. due to the pace of data sharing and the imperative to transform care models, cchn recommends cms allow provider-led acos an even more gradual pathway to two-sided risk. specifically, that cms allow provider-led acos a minimum of three years in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasic\u00e2\u0080\u009d track in an upside-only arrangement.\n while  cchn  supports  incorporating  regional  expenditures  in  the  benchmark  established  for  an  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  first agreement,  we  are  concerned  that  the  two  proposed  policies  to  limit  the  magnitude  of  the  adjustment undermines the policy goals. as cms has recognized, the incorporation of regional expenditures provides an aco with a benchmark that is more reflective of ffs spending in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s region than a benchmark based solely on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own historical expenditures. this approach creates stronger financial incentives for acos that  have  been  successful  in  reducing  expenditures  to  remain  in  the  program,  thus  improving  program sustainability. it also allows cms to better capture the cost experience in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s region, the health status and  socio-economic  dynamics  of  the  regional  population,  and  location-specific  medicare  payments  when compared to using national ffs expenditures.\n cchn disagrees that higher weights for the regional adjustment results in potential windfall gains to lower-cost acos. those gains are not windfalls, but instead compensate lower-cost acos for the work invested in practices to reduce the overall costs of care for medicare beneficiaries. in fact, a lower-cost aco composed of fqhcs may have higher expenditures for primary care due to the prospective payment system (pps) methodology as compared to regional expenditures for primary care services that are generally reimbursed under the medicare fee schedule.  the risk adjustment benchmarking cap uniquely will harm our non-profit fqhc-based aco. in the past, fqhcs coding processes were fairly rudimentary which is evidenced by our unusually low risk adjustment scores and unusually low benchmarks given the patient population we serve. chpa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understanding of risk adjustment is relatively new, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve implemented coding improvement efforts to more accurately reflect the acuity of their patients and to better capture hcc codes annually.  the proposed limit of +/-3% would stifle efforts to improve in these crucial areas which impact our ability to be successful in the mssp.\n cchn supports a number of proposals in the rule and encourages cms to finalize its proposals to: 1) move to five-year agreement periods; 2) reduce burdens related to quality reporting; 3) expand the use of waivers for telehealth and skilled nursing facility stays; and 4) provide flexibility with choosing assignment methodology regardless of risk model.\n 3\n cms to clarify the language in the proposed rule in order to clearly allow fqhcs to provide this valuable service through their work in an aco.\n fqhcs are unique in that they are both required by federal law and committed to serving everyone that seeks care and must serve communities most in need of care. they turn no patient away, regardless of income, insurance status, risk, or complexity. this open-door policy is a defining feature of the fqhc mission of providing quality, affordable access to care to all who need it. additionally, beneficiary freedom of choice is an important way for practices and payers, including medicare, to gauge practice effectiveness and the demand for access to health care services in specific communities. should cms decide to allow acos to incentivize beneficiaries, it should implement safeguards to ensure that higher-revenue acos do not inadvertently attract healthier patients, potentially skewing quality metrics and leaving sicker patients with fewer options.\n thank you again for your work on behalf of patients and providers to advance value-based payment. we appreciate your interest in sustaining the success of medicare acos and creating an environment where providers are encouraged to enter into value-based payment arrangements and help patients receive high- quality, coordinate care.\n

administrator centers for medicare & medicaid services 200 independence ave., s.w. washington, dc 20201 dear administrator verma: this letter serves to provide comments on the centers for medicare & medicaid services proposed rule that would redesign the medicare shared savings program (mssp), encouraging organizations to transition to two\u00e2\u00ad sided risk models. mercy health select, llc has participated in the mssp since its inception, having completed one contract period in track 1 and currently participating in track 3, with our contract set to expire december 31, 2018. we embraced the migration to risk by moving into track 3 in 2016, and continue to support two sided-risk models. as we evaluate our upcoming renewal options, and review the proposed rule, we are concerned that the proposed administration of the 2019 performance year could lead to unintended consequences that adversely impact us. first we'll address the two issues that pertain to the administration of peeformance year 2019 mssp track 3/pathwavs to success: enhanced track, primarily the calculations as described in sections 11.a.7.b.2. and 11.a.7.b.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n method choices made available to beneficiaries for various notifications. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 defining primary care services. in accordance with provisions of the 21st century cures act and bba 2018, for performance years 2019 and thereafter cms proposes to update the definition of primary care services that is used when assigning beneficiaries to acos (in combination with the applicable mssp track's assignment methodology). services that would satisfy the revised definition include some existing current procedural terminology (cpt) codes (e.g., advance care planning) and healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) g-codes (e.g., depression screening) along with new g-codes proposed elsewhere in the rule (e.g., complexity inherent in office visits for certain specialties). cms also proposes to more accurately distinguish short-term, rehabilitation-related evaluation and management services provided in nursing facilities from ongoing primary care services furnished to longer-term nursing facility residents. cms would identify the former services by linking the appropriate cpt codes to nursing facility claims for the same dates of service rather than relying on the place of service code for snfs (code 31) as listed on the professional claim. mercy health select supports the changes as proposed and agrees with cms that linking snf facility claims by date of service to professional claims will better identify short-term, rehabilitation-focused care that should not be counted as primary care services that contribute to beneficiary assignment to acos.\n\n\n", "0403": "i.basic track\r\na.acos predominantly made up of critical access hospitals (cahs) are not in a position to take on downside risk given the inherent volatility in cost-based reimbursement. forcing these rural acos to exit the mssp would result in a loss of access to claims data, reducing the value of significant investments these acos have made (to date) to redesign rural healthcare delivery. medicares current proposal fails to provide a viable alternative for apm participation for rural acos.\r\n\r\nii.new screening criteria\r\na.medicares proposal places unnecessary regulatory oversight on acos that are negative outside corridor. new acos, and acos that expand participant lists during the agreement period, will face challenges as a result of learning curves and a lack of experience. these hurdles could reasonably result in poor financial performance twice out of a 5-year agreement period. the threat of termination does not add any new meaningful incentives for acos to avoid poor financial results, given no aco seeks to lose money (let alone repay medicare after financial reconciliation). terminating acos from the mssp without allowing sufficient time to implement necessary population health, care management, and data strategies to enhance beneficiary care and contain costs represents a fundamental disservice to the mssp and runs counter to research that suggests acos do face learning curves throughout the course of mssp participation. additionally, medicare points out in this proposed rule that numerous factors can impact the financial benchmark and its predictability (e.g., aco participant list changes, regulatory adjustments to assignment methodologies, and variation due to annual risk adjustment); thereby directly impacting an acos ability to generate savings year-over-year of the agreement.\r\n\r\niii.beneficiary incentive program\r\na.medicares proposed beneficiary incentive program would encourage beneficiaries to receive important primary care services, with the intent to assist in maintenance and improvement in health. the proposal represents an opportunity to further engage assigned beneficiaries and have them play a more active role in their healthcare. however, the proposal as it currently stands places significant burden on acos as it requires a database to track and annually report on results of the acos beneficiary incentive program. the mssp already requires each aco to have a compliance plan and controls in place to ensure compliance with mssp requirements. the burdensome compliance requirements associated with the beneficiary incentive program may discourage many acos from employing such a program.\r\n\r\niv.annual cehrt attestation\r\na.medicares proposal suggests that an aco would be required to attest to the percentage of eligible clinicians utilizing cehrt at the beginning of the calendar year. this beginning-of-the-year attestation would negatively impact acos whose aco participants make cehrt decisions (such as upgrades) based on minimum reporting periods set forth by the quality payment program. for instance, the 2015 edition of cehrt is required in calendar year 2019. however, the minimum reporting period in 2019 is a consecutive 90-day period, meaning some aco participants may not be on the 2015 edition of cehrt until october 2nd, 2019. thus, the 2019 attestation would not count eligible clinicians who are not yet using the 2015 edition of cehrt, and could drop the respective aco below the cehrt use threshold. medicare should implement an end-of-year attestation to mitigate this issue.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     ", "0404": "see

organizations.\r\n\r\nin previous years, a version of this same requirement was in place and required a cms template be used. our experience with this notification was an outcome of very confused medicare patients who expressed feelings of fear that their benefits and/or network would be changed. the template letter was hard for patients to understand. patients automatically jumped to the

across north america, europe, united kingdom, the middle east, and asia pacific.\n 2\n\n we are committed to assisting cms in supporting the shift to value-based care delivery and facilitating greater data exchange across the healthcare community through mssp. the program incentivizes providers to improve quality, and reduce cost as well as resource utilization, which are efforts that require greater coordination in ways that would likely not occur in a typical fee- for-service environment.\n himss recognizes that technology and evidence-based medicine are helping our nation to transition from a fee-for-service system to a value-based care system.  a critical piece of that transition is the ability to securely exchange timely health information between settings and providers of care, with patients and family members, and using that information to achieve improved outcomes as well as maximizing value for patients\u00e2\u0080\u0094all key tenets of mssp as well as acos.\n for our public comment, himss offers the following thoughts and recommendations on this nprm:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 support for the proposed agreement period and reconsideration of the length of the glide path to two-sided risk\n himss has previously expressed its interest in extending the initial three-year agreement period for an additional two years in our letter to cms on february 5, 2015. in this nprm, himss applauds cms for addressing the issue of extending and modifying the agreements periods from three years to five years to allow for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgentler on ramp\u00e2\u0080\u009d for all tracks. also, the certainty of a five- year agreement will be more reassuring to providers for making that initial investment in becoming a program participant.\n himss appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest to move providers towards risk-based payment models but cautions that moving too rapidly by shortening the length of time in which acos can participate in an upside-only model from six years to two years may negatively affect participation in the program.  we believe that a balance of risk and reward must be maintained to ensure the success of mssp. there is great diversity among clinician practices in their experience with risk-based payments that must be taken into account, especially given that mssp is a voluntary endeavor.\n we are also reassured by the recent cms data release\u00e2\u0080\u0094mssp is working successfully and acos are providing savings to medicare and delivering high-quality care to beneficiaries.  the 2017 cms data indicate that 472 mssp acos are caring for 9 million medicare beneficiaries, which secured a total of $1.1 billion in savings, with $780 million in shared savings to participating providers and $314 million in savings to medicare.  in addition, the average aco in the program attained 92 percent on the required quality scores.  overall, the program, as currently constituted, is working and such data support our position for a longer glide path to acos assuming two-sided risk.\n 3\n joining. we observe that motivating more participants to join mssp and other cms aco models can help to promote the maturity of the foundational technology needed to support these reforms.\n while many of these care delivery models are still progressing, they play a key role in health it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evolution as well, by helping to encourage the adoption of interoperability standards, and enhance design and usability of health it tools in order to meet provider, patient, and caregiver workflow needs. as clinicians continue to increase their understanding of risk-based models and the push to value-based care in future years, himss supports the idea of allowing more time for acos in a shared-savings only model if the aco is meeting certain cost and quality benchmarks to ensure that there is an equilibrium going forward.\n additionally, himss recommends utilizing a shared savings rate of at least the current 50 percent, as opposed to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed 20 percent.  given the considerable investment that acos have to make to join the program, lowering the sharing rate is counterintuitive as well as counterproductive.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 endorsement of the expansion of the use of telehealth services in acos\n enabling technologies and services such as telehealth are critical for the success of an aco to meet the tenets of the program and improve active care coordination for beneficiaries. as discussed in a himss-personal connected health alliance letter to the federal communications commission from february 2018, trends suggest that rural communities across the country are falling behind when it comes to the availability of high-quality healthcare. by improving rural healthcare provider access to modern communications services, mssp can help in overcoming some of the obstacles to healthcare delivery faced by rural and isolated communities.\n as technology and telehealth assume an increasingly critical role in healthcare delivery, widespread inclusion in mssp is more vital than ever to help realize its potential. himss is supportive of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand the use of telehealth for practitioners in acos in performance-based risk arrangements and expanding coverage for some telehealth and telemedicine in mssp to areas that are not designated as rural or shortage zones through limited waivers. in addition, we ask cms to consider applying waivers as broadly as is permissible on statutory and regulatory restrictions related to telehealth to expand access to telehealth services\n(i.e., waivers on originating site restrictions and geographic areas where telehealth services are \n allowed).\n as previously stated in our himss letter to cms on february 5, 2015, we encourage cms to share information that it collects from acos on the use of technology that would be helpful to other providers and stakeholders looking to adopt as well as promote the adoption of telehealth services. sharing this information can inform potential telehealth providers about its benefits and also help identify and address potential challenges and obstacles.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 reinforce the use of electronic clinical quality measures and enhance available reporting options\n 4\n support. himss demonstrated its interest in improving clinical quality measurement in our letter to cms on may 31, 2018.  in this letter, himss emphasized that quality reporting policies should strive to enhance the value proposition of participating in quality reporting programs and ensure that electronic clinical quality measures (ecqms) are actionable for hospitals, providers, and patients to drive improvement in care outcomes. all ecqms should be fully tested for validity, reliability and feasibility which produces comparable and consistent results, an accurate reflection of care delivered, and be actionable to drive meaningful improvements in care delivery.\n cms has echoed these recommendations in the framework of the meaningful measures initiative and himss appreciates the thoughtful consideration of the meaningful measures criteria as cms evolves mssp.  we support the idea that the accuracy and the ability to report measures across the nation are better supported by capturing the actual clinical data elements that demonstrate a quality measure was met.  while himss believes that the cms web interface is an acceptable method and offers some flexibility for group reporting for mssp, it is less than ideal in many ways.  for example, a single annual submission of data on a sample of medicare patients does not reflect the true quality of care across these reported measures. the process also requires manual abstraction which is inefficient and burdensome.\n in addition, the cms web interface does not give providers visibility on measure performance on an ongoing basis throughout the year, limiting their ability for true performance improvement. as cms continues to move towards reimbursement models focused on outcomes, himss recommends cms encourage eligible clinicians to utilize ecqms as a tool to make measures more actionable and explore reporting ecqm data for quality reporting in mssp. organizations, including himss members involved with the feasibility testing of de-novo ecqms designed to extract data from an electronic health record (ehr)-enabled clinical workflow, have indicated that significant progress is being made to extract meaningful clinical data from ehrs while minimally affecting current workflow.\n several application programming interfaces (apis) are available to improve interoperability and to facilitate electronic quality reporting. this capability continues to evolve rapidly and should be leveraged to improve quality of care and reduce reporting burden. himss endorses the reporting of quality measures as ecqms for mssp as well as for other cms aco programs.\n himss also supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to remove the certified ehr technology (cehrt) utilization quality measure from the mssp quality measure set. as proposed in this rule, an mssp aco is required to attest that 50 percent or more eligible clinicians in that aco are using cehrt to document and communicate clinical care to their patients or other health care providers, rather than the data capture typically required for a quality measure.  this proposal alleviates a significant burden on eligible clinicians, and such an attestation tool capitalizes on cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audit power. overall, this step reinforces the utilization of cehrt as a tool to minimize clinician burden as well as supports broader care transformation efforts.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 broad support for the inclusion of beneficiary incentives that leads to more patient engagement opportunities\n 5\n information and technology tools play a critical role in advancing this paradigm.  we believe acos that engage beneficiaries in the management of their health care may achieve better outcomes and experience greater success in the shared savings program.\n himss appreciates the significant flexibility granted to mssp acos in this proposed rule to offer beneficiary incentives to encourage patient engagement, promote care coordination, and achieve the objectives of the program.  the ability for acos to target their incentives to beneficiaries who are most likely to achieve the clinical goal that the incentive is intended to advance is helpful. although beneficiary incentives will need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the examples provided in the proposed rule will assist providers as they think about where to best employ and direct an incentive program.  we are particularly interested in incentives focused on the mitigation of a chronic disease or condition, or chronic disease self-management, as these areas may be best- suited for greater patient engagement and intervention, and more significant impact on the broader healthcare system.\n himss also encourages cms to look at alternatives to the requirements about only acos participating under certain two-sided risk models being allowed to establish beneficiary incentive programs to provide incentive payments to assigned beneficiaries who receive qualifying services. given that such programs are in their nascent phase, allowing more kinds of cms acos the opportunity to undertake these beneficiary programs could provide more of a research base about what works for different kinds of beneficiaries, from different backgrounds, and with different conditions.  this kind of information would provide valuable lessons learned and model practices that could be built on in the future to expand and strengthen these programs across all healthcare settings.\n himss recognizes that technology and evidence-based medicine are helping our nation to transition from a fee-for-service system to a value-based care system.  a critical piece of that transition is the ability to securely exchange timely health information between settings and providers of care, with patients and family members, and using that information to achieve improved outcomes as well as maximizing value for patients\u00e2\u0080\u0094all key tenets of acos and mssp.\n we look forward to the opportunity to further discuss these issues in more depth. please feel free to contact jeff coughlin, senior director of federal & state affairs, at 703.562.8824, or eli fleet, director of federal affairs, at 703.562.8834, with questions or for more information.\n thank you for your consideration.\n sincerely,\n\n harold f. wolf iii, fhimss president & ceo himss\n\n\n\n", "0407": "determining experienced vs. inexperienced based on participant providers (tin and npi) rather than the aco puts new acos at a substantial disadvantage. in our market most providers have at some point been in an aco, this does not necessarily equate to the aco being experienced. using this as a determinant is detrimental to the shared savings program.\r\n\r\ncms should allow acos, npis and tins to go to a lower level of shared savings if they do not have the financial resources to go to risk. acos that have actually achieved savings but do not have the financial resources to go to risk are being forced out of the program.\r\n\r\nvoluntary alignment beneficiary is assigned to an aco if they voluntarily selected a pcp within the aco. this is not changed after initial selection for the entire performance year - even if the participant never actually sees that pcp. this puts the provider in the position of being responsible for coordinating care for a patient they may have never seen, or saw only once. we request that you consider actual claims or allow the beneficiary to revise their selection in order to avoid having a provider put in this impossible situation. deemphasizing claims base will negatively impact aco success as patients often see specialists far more often than the pcp they select. additionally, there will be confusion between ma and opt-in aco for the beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nonce an aco moves to risk, the revenue for the shareholder entities is considered when setting the shared loss limit (all part a and part b revenue). some acos have shareholders that are large hospital systems but own only a small portion of the aco and do not provide a substantial amount of funding to the aco. our aco would have to close its doors if all shareholder income for the other entities they own was considered when setting the shared loss limit.\r\n\r\nafter an aco is in level e on the basic track and must move to the enhanced track shared losses move from 4% to 15%. that is a huge jump to have to take all at once. we suggest a tiered approach to bridge from 4% to 15% more gradually.\r\n\r\nchanges in regional benchmarking looks like acos may be forced to use national trending for the first contract rather than regional. this is a disadvantage to most acos. national trend has never had the effect desired by cms & it does not level the policy between urban and rural acos. we urge you to use regional benchmarking in the first contract period as well as the subsequent contract periods.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n

(philips), i am pleased to have the opportunity to comment on the august 9, 2018 accountable care organization (aco) proposed rule. (the \u00e2\u0080\u009caco proposed rule\u00e2\u0080\u009d). philips provides solutions that span the health continuum, including imaging, patient monitoring, and cardiac care systems; medical alert systems; sleep management and respiratory solutions; healthcare informatics solutions and services; and a complete range of comprehensive telehealth programs.\nphilips\u00e2\u0080\u0099 support of integrated healthcare delivery\nphilips strongly supports the current emphasis on integrated healthcare delivery, and we recognize that acos have been at the forefront of the incorporation of these concepts into the us healthcare system.  with this transformation in mind, philips is dedicated to ensuring that all of our product lines facilitate the delivery of patient-centered, high-value care to the patients served by our provider partners.\na number of our product lines are at the forefront of the transition to value-based care. philips is pleased that it is serving the provider community by offering the information system and patient management capabilities of philips wellcentive.  for more than a decade, wellcentive has managed quality for providers and healthcare stakeholders in health system, physician practice, medicare shared saving program (mssp), integrated delivery network (idn) hospital, employer, and, more recently, payer settings. these stakeholders are pursuing an intricate array of value-based care and population health management initiatives. wellcentive maintains more than 400 reportable clinical quality measures (cqms), ranging from national quality forum and hedis measures to more than 30 certified meaningful use measures. by combining clinical, pre-adjudicated and adjudicated claims data for analysis and reporting, and by capturing data across disparate systems, we are bridging the movement of quality from process to outcomes measures.  through wellcentive\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data governance  platform, we are aligning independent and employed providers using multiple ehr systems toward the common goal of an enhanced patient experience, and quality and cost improvement. philips wellcentive currently supports track 1 and next generation acos, and is a member of the national association of acos (naacos).\nin addition, philips recently acquired forcare, a leading innovator in open-standards-based interoperability software solutions that facilitate fast and flawless data flows between medical systems and information sources at the departmental and enterprise levels, as well as health information exchanges (hies) across health systems.\nforcare will enable philips to deliver more effective, seamlessly integrated informatics solutions that improve clinical workflow, enhance patient care and optimize enterprise management.  as hospital and health systems continue to consolidate, the need for seamless enterprise integration is paramount for delivering efficient, quality care. the combination of philips\u00e2\u0080\u0099 advanced clinical informatics solutions for data (e.g. \u0013 hyperlink

\\t \"_blank\" \u0014intellispace universal data manager\u0015), workflow (e.g. \u0013 hyperlink

complementary interoperability platform will enable philips to strengthen its leadership in connecting patient information across the health continuum.\nalso, we also believe that telehealth specifically and the remote provision of healthcare services generally plays a critical role in facilitating value-based care in the aco and other settings. while philips provides health care products and services that span the health continuum, we believe that coordinated programs facilitating the remote provision of health care services are among the most cost-effective solutions to systematically manage patient populations with ongoing needs, particularly those with medically complex and/or chronic conditions.  philips\u00e2\u0080\u0099 remote access programs are designed to enable providers to coordinate care across the continuum for patients ranging from those who require chronic management to patients with complex, high-risk conditions requiring acute intervention.  these programs include the remote intensive care program (eicu\u00e2\u00ae), a comprehensive technology and clinical reengineering program that enables health care professionals from a centralized telehealth center to provide around-the-clock care for critically ill patients; eacute program, which is modeled after the eicu, and monitors high-risk hospitalized patients on medical-surgical floors to  prevent avoidable complications, and econsultant program, which provides remote management services to skilled nursing facilities (snfs) and emergency department (ed) consults for telestroke, telepsych and trauma triage; and the intensive ambulatory care (eiac) program, enables our provider partners to  manage high-risk patients with multiple chronic conditions in the home.\nour general observations\nwe agree in principle that aspects of the proposed rule seeking to accelerate acos into a true value-based care model through some level of risk through a sustained time period is aligned with our goals of medicare sustainability and the movement to quality.\nwe would also agree overall that two years of non-risk bearing participation, down from the current six-year time period, is a realistic approach. we strongly recommend, though, that cutting non-risk bearing aco shared savings from 50% to 25% during this two-year period will disincentivize many current track 1 programs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and organizations considering joining the mssp program \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from continued or new participation.\nphilips recommendation: in line with the sept. 4, 2018 letter to cms from the house ways and means committee, we urge cms to maintain a 50% shared savings rate for non-risk bearing acos in the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final rule. this will motivate continued participation and new participation within a two-year non-risk bearing timeline.\nsecondly, we appreciate the proposed rule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s providing existing track 1 acos an additional six months to determine whether they will continue to participate in the program\u00e2\u0080\u0094until july 1, 2019 rather than january 1, 2018.  however,  we believe the july 1, 2019 implementation date is too soon,  given the complexities and considerations all levels of participating programs must consider.\nphilips recommendation:  we recommend that track 1 acos be given additional time beyond july 1, 2019 to determine future participation. with the final rule anticipated near the end of 2018, we recommend that track 1 acos be granted until jan. 1, 2020 to commit to migration to a risk-bearing status. this additional time,  coupled with a 50% shared savings formula would, we believe, lead to overall greater participation  in the new program.  it is our understanding that he aco community  has signaled that many participating programs will simply opt out of the mssp program if the proposed rule is adopted without change, and this result  is inconsistent with  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and philips\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goals for value-based care adoption and medicare sustainability. as you know,  the aco structure  has already resulted in   a voluntary migration toward  a risk model and  these gains are worth preserving.\nfinally , under current medicare regulations, track 1+ acos are eligible to be considered advanced alternative payment models (aapms) for the purpose of macra.  if the aco proposed rule is finalized without change, it appears likely that many of these will lose aapm status:  cms is proposing that aapm status will not be available until an aco is in its fourth year of the basic track. in addition, it is not entirely clear how this revamping will impact mips acos.\nphilips recommendation: we would seek clarity within the final rule on macra aapm status for all participating acos.  we also suggest that cms seek guidance at congressional and industry levels on the proposed rule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact on macra participation. we believe that aapm status for all risk-bearing acos would provide enhanced motivation for acos to remain in the mssp program, and that a four-year cycle within the basic track would prove too limiting. cms should consider a more accelerated timeline of two years to attain aapm status.\nspecific comments.\ntelehealth and other waivers\nconsistent with bba requirements, cms is proposing to waive the telehealth originating site restrictions, beginning in january 1, 2020, for eligible physicians and practitioners in two-sided risk acos for beneficiaries that are prospectively assigned to the aco.  under the proposal, medicare payment for telehealth services that are on the telehealth list will be available to prospectively assigned medicare beneficiaries in their homes, regardless of geographic location. this policy would apply to acos entering the basic track (under a two-sided model) and enhanced track, when the aco elects prospective assignment.  cms is also seeking comment on expanding this policy to two-sided risk acos that have selected preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation, instead of prospective assignment, as their assignment methodology.\nphilips recommendation:  philips strongly supports waiver of the originating site restrictions for acos, regardless of whether beneficiaries are assigned prospectively or prospectively assigned preliminarily, with subsequent retrospective reconciliation.\nphilips recommendation: because cms has significantly expanded medicare coverage for the remote provision of services and for other care coordination services only recently, if benchmark calculations do not take these services into account, acos will be dissuaded from providing them.  we urge cms to adjust its benchmark calculations to include the cost that likely would have been incurred during the benchmark period had these services been covered during that period.\nbeneficiary incentives and other beneficiary-related provisions\nunder the aco proposed rule, certain acos could provide monetary incentives up to $20 for beneficiaries who obtain primary care from certain aco-affiliated providers.  in addition, the aco proposed rule indicates that an aco can provide vouchers (including gift cards) useable for items and services that have a \u00e2\u0080\u009creasonable connection\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical care, if the voucher is used  (a) for preventive items or services; or (b) to promote a clinical goal for the beneficiary, including adherence to a treatment or drug regime, adherence to a follow-up care plan, or management of a chronic disease or condition.\nphilips recommendation:  philips supports loosening the beneficiary inducement prohibitions for acos.   we note that cms just recently expanded the types of beneficiary inducements allowed to be provided by all providers, by adopting new regulations implementing the beneficiary inducement provisions of the medicare law. we urge the agency to ensure that the final aco regulations are consistent with these recent revisions and that  acos be allowed even more flexibility than other providers to incentivize (and disincentivize) patient behavior to achieve better quality and lower cost. .we also urge cms to clarify that beneficiary incentives that are provided in accordance with the aco final rule will be considered exempt from scrutiny under both the beneficiary inducement and the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the medicare law.\nmeaningful use (advancing interoperability) provisions\ncms is proposing to establish new program requirements related to the adoption of certified electronic health record technology (cehrt) by eligible clinicians participating in acos.\u00e2\u00a0 specifically, cms is proposing to discontinue the use of the meaningful use electronic health record quality measure and to require instead that acos attest that a specified percentage of their eligible clinicians use cehrt: acos that are participating in a track or a payment model within a track that is not an advanced apm would be required to attest that at least 50 percent of their eligible clinicians use cehrt.\u00e2\u00a0 acos that are participating in a track or payment model within a track that is an advanced apm would be required to attest to the higher of 50 percent or the cehrt threshold required for advanced apms.\nphilips recommendation: while we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to utilize its regulatory authority to encourage the transition to interoperability in accordance with the office of the national coordinator, we are concerned that adoption of the 2015 edition of cehrt by vendors serving private practice physicians is not widespread, especially among smaller practices.  for this reason, revising the advancing interoperability requirements for acos  in the manner proposed has the potential to exclude from participation all but the most integrated of health care systems.  we urge cms to examine the available data on vendor and therefore physician practice adoption of the 2015 edition of cehrt before finalizing this proposed requirement.\nwe appreciate the opportunity to comment on the aco proposed rule.  please do not hesitate to contact me at \u0013 hyperlink

section ii.c.2.c \u00e2\u0080\u0093 proposals for beneficiary incentive programs\n cerner would like clarification on if a single beneficiary can receive more than one monetary incentive per year. the language of the rule clearly caps the incentive at $20, but the cap appears to be a per qualifying visit cap and not an annual per beneficiary cap. we would like for cms to clearly state which it is.\n cerner would also like clarification from cms on if a beneficiary can deny the receipt of a monetary incentive. if a beneficiary can deny the monetary incentive, what would an aco need to do if a beneficiary denied payment from a monetary incentive? section ii.d.2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 risk adjustment methodology for adjusting historical benchmark for each performance year\n cerner supports

of providers properly documenting diagnosis information that contributes to hcc scores and capturing the most accurate picture of the risk level of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population compared to

electronically via: regulations.gov\n cleveland clinic (cc) is a not-for-profit, integrated healthcare system dedicated to patient care, teaching, and research. our health system is comprised of a main campus, 10 community hospitals, and 21 family health and wellness centers with over 3,600 salaried physicians and scientists. last year, our system had 7.6 million patient visits and over 220,000 hospital admissions.\n cleveland clinic is also a current participant in the medicare shared savings program track 1+, effective january of this year. this is our second contract in mssp; cleveland clinic participated in track 1 from 2015-2017. our aco includes over 100,000 assigned beneficiaries who receive care across the cleveland clinic system.\n by virtue of participation in track 1+, cleveland clinic has opted to share the financial responsibility of the cost of medicare beneficiaries with the federal government. this relationship with the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) was new this year, a decision made after careful thought and consideration.\n we understand that cms and the department of health and human services (hhs) envision a future where health systems like cleveland clinic take on greater accountability for managing the health care budgets of our patients.1 cleveland clinic does not oppose taking on financial risk; many of our contracts with government and non-government payers include such arrangements.\n however, an agreement to assume financial risk must include a pathway for cleveland clinic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and other healthcare providers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to meaningfully track and manage performance. we fear that ability is lacking in the medicare shared savings program right now. benchmarks move unpredictably year to year, and performance data lags, challenging our ability to take action. we also note that cms is amending the financial performance metrics for the medicare shared savings program yet again, suggesting that the methodology has not yet been perfected.\n we hope that cms will continue to make improvements to the medicare shared savings program that make the possibility of taking on financial risk less daunting and reflective of the shared\n 2 the cleveland clinic foundation 9500 euclid avenue / na4 cleveland, ohio 44195 tel 216 445-7445 fax 216 444-2436 morrisk@ccf.org\n responsibility between cleveland clinic and cms. we also hope that cms will continue to explore additional alternative payment models that could provide other avenues to explore financial risk.\n in support of these goals, the following are the comments of cleveland clinic in respect of the captioned proposed rule.\n participation options\n distinct participation options based on aco performance cms is proposing to create different participation options for acos based on the revenue they derive from medicare parts a and b, as well as prior experience with performance-based risk. cms cites the fact that higher revenue acos are more likely to include a hospital and, therefore, be more likely to control costs.\n we object to creating different tracks for acos based on revenue. we do not support distinct participation options for high-revenue versus low-revenue acos as proposed. acos in the medicare shared savings program should be subject to the same set of rules and performance criteria regardless of its size and makeup. to suggest the presence of revenue is necessarily tied to an advantage in managing patient populations is flawed.\n benchmarking and financial performance\n moratorium on methodology changes during contract period though this is not directly responsive to a proposal, we urge cms to refrain from imposing on participating acos any changes to the benchmark or financial performance methodology during an existing agreement period. instead, if cms makes any such changes, it should provide acos with sufficient data to assess the impact on their performance and allow them to elect whether to adopt the change immediately or to defer until the next agreement period.\n predicting and modelling financial performance in the medicare shared savings program is challenging. the open-ended nature of medicare fee for service lends itself to unpredictable swings in financial performance. mid-performance changes that impact how those targets are calculated make the task even more difficult.\n risk adjustment cms has proposed to modify the risk adjustment methodology to account for changes in case mix and severity of assigned beneficiaries. changes in risk score growth would be capped at +/-3% over the life of the contract.\n we are grateful that cms is reviewing the issue of risk adjustment. beneficiaries with higher risk scores can reasonably be expected to require more care and services, making it likely that their costs will exceed those of beneficiaries with more average risk scores. financial benchmarks should acknowledge this likelihood when data is available.\n 3 the cleveland clinic foundation 9500 euclid avenue / na4 cleveland, ohio 44195 tel 216 445-7445 fax 216 444-2436 morrisk@ccf.org\n denies the availability of information that provides an accurate picture. we urge cms to remove this cap. as a point of reference, we encourage cms to look at the process used to set rates in medicare advantage, in which risk score growth is not capped in a given year.\n national trend factor cms proposes to use both a regional and national trend factor, with greater weight to the national trend factor when an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s penetration in a market is higher. cms attributes the latter policy to concern about acos receiving credit for gains that do not reflect strong performance.\n we oppose the proposal to apply greater weight to the national trend factor solely based on market penetration. an assessment of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effectiveness should not be tied to the size of market penetration; cms should be able to set a financial target in a market that determines whether or not an aco was effective in generating savings, rather than creating a moving target based on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s individual circumstances.\n regional trend factor cms proposes to incorporate regional factors into the process of setting financial benchmarks for an aco. in so doing, cms will create a regional comparison group that includes both beneficiaries assigned to an aco and those that are not.\n we believe the purpose of tracking regional trends should be to assess whether or not the medicare shared savings program is generating savings for the medicare program when compared to medicare beneficiaries not impacted by the program. to that end, we encourage cms to remove beneficiaries assigned to an aco from the regional comparison group.\n\n program rules\n telehealth cms is proposing to extend waivers from medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s originating site requirements for telehealth services to acos taking on downside risk, including those in track 1+, effective 2020. this proposal is consistent with a statutory mandate in the chronic care act passed earlier this year.\n in april, cleveland clinic and three other acos participating in medicare shared savings program track 1+ wrote to administrator verma, asking that track 1+ be included in the flexibilities prescribed by the chronic care act; for the effective date to be expedited to 2019; and for the waiver to cover a broad range of services.\n we are pleased that cms will extend waivers from originating site requirements to acos participating in track 1+. this inclusion was consistent with the federal statute.\n we renew our request that cms make the telehealth waivers available to track 1+ acos beginning in 2019. while the statute for the chronic care act specified a 2020 date, cms has the authority to make this flexibility available earlier using the authority of the center for medicare and medicaid innovation.\n 4 the cleveland clinic foundation 9500 euclid avenue / na4 cleveland, ohio 44195 tel 216 445-7445 fax 216 444-2436 morrisk@ccf.org\n availability of prospective assignment cms proposed to make prospective assignment available to all acos, consistent with congressional direction in the chronic care act. we applaud this policy.\n hybrid assignment approach cms sought comments on a proposed hybrid assignment approach. under the hybrid approach, beneficiaries would have the ability to make an affirmative determination to opt in to an aco, or would be assigned if registering seven or more claims with providers in a given aco.\n we have great concern about the hybrid approach. while we support the ability of beneficiaries to make an affirmative selection, we believe the seven-claim threshold is high enough to fundamentally change the medicare shared savings program. the vast majority of potentially attributable aco beneficiaries are not high-risk and, therefore, may never need seven primary care service visits in a given period of time. additionally, organizations like ours have initiatives aimed at giving beneficiaries alternative types of visits that are not necessarily traditional primary care services, like pharmacy consultations and shared medical appointments. the potentially avoidable unintended consequence is a dramatic drop in attribution to the point that acos across the country will put into place infrastructure to better care for the patients they serve but never have those patients ultimately attributed to them.\n our aco currently includes over 100,000 medicare beneficiaries. the odds of even a simple majority of those beneficiaries making an affirmative selection or making seven clinical visits in a year is unlikely. this policy would likely gut our aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned population.\n an aco should be judged not just on how it manages those beneficiaries with chronic needs, but how it manages those beneficiaries who are

20201\n re: cms\u00e2\u0080\u00931701-p submitted electronically to: http://www.regulations.gov\n dear administrator verma:\n summa health writes today to respectfully comment on the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations: pathways to success (cms\u00e2\u0080\u00931701\u00e2\u0080\u0093p).\n at summa health, we actively embrace value-based care models.  we are sponsors and leaders of newhealth collaborative (nhc), a highly successful track 1 mssp aco in terms of both savings achieved and consistently high quality scores (90th percentile and above) since we launched nhc in 2012. our health plan, summacare,  a 4.5 star medicare advantage (ma) plan, is a payer partner and summa health medical group physicians are participating providers in the oncology care model (ocm \u00e2\u0080\u0093 track 1); and we have summacare as a payer partner and 14 summa health medical group primary care practices in the comprehensive primary care plus (cpc+) program, track 2. we are located in one of the 34 msas selected as a continuation of the mandatory cjr model experiment. most recently, summa has signed on to participate in 20 bpci advanced bundles (19 inpatient and 1 outpatient). we are committed to the quadrupleaim, working to improve the total health of the communities we serve by engaging in activities that result in better care, smarter spending, healthier patients and more satisfied providers and caregivers.\n\n 2\n we are members of premier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population health management collaborative, and support the comments they have developed in collaboration with their health system partners.  from our vantage point as an integrated delivery system actively tackling the challenge of shifting from volume to value, we offer the following targeted comments on the proposed rule that evolves the medicare shared savings program (mssp):\n recommendation 1: do not create a 6-month performance year for acos in current mssp models that expire december 31, 2018. instead, allow acos to extend their current agreements for one year, resulting in a january 1, 2020 start date under a new pathways to success model.  alternatively, if cms remains committed to a july 1, 2019 start date for this program upon rule finalization, entities that face a december 31, 2018 expiration date of their current model should be allowed to extend their current agreement until june 30, 2019, and then begin an 18-month first performance year under the new agreement. for all aco entities, but particularly those facing the 6- month extension situation, we ask cms reduce complexity by creating a singular assignment window and methodology across all acos for calendar year 2019.  finally, related to quality payment program (qpp) performance in cy 2019; if in an aapm for the 6-month period of july 1-december 31, deem the aco to meet the first prong of the aapm test for the entire year, and allow use of entire cy 2019 data in calculating qp thresholds.\n\n 3\n into the new model.  finally, given the interconnected nature of mssp to the qpp, it is similarly crucial that cms policy development not inadvertently deter acos like ours from transitioning to risk in 2019.  if cms choses to extend current model agreements for one year before entering the new model, summa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nhc would continue on as a mips-apm for the 2019 qpp evaluation year.  if cms finalizes a policy requiring a july 1, 2019 start date, relative to qpp, we respectfully ask that cms consider those aco entities that take risk in tracks that meet the aapm standard to be considered in the aapm for the entire calendar year for purposes of computing the qp thresholds.\n recommendation 2: create tiered glidepath from level e into enhanced track for high revenue acos.\n rationale: after the first 5-year period in the basic track ends, we strongly recommend that cms either tier the enhanced track to offer an additional step-wise formula to increasing the risk/reward exposure to providers (akin to the different levels within basic); or create a bridge between basic and enhanced.  a bridge program or tiered enhanced structure would allow providers to move forward in their risk-taking for a portion of the 5-years in the second agreement period. further, we request cms encourage providers participating in making this transition by setting the shared savings rate at 80 percent, and increase the maximum shared savings and losses rate over the agreement period.\n recommendation 3: clarify the interaction between bpci advanced and the pathways to success models as soon as possible.\n rationale: as an entity that recently committed to 20 bpci advanced bundles beginning oct 1, we respectfully request that cms clarify the interaction between bpci advanced and the pathways to success tracks as soon as possible.  for example, the proposed enhanced track shares characteristics of the mssp track 3 which in its current state cancels any bpci advanced episodes attributed to track 3 participants. we are committed to staying the course for the full 5 years of bpci advanced, but under the proposed rule would see pronounced changes when moving to the enhanced track. given the financial and operational investment we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve recently made in bpci advanced, including our partnership with remedy, providers need to understand explicitly how cms intends to handle the interaction of the two programs as we make our business decisions regarding the optimal pathways to success program for the next agreement period.\n recommendation 4: remove the proposed cap on beneficiary risk score growth.\n\n 4\n the trend in risk score growth among medicare fee-for-service (ffs)beneficiaries over the 5-year period from 2013-2017 is greater than 3 percent.  we instead encourage cms to develop a formulaic means of adjusting for risk score growth that is reflective of what trends in the ffs population demonstrate.  cms could look to leverage the ma risk score computation and process for the aco program.\n if we can provide further detail or specification on our above mentioned priorities, please contact derrick hall, system director, bundled payment at hallder@summahealth.org, 234-312-5270, or mairin mancino, system director,

the biotechnology innovation organization (bio) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099) medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success proposed rule (proposed rule).1\n bio is the world's largest trade association representing biotechnology companies, academic institutions, state biotechnology centers and related organizations across the united states and in more than 30 other nations. bio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s members develop medical products and technologies to treat patients afflicted with serious diseases, to delay the onset of these diseases, or to prevent them in the first place. in that way, our members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 novel therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics not only have improved health outcomes, but also have reduced healthcare expenditures due to fewer physician office visits, hospitalizations, and surgical interventions. bio membership includes biologics and vaccine manufacturers and developers who have worked closely with stakeholders across the spectrum, including the public health and advocacy communities, to support policies that help ensure access to innovative and life-saving medicines and vaccines for all individuals.\n cms is proposing changes to the medicare shared savings program (shared savings program) for accountable care organizations (acos) based on the following principles: (1) accountability: increasing savings for the medicare trust funds, mitigating losses by accelerating the move to two-sided risk by acos, and ensuring rigorous benchmarking; (2) competition: promoting free-market principles by encouraging the development of physician-only and rural acos in order to provide a pathway for physicians to stay independent, thereby preserving beneficiary choice; (3) engagement: promoting regulatory flexibility to allow acos to innovate and be successful in coordinating care, improving quality, and engaging with and incentivizing beneficiaries to achieve and maintain good health; (4) integrity: reducing opportunities for gaming; and (5) quality: improving quality of care for patients with an emphasis on promoting interoperability and the sharing of\n page 2 of 5\n healthcare data between providers, focusing on meaningful quality measures and combatting opioid addiction.\n bio represents an industry that is devoted to discovering new treatments and ensuring patient access to them. accordingly, we closely monitor changes to coverage and delivery of healthcare services for their potential impact on innovation and patient access to drugs and biologicals. we appreciate that the agency continues to evaluate the shared savings program and participating acos and to make updates that streamline operations, reduce burden, and promote a competitive and accountable marketplace, while ensuring that care quality and delivery is improved for medicare beneficiaries.\n in setting forward this pathway to success for acos operating through the shared savings program, bio believes it is critical for cms to ensure that: (1) patient access to innovative therapies and technologies is not hindered when delivered by providers participating in acos; (2) use of beneficiary incentives does not negatively impact patient care in acos; (3) appropriate quality measures for evaluation of delivery of care through acos; and (4) patients are able to access appropriate treatment for pain and addiction, including new innovations, in the context of acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to address the opioid crisis. we discuss each of these areas further below.\n (1) ensure patient access to innovative therapies and technologies in acos through adequate reimbursement and care coordination activities: while care coordination delivered through acos plays a central role in providing treatment to patients with chronic diseases or high health care needs, we note that risk-based models can create financial incentives to provide inadequate care. this is particularly true for new innovations in treatment, where the savings associated with these advances through other avoided healthcare interventions may not be realized within the relevant window of time, or accurately reflected in benchmarks used.\n given the continued drive toward more personalized medicine and treatment options, it is critical that cms consider opportunities to ensure patient access to innovations that may represent the most appropriate course of care for their given condition. to this end, bio urges cms to consider how to both provide adequate payments for delivery of treatment innovations by acos and monitor patient access to these innovations in the aco setting. cms should carve-out the costs of new innovations in treatment, such as through mechanisms that exist in other medicare payment programs for new treatments (i.e. new technology add-on payments, pass-through). additionally, these new innovations should also be carved-out from shared savings or other calculations where aco providers may be negatively impacted by providing higher cost innovations in treatment. further, the agency should require acos to address how they intend to ensure beneficiary access to new treatments and technologies as a part of the application process. cms should monitor use of treatment innovations accordingly to ensure that financial incentives do not create a barrier to novel treatment options.\n page 3 of 5\n manner that ensures patients receive timely access to the most appropriate form of treatment for their given condition. efforts to increase beneficiary adherence are critical to improving patient health outcomes and reducing overall healthcare expenditures. we appreciate the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection of feedback on this effort, and urge cms to move forward in a manner that allows for these arrangements, while ensuring provision of treatment is not negatively impacted through these care coordination activities.\n (2) ensure use of beneficiary incentives does not negatively impact patient care in acos: in the proposed rule, cms clarifies that they believe the regulations provide acos a considerable amount of flexibility to offer beneficiary incentives to encourage patient engagement, promote care coordination, and achieve shared savings program objectives. bio supports efforts to increase patient engagement and encourage beneficiary participation in their healthcare, however, we have concerns where such incentives may negatively impact the care delivered to patients through acos.\n cms notes a number of potential acceptable incentives for advancing clinical goals and discusses the use of incentive payments under these programs. these incentives include: vouchers for over-the-counter medications, wellness program memberships, disease management program vouchers, vouchers for meal programs, transportation services, and calendars or web-based applications for medication adherence management. while several of these items, including transportation and meal support services, represent critical associated services for advancing patient health, bio expresses caution where incentives may supplant, or delay, the most appropriate form of care and treatment. for instance, vouchers for over-the-counter medications should not be intended to reduce or replace access to appropriate prescription medicines. further, care coordination programs should not be used in lieu of appointments with appropriate specialty and ancillary care providers. finally, incentive payments should not serve as an inducement for patients to forgo certain types of care or treatment. we encourage cms to incorporate patient safeguards and monitor the use of these incentives in acos to ensure patient care and treatment, and subsequent health outcomes, are not negatively impacted.\n (3) ensure use of appropriate quality measures for delivery of care through acos: in the proposed rule, cms is seeking comments on approaches to developing the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality measure set in response to the meaningful measures initiative. bio believes that under the shared savings program risk-based model, the use of robust, evidence-based quality measures is critical to help determine how the program is impacting the use of appropriate care. the quality measures used should be outcomes-focused, working to capture the long-term impacts of interventions. further, quality measures that sufficiently target both general practitioners and specialty care providers should be selected and implemented. we believe there are a number of critical areas in which cms should bolster quality measures for use in the shared savings program, including better evaluation of care for common chronic diseases.\n page 4 of 5\n assurance (ncqa) released its healthcare effectiveness data and information set (hedis) measures for 2019, which includes a new composite adult immunization measure. bio supports the development, endorsement, and cms adoption of this composite adult immunization measure, which includes influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, for the shared savings program and across other settings.\n further, we urge cms to consider updates and inclusion of measures that are sufficiently targeted at the delivery of specialty care. by including measures in the shared savings program that address the complexity of care provided by specialty physicians, the agency can help ensure that patients are receiving the highest standard of care for their given health condition. existing quality measures that are benchmarked on a relatively \u00e2\u0080\u009chealthy\u00e2\u0080\u009d population can unduly penalize specialty physicians for caring for some of the sickest patients. we ask cms to continue to work with stakeholders and measure stewards, such as the ncqa and the national quality forum (nqf) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is a national, consensus-based measure-endorsing organization - to develop and endorse measures that appropriately reflect the range of healthcare needs for beneficiaries served through acos.\n (4) ensure access to appropriate treatment for pain and addiction, including new innovations, through acos efforts to address the opioid crisis: in this proposed rule, cms seeks feedback on considerations related to supporting acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 activities to address the national opioid crisis through data sharing and quality measures. we commend cms for its efforts to address the opioid crisis in aco and other healthcare delivery settings. bio is committed to being a partner in developing solutions to the opioid crisis. to that end, more than 30 of our member companies have come together to form a working group and identify priorities for how the biotechnology industry can help mitigate the crisis, focused under three key pillars: (1) advancing the understanding of the biology of pain and addiction to enable the development of innovative treatments for pain and addiction, and ensuring appropriate and optimal use of existing therapies; (2) ensuring that patients suffering from pain or addiction are able to receive the right treatment at the right time with the right support, without stigma; and (3) stimulating research and development of innovative treatments that effectively treat pain and opioid addiction and prevent abuse.\n in working to mitigate opioid misuse through this data sharing and potential follow-on efforts, bio encourages cms to ensure that any policy action aimed at reducing the number of opioid prescriptions includes adequate exemptions for chronic disease patients for whom opioids serve as the most appropriate form of treatment for their pain. further, quality measures should be directed at meeting patient need for pain management and substance use disorder (sud) treatment. cms should adopt quality measures for use in evaluating acos that better capture patient experience related to pain and pain management, while ensuring that such measures do not hinder either new treatment development or access.\n additionally, we ask cms to take steps beyond data sharing and quality measures that can help advance access to innovations in treatment for pain and addiction, which serve a critical role in addressing the opioid crisis. for example, the agency should consider further actions to provide separate payment for advances in pain treatment that reduce or mitigate addiction potential, such as was proposed in the ambulatory surgical setting for 2019. for acos who may be engaged in sud treatment, cms should provide adequate payment for delivery of the full range of medication-assisted treatments and associated care.\n page 5 of 5\n * * *\n bio appreciates the opportunity to comment on the medicare shared savings program

building 200 independence avenue, sw washington, dc 20201\n re: medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094 pathways to success (cms-1701-p)\n dear administrator verma:\n the next generation accountable care organization (aco) coalition writes to provide comments on the medicare shared savings program (mssp) proposed rule.  the coalition represents 33 participants in the next generation aco program who are committed to the future of two-sided risk models to create value in medicare and improve patient care and outcomes.  while many organizations across the country continue to plan and prepare to move into higher levels of risk, our members are at the forefront of meaningful delivery system reform.  the next gen acos are already successfully taking financial and clinical accountability for their patient populations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 generally across multiple lines of business such as ma, commercial risk, medicaid risk, programs for duals and of course medicare aco risk - with significant results in better care for their patients and savings for the federal government.\n the next gen aco participants have already shown that performance-based risk can transform care delivery.  a recent report by norc at the university of chicago for the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) highlighted the next gen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s widespread use of care management, chronic disease management and clinical programs, as well as an enhanced focus on primary care.  in addition, the administration touted $61 million in savings in the first year of the program across 18 model participants.  the next gen program has tremendous potential to continue to build on its early achievements, and we believe that other organizations can learn from this experience and also succeed in two- sided risk models.\n consistent with our commitment to the success of risk-bearing programs in traditional medicare, we provide the below guiding principles for your consideration as you finalize the mssp program rules.\n\n\n\n\nwww.nextgenaco.com \n 1) continue to incentivize the move to higher levels of risk. we are encouraged to see that through this rule, the administration is advancing opportunities in two-sided risk acos through this proposed rule.  we have seen firsthand the type of care transformation that is possible when organizations participate in performance-based risk to improve population health.  we are also pleased with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to waiving and modifying burdensome program rules for organizations that are engaged in increasing levels of financial risk.  examples in this rule include the beneficiary incentive program, telehealth wavier and the skilled nursing facility three-day stay waiver, all of which will apply to certain organizations engaged in two-sided financial models.  this flexibility will be key to encouraging the move to performance-based risk.\n however, we believe that more can be done to facilitate the transition.  as you finalize this rule and consider additional models in the future, we encourage the agency to work with organizations engaged in two-sided risk models across medicare (hmo & ppo), medicaid and commercial populations to identify other regulatory barriers that can be removed to further encourage the transition to higher levels of accountability.  we believe that greater program flexibility should be available to organizations taking on higher levels of risk \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that additional incentives should be created that are available to organizations at higher levels of risk than for those at lower levels of risk.\n 2) create consistency across programs. we respectfully request that cms continue to identify areas within the rules where the agency can create consistency across different medicare aco programs and even more broadly across the delivery system reform portfolio, including in medicare advantage. there may be some areas of program differentiation that remain important, such as differences that incentivize higher levels of risk-taking.  however, we note that there remain a number of areas from beneficiary attribution to payment methodology that differ substantially across the different programs. this is an issue for organizations advancing risk across multiple payment models and looking for greater predictability, transparency and simplicity.   we would welcome the opportunity to work with the agency to identify and evaluate where these programs differ and where harmonizing rules could benefit providers, patients and payers.\n\nwww.nextgenaco.com \n methodology and we would welcome the opportunity to work to develop an approach that incorporates lessons learned from mssp and the medicare advantage program.\n 4) create permanence for the next gen program. as cms considers and further develops the glide path to risk, we recommend that the agency create a voluntary, permanent aco option that incorporates the features of the ngaco model.  the next gen program participants have shown success with higher levels of two-sided risk and have made investments to bring delivery system changes to their local communities.  permanence would bring greater stability and predictability to our efforts.  in addition, a permanent model could serve to provide additional direction and goals for providers entering the mssp today.  we also note that a voluntary, permanent next gen-like offering could provide an opportunity to reduce administrative burden for next gens by streamlining program requirements.\n in conclusion, we appreciate your commitment to performance-based risk and creating a glide path for organizations to move to higher levels of risk. our organizations have seen the success of these models and we look forward to continuing to work with cms to advance better care for patients, providers and payers across traditional medicare. please do not hesitate to contact mara mcdermott (mara@nextgencoalition.org) if you have any questions about these comments.\n\n sincerely,\n\n\n\n mara mcdermott\n\n\n\n",

verma:\n the medicare rights center (medicare rights) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the on the proposed changes to medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations--pathways to success. medicare rights is a national, nonprofit organization that works to ensure access to affordable health care for older adults and people with disabilities through counseling and advocacy, educational programs, and public policy initiatives. medicare rights provides services and resources to three million people with medicare, family caregivers, and professionals each year.\n the comments that follow are informed by our experience assisting people as they navigate the medicare program. we discuss the importance of including the beneficiary perspective in efforts to create a patient-centered health care system that promotes value and that preserves and bolsters the consumer protections that are at the heart of the medicare program.\n we appreciate the work the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) is doing to streamline and modernize the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and to ensure its long- term success. while it is clear that the current program needs to be improved, we continue to support its underlying goal of increasing value and beneficiary well-being in the health system.\n streamlining participation options and limiting one-sided risk\n 2 different timelines, and all would push accountable care organizations (acos) up in risk automatically. most notably, they would shorten the time acos could spend participating via one-sided risk. currently, one-sided risk through track 1 is available for up to six years. in the reformulation, the basic track levels a and b would allow acos to participate with one-sided risk for two years (plus six months for acos that participate starting july 1, 2019). after that, acos would be automatically promoted to levels that include two-sided risk.\n recent data seem to show that acos are helping to stem cost increases in medicare. for example, cms estimates that in 2017, 472 mssp acos caring for nine million beneficiaries generated gross savings of $1.1 billion and netted $314 million in savings to the medicare trust fund.1 recent peer-reviewed studies by harvard university researchers have found that the mssp slightly increased medicare spending in 2013 but saved $286.9 million in 2014, even after accounting for shared savings bonuses earned by acos.2\n these data indicate that shared savings contracts without downside risk may be a fiscally viable alternative payment model for medicare. but in the proposed rule, cms suggests that some acos\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically acos that do not accept two-sided risk\u00e2\u0080\u0094have increased medicare spending. this appears to be a miscalculation. unfortunately, many of the proposals in the nprm have as their underlying rationale an assertion that acos with one-sided risk are not saving the medicare program money. if this rationale is in error, many of the proposed changes become less urgent or even counterproductive. if track 1\u00e2\u0080\u0094one-sided risk\u00e2\u0080\u0094acos save medicare dollars, changes that may drive these acos from participation are unwise.\n this makes it extremely important to understand the risks and advantages of altering aco risk options. because the data do not appear to agree with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rationale, we are concerned that this proposal would curtail the promise and possibilities of the mssp program by limiting participation unnecessarily.\n cms argues that acos in two-sided models perform better over time than one-sided model acos. this may be true, but this correlation does not necessarily mean that the move to two- sided risk was the cause of the improved performance. we would predict that acos that expect to be successful at managing risk would be more likely to accept risk. that their self-assessment is accurate should not come as a complete surprise.\n cms also notes that track 1 acos are reluctant to move to two-sided risk. we cannot know if such acos have good reason for their reluctance and would choose to abandon the mssp rather than accept untenable risk. a national association of acos (naacos) survey showed that\n71.4% of acos indicated they would likely leave the mssp if they were forced to assume risk.3 \n while some of these acos are likely either overstating their reluctance or could be persuaded\n 1 centers for medicare & medicaid

spur acos to more quickly accept risk, it may be that the change from six to two years is too abrupt. we encourage cms to thoroughly investigate its options before committing to a change that may endanger participation in the mssp.\n determining participation options based on medicare fee-for-service (ffs) revenue and prior participation\n cms proposes to adopt policies that would more strictly police gaming within the mssp. we support robust oversight of all medicare options and believe cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in predicting and curtailing gaming in new value-based models is essential. we encourage cms to explore the ways bad actors may use current or new structures to take advantage of programmatic rules or beneficiaries.6 ultimately, people with medicare suffer when loopholes and poor incentives are permitted.\n this new oversight would be increasingly necessary if cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals to change how acos are treated based on their revenue are adopted. in the nprm, cms proposes that low-revenue acos have more flexibility to avoid risk than high-revenue acos and suggests that high- revenue acos have greater ability to control spending than low-revenue acos. this bifurcation of the mssp could be counterproductive if the high-revenue acos either reform their ownership to count as low-revenue acos or, worse, if they avoid the mssp program entirely, thus denying medicare the potential savings. entities that have the greatest potential for savings should arguably be given more incentive to participate, not less.\n ffs benefit enhancements\n skilled nursing facility (snf) waiver\n currently, eligible track 3 acos can apply for a waiver of the three-day inpatient hospitalization requirement before a snf admission for prospectively assigned beneficiaries. cms proposes to extend this waiver to all acos that participate in two-sided risk. if the\n 4 restructuring of the tracks takes place as proposed, this would include both the basic track (levels c, d, and e) and the enhanced track. further, cms proposes to allow this waiver for acos using prospective assignment or preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation, and to allow critical access hospitals or rural hospitals with swing-bed arrangements to be eligible partners for waiver purposes.\n the requirement for a qualifying hospital stay of three consecutive days as an admitted inpatient prior to a covered snf stay was included in the original medicare legislation7 to \u00e2\u0080\u009chelp limit the payment of the extended care benefits to persons for whom such care may reasonably be presumed to be required in connection with continued treatment following hospital inpatient care\u00e2\u0080\u009d while at the same time making \u00e2\u0080\u009cless likely unduly long hospital stays.\u00e2\u0080\u009d8 but progress in medicine since that date has permitted shorter hospital stays in general, without eliminating the ongoing need for follow-up snf care to ensure the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety and well-being.\n in addition, many beneficiaries go to the hospital and remain there for several days without ever being admitted as inpatients. this type of stay, usually called an \u00e2\u0080\u009cobservation stay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d often looks exactly like an inpatient admission from the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective. importantly, if patients are never admitted as inpatients, even if they spend over three days in the hospital, they will not be eligible for medicare coverage of a subsequent snf stay. and they do not have the ability to formally appeal their classification as outpatients. this means that if they are transferred to a snf, they will be responsible for the entire cost of their care.9\n [i]n 2012, medicare beneficiaries had more than 600,000 hospital stays that were at least three days long but would not have qualified the beneficiary for snf services because the patient was classified as an outpatient for some or all of the stay. more than 25,000 of the beneficiaries in these 600,000 hospital stays were discharged to an snf following their hospital stays even though they did not qualify for medicare part a snf coverage. because the three-day inpatient stay requirement was not met, such beneficiaries could have been liable for substantial costs related to bed and board, drugs/biologicals, durable medical equipment, and nursing care received during their snf stays.10\n the use of observation stays is increasing as a result of multiple factors, including but not limited to:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 medicare payment policy changes and increased reporting;\n 7 the social security amendments of 1965, pub.l. 89\u00e2\u0080\u009397.\n8 u.s. congress, house committee on ways and means, report of the committee on ways and means on h.r. \n 6675, 89th cong., 1st sess., march 1965, no. 213 (washington: gpo, 1965), p. 27. 9 medicare interactive, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedicare and observation services\u00e2\u0080\u009d (last visited october 16, 2018), https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-covered-services/outpatient-hospital-services/medicare- and-observation-services. 10 scott r. talaga, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skilled nursing facility (snf) three-day inpatient stay requirement: in brief,\u00e2\u0080\u009d congressional research service (june 2, 2016), available at https://www.ahcancal.org/advocacy/solutions/documents/congressional%20research%20services%20report%20o n%20three-day%20stay%20requirement.pdf.\n 5 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increased scrutiny by both public and private payers of short inpatient stays; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 efficiency advantages for hospitals of observation stays over inpatient admission; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 incentives to reduce hospital admissions. as of march 8, 2017, hospitals are required to provide patients with a medicare outpatient observation notice (moon) if they are being kept in observation status rather than admitted as inpatients. but the notice is simply informational; there is no formal medicare appeal process through which a beneficiary can challenge their outpatient status.\n both the three-day requirement and the observation stay exclusion\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the financial incentives that underlie these policies\u00e2\u0080\u0094can usurp the provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in determining what care is medically necessary and in the best interest of the patient. providers must provide safe and adequate care and discharge planning for people with medicare, and hospitals are not permitted to discharge a patient if there is no such safe discharge plan. a snf will not generally accept a private pay patient who does not have the resources to guarantee payment, so this is a quandary for patients and providers when the patient needs snf care but cannot afford to private pay.\n in a worst-case scenario, beneficiaries may self-discharge against medical advice and return home before they are physically or mentally ready, and potentially suffer further devastating and expensive acute health effects. barring this, the patient may end up staying in the hospital past the time they would otherwise have been transferred into less costly care options, or seek alternative care that is covered by medicare, but that might not be the most appropriate setting for their needs.\n for these reasons, we support an extension of aco ability to transfer patients to snfs without the otherwise required three-day inpatient stay. allowing acos to ensure beneficiaries can access and afford needed care is critical if the model is to be truly patient-centered.\n telehealth\n cms proposes that since acos with prospective beneficiary assignment would have the opportunity to provide telehealth services, beneficiaries who are prospectively assigned at the start of the year, but are subsequently excluded from assignment, should be protected by a 90- day grace period. as proposed, this means cms would waive the originating site requirement and pay for otherwise covered telehealth services furnished to a qualifying beneficiary during the grace period.  further, cms proposes that if the aco provides otherwise-eligible telehealth services to a beneficiary who is not prospectively assigned, the aco participant must not charge the beneficiary for the expenses; must return any money already collected; and may be subject to compliance actions including a corrective action plan. we support these vital protections. because of the nature of acos beneficiaries are not positioned to know where they are prospectively assigned, if at all, or to understand and abide by the mssp rules. the aco entities must be responsible for these charges and hold the beneficiaries harmless.\n providing tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n 6\n as required by the bipartisan budget act of 2018, acos participating in two-sided risk (including basic track acos in levels c, d, or e and enhanced track acos if the proposed streamlining of options occurs) would be allowed to apply to establish a cms- approved beneficiary incentive program to provide incentive payments to eligible beneficiaries for qualifying services. cms seeks comments on whether an aco that offers a beneficiary incentive program should be required to notify cms of any modifications prior to its implementation. we support such notification. beneficiary incentive programs are potential sources of inappropriate steering and gaming and must be closely monitored to ensure that beneficiary interests are protected. because much of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activities are behind the scenes, cms must take care that mssp participants are not given free rein to influence or attempt to influence beneficiary choice and assignment.\n cms proposes to prohibit cash incentives as they are more difficult to track. cms also proposes that acos maintain records including the identity of patient and provider, amount of incentive, date of service, and date of payment. we support this proposal as well as the proposal that these records must be made available.\n cms also seeks comment on when or if it would be appropriate for an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficiary incentive program to be terminated by the secretary. a termination option should be available for instances when an aco is using the program to steer or influence beneficiaries improperly, or if the aco fails to maintain or make available records, or otherwise fails to meet the requirements of the program. as abruptly ending these programs could have negative implications for participating beneficiaries, we encourage cms to clearly establish standards with which acos must comply in order to operate beneficiary incentive programs. termination should be a last resort, and beneficiaries as well as the public should have advance notice and the opportunity to comment for the record. cms must ensure that beneficiary access to care is not jeopardized by a termination.\n cms proposes to prohibit advertisement of a beneficiary incentive program. we agree. this is too fraught with risk that beneficiaries could be steered toward the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s providers and services, directly or indirectly. cms asks, however, what should be done to make beneficiaries aware of the program and whether cms should supply template language on the topic. because we support cms template language for sensitive issues within value-based models that are particularly prone to steering or other inappropriate behavior, we strongly support this proposal.11 in addition, we urge cms to conduct beneficiary testing and share draft language with stakeholders to ensure the template truly conveys the existence of such a program in neutral ways that are easily understandable and not misleading or otherwise inappropriate.\n cms also proposes to require public reporting of the total number of beneficiaries, the total number of incentive payments, codes for such payments, the total value of all incentive payments, and the total type of each payment. we support this reporting. public reporting enables interested beneficiaries to find more information and also allows researchers and\n 7 advocates to investigate the use of such programs. we encourage cms to take necessary measures to protect beneficiary information and privacy.\n beneficiary notifications\n cms proposes to require additional content for beneficiary notifications and that beneficiaries receive such notices at the first primary care visit of each performance year. the notifications currently inform beneficiaries that their providers are participating in the mssp, that they have the opportunity to decline claims data sharing, and that they have the ability to change identification of a primary care provider for purposes of voluntary alignment. cms proposes further to require aco participants to use a template notice from cms that would provide details regarding a step-by-step process for voluntary alignment. we support these changes. as discussed above, sensitive issues within value-based models that are particularly prone to steering are ideal for cms templates, especially those that have been consumer tested for clarity and effectiveness.\n cms also seeks comment on whether the template notice should include other information outlining aco activities that may be related to or affect a medicare ffs beneficiary, including aco quality reporting and improvement activities; aco financial incentives to lower growth in expenditures; aco care redesign processes (such as use of care coordinators); the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of payment rule waivers (such as the snf 3-day rule waiver); and the availability of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficiary incentive program. we support including this information as it would strengthen consumer awareness and confidence in the program.\n cms seeks feedback on the format, content, and frequency of this additional notice. as noted throughout, we urge cms to do consumer testing on all notices to ensure the information is conveyed accurately and objectively and in a manner the beneficiary can use.\n beneficiary \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cms notes that some stakeholders support allowing a beneficiary to \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d to assignment in a specific aco. absent this option, its proponents claim, a beneficiary has little or no incentive or requirement to cooperate with the aco. to this end, cms seeks comments on whether to create an alternative beneficiary assignment methodology under which a beneficiary would be assigned to an aco if the beneficiary has \u00e2\u0080\u009copted-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d to assignment to the aco. the rationale that an opt- in is preferable because beneficiaries lack incentives or requirements suggests that the stakeholders in question believe the opt in would provide such incentive or requirement. we are deeply opposed to such an approach, which would seemingly transform acos from a freely chosen model into a clone of medicare advantage (ma). indeed, cms notes that opting in could be similar to enrolling in an ma plan, with the potential for election periods. (of course, ma has no tools by which to \u00e2\u0080\u009crequire\u00e2\u0080\u009d beneficiaries to cooperate, so this language is additionally troubling.) cms notes the potential for great confusion with this option and makes clear that \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeneficiaries opting-in to assignment to an aco would still retain the freedom to choose to receive care from any medicare-enrolled provider or supplier, including providers and suppliers outside the aco.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n 8 this discussion makes it extremely difficult to understand the incentive (or indeed the \u00e2\u0080\u009crequirement\u00e2\u0080\u009d) potential of the opt-in process. what are beneficiaries gaining, or standing to lose, by opting in? how does opting in change their relationship with the aco? how does opting in differ from voluntary assignment from the beneficiary perspective? we oppose any proposal that would increase the burden on beneficiaries, lock them into any arrangements with providers, or otherwise curtail their access to care. fee-for-service medicare allows freedom of provider choice by definition.\n cms notes that any opt-in process would require safeguards similar to those placed on the ma program, including marketing guidelines and requirements to prevent cherry picking or discrimination. we agree that ma has such safeguards, and note they are needed, in part, because ma is a limit on choice. we object to any efforts to allow acos to mimic ma limits on choice. until the parameters of any tradeoffs beneficiaries would be making by opting in are perfectly clear, we cannot suggest what safeguards must be in place.\n conclusion\n thank you for your consideration. we look forward to working together to advance policies that consider and balance the needs of all stakeholders while promoting high-value and high-quality care. for additional information, please contact lindsey copeland, federal policy director at lcopeland@medicarerights.org or

health systems to help them finance, operate and manage their value-based businesses. we work in financially and operationally aligned partnerships with risk-based accountable care organizations (acos) and provider-sponsored health plans (pshps) in medicare, medicaid and commercial populations. founded in 2011, evolent is proud to count more than 40 provider and payer organizations as aligned partners, jointly managing more than three million patients under value-based arrangements. this includes over 10 health plans and 14 medicare or medicaid acos with more than 4,000 physicians and other clinicians participating in value-based arrangements in which evolent is operationally and financially aligned with our partners. supporting independent provider organizations is an increasing focus of our business. evolent also owns and operates its own health plan division, called true health, which currently serves the commercial market and is soon to expand into the medicare advantage program.\n evolent is strongly aligned with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 guiding principles of driving value in health care, offering financial and clinical accountability to providers, and empowering consumers with the choice and transparency needed to help improve their own care in close partnership with properly incentivized providers. the current medicare fee-for-service (ffs) system, as well as some current aco models, have not been designed to promote innovation in payment and care delivery. fully reorienting our health care system toward value will require cms to create additional opportunities for providers to assume full accountability across all populations. cms has taken bold and important steps in its medicare shared savings program (mssp) proposed rule to move acos in that direction. ultimately medicare beneficiaries should have \u00e2\u0080\u009cno wrong door\u00e2\u0080\u009d to access high-value health care, whether they enter two-sided risk acos or similar alternative payment models, or medicare advantage plans. over time, traditional fee-for-service medicare not tied to value should comprise a much smaller share of the program.\n\n response to the proposed rule\n\n redesigning participation options to facilitate transition to performance-based risk\n evolent supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s redesign of the medicare shared savings program to accelerate aco adoption of performance-based risk, including time-limiting the proposed basic track and requiring all mssp participants to accept two-sided risk by 2021. these changes will provide greater stability and predictability and will help more providers benefit from qualifying as advanced alternative payment models under medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality payment program. strong guideposts are critical to moving health care providers and organizations that may otherwise be risk-averse, even if they are capable of taking on greater risk with the proper incentives and support. cms has taken a thoughtful approach to ensuring a glide path for providers into risk, which factors in acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 revenue and experience.\n\n 800 n. glebe road  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  suite 500  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  arlington, virginia 22203  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  evolenthealth.com program through separate rulemaking under sec. 1115a authority, could offer the opportunity for provider organizations experienced in managing risk to accept 80 percent or 100 percent upside and downside risk, resulting in high-quality, coordinated care for beneficiaries and significant savings to the medicare trust fund. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first annual report on the next gen aco program showed significant savings to medicare \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a 1.1 percent reduction in medicare spending (more than $62 million net of shared savings payments) and improved utilization and quality of care across several domains for the 18 participants in performance-year one (2016).\n we believe that the characteristics of more fully accountable programs, such as medicare advantage and the ngaco model, provide a sustainable foundation for supporting financial accountability among providers. with a few specific design alterations, the core components of the ngaco model could serve as a chassis for future innovative programs such as the direct provider contracting (dpc) model. these design features should be consistent across all cms programs and include the following:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 high-value integrated provider networks that accept financial accountability \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 financial opportunity that is maximized through two-sided risk design \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 voluntary, inclusive participation for all practices with tailored support for smaller practices \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 open patient enrollment and freedom of choice for consumers \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 standardization of performance accelerators within programs\n\n mssp start date and duration\n cms has proposed a six-month extension for current mssp acos whose agreements expire at the end of 2018, along with a special one-time july 1, 2019 start date. current and prospective aco leaders are evaluating their options with respect to not only the mssp start date, but to participation in other potential models such as the dpc model anticipated to be released by cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innovation center (cmmi). we urge cms to take the whole payment model landscape into account and to take any measures necessary to maximize the level of certainty for providers and to incentivize participation in higher-risk models over lower-risk models. for example, participants in mssp or cmmi models should not be excluded from switching to dpc when it first comes online, regardless of where they are in their program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifecycle.\n evolent supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to extend participation agreements from three years to five years in duration, as acos tend to perform better the longer they remain in the program. further, under longer agreement periods, historical benchmarks would become more predictable, since the benchmark would continue to be based on the expenditures for beneficiaries who would have been assigned to the aco in the three most recent years prior to the start of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreement period.\n\n risk adjustment\n cms has proposed eliminating the distinction between new and continuously assigned beneficiaries for the purposes of risk adjustment. we support this change. applying risk adjustment uniformly to all assigned beneficiaries should improve payment accuracy and encourage acos to serve patients with more complex conditions.\n\n 800 n. glebe road  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  suite 500  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  arlington, virginia 22203  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  evolenthealth.com cms has also proposed a new risk adjustment methodology for mssp acos that allows \u00e2\u00b13 percent change in the benchmark to accommodate rising (or decreasing) hierarchical condition category (hcc) risk scores between the baseline year and the performance year. evolent believes this is a step in the right direction for mssp. however, our experience as an operating partner for 10 next gen acos has taught us that the \u00e2\u00b13 percent range is insufficient, which would especially be the case over the course of a five-year agreement period. we are concerned that many mssp acos will exceed the 3 percent cap organically (i.e. not due to coding intensity but rather due to a true increase in beneficiary acuity), which would be an unfair and artificial hindrance to these organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to be successful in the program. while we acknowledge and appreciate the risk adjustment projections that cms has performed (as described on page 361 of the proposed rule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original publication), we have learned from our own experiences in the ngaco model that it is extremely difficult to forecast risk scores, especially over multiple years. furthermore, the 30 percent projection still constitutes a large number of acos that would be hamstrung by the risk score cap.\n reduction in risk scores through an annual coding adjustment alone should be sufficient to address cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concern about paying more due to increasing coding intensity. we believe that the best approach is for cms to remove any caps on maximum risk adjustment in mssp while still guarding against overpayment by leveraging a predictable, annual coding factor adjustment. for example, cms could preserve its ability, with advance regulatory notice to acos, to retroactively modify the projected coding factor if the final observed risk trend for the applicable performance years deviates significantly from the projected coding factor. this approach is currently used in the ngaco program. it is our opinion that a prospectively set coding factor adjustment is preferable to the proposed renormalization approach because the coding factor approach addresses the same issue as renormalization while allowing mssp acos a higher degree of predictability in their financial forecasting.\n however, if such a cap-free model is operationally or financially infeasible, an alternative risk adjustment approach would be to raise the hcc risk adjustment cap to 5 percent while leveraging the aforementioned coding factor adjustment policy in place of renormalization. a 5 percent cap in risk scores (instead of the proposed 3 percent cap) will allow those acos that experience true increases in beneficiary acuity in excess of 3 percent the opportunity to operate under a benchmark target that is reflective of their beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 acuity. we are unfamiliar with the details behind the risk adjustment projections described in the mssp proposed rule (page 361 in the original publication); we do not know the average projected increase in hcc scores over the five- year period, nor do we know the standard deviation. however, if only 30 percent of acos are projected to have a true increase in acuity above the proposed 3 percent cap, raising the 3 percent cap to a 5 percent cap should not be overly financially averse to cms.\n\n benchmark methodology\n\n 800 n. glebe road  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  suite 500  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  arlington, virginia 22203  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  evolenthealth.com example, only one or two health systems serve large shares of beneficiaries for their region, cms should consider allowing for a higher national component to provide a more even playing field.\n\n beneficiary alignment approaches\n evolent supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow for choice between prospective or retrospective assignment for mssp acos. cms is also exploring additional ways to engage beneficiaries. these include an opt-in-based assignment methodology in which beneficiaries would elect to join an aco rather than simply designating a primary clinician, as under the current voluntary alignment process. evolent is pleased to see this increased focus on patient choice. however, it will be critical to ensure that any voluntary opt-in approaches \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether in mssp or in the forthcoming dpc model \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can be combined with attribution for acos to achieve sufficient scale. using solely beneficiary opt-in approaches would be a drastic change for acos and would require significant resources and technical assistance for success.\n in keeping this proposal one of several alignment options available to mssp acos, cms could add incentives aimed at increasing take-up of the new option and broader beneficiary engagement. for example, for those acos that choose the opt-in methodology (with or without secondary alignment), cms could provide an interest-free loan with a longer payback period, a benchmark bump of 0.5 percent or 0.75 percent or other flexibility related to benchmarks to support the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needed investments in training, outreach and enrollment efforts.\n\n expansion of waiver availability within mssp\n evolent supports the proposed expansion of waiver availability within mssp, which has benefitted next gen acos. as a principle, cms should also consider how to use waivers, and perhaps waive or modify other rules, as incentives for taking on higher levels of risk for patient outcomes and cost. further, we urge cms to add additional patient engagement tools for acos, such as allowing them to develop networks of preferred providers and to offer discounts and other incentives to patients using them. this approach could be especially helpful in engaging specialist providers in the aco.\n\n ensuring continued success of smaller and physician-led acos in mssp\n evolent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partnership model has been deployed in a variety of local health care markets throughout the united states and has generated several lessons for us and the provider organizations that we help transition to a value-based care delivery model. for example, the provision of good quality, timely data is crucial. our aco partners have also found tremendous value in evolent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk-sharing approach (i.e., sharing in upside and downside risk, akin to reinsurance mechanisms used in commercial insurance). cms should continue to allow these types of mechanisms, which ensure that all partners have \u00e2\u0080\u009cskin in the game\u00e2\u0080\u009d and strong incentives to succeed for patients and the medicare program.\n\n 800 n. glebe road  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  suite 500  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  arlington, virginia 22203  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  evolenthealth.com spectrum, to move closer to accepting total financial accountability for a cohort of patients. once financial accountability and aligned incentives are evident throughout the health care system in a meaningful way, provider and consumer

supported efforts to redesign how care is delivered, especially in terms supporting access to family medicine and primary care services. our members recognize the importance of value-based care as evidenced by the 40 percent of our members participating in acos or advanced apms. acofp members have firsthand experience of the reality of implementing value-based arrangements, including acos, and consistently highlight that acos and other apms do not sufficiently value the delivery of primary care services and are administratively burdensome for solo, small, and rural area primary care practices.\nacofp previously has shared with the agency the value of primary care, which is well-documented. studies have shown that increased access to primary care is more likely to result in preventive services and treatment for medical conditions before they become chronic and costly to treat.\u0002 a. b. bindman, k. grumbach, d. osmond et al., \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary care receipt of

non-visit based care management fees, which averaged $17.50 per beneficiary per month. the cpc model resulted in some positive outcomes, including reduced emergency department utilization, fewer hospitalizations, and improved patient satisfaction. further, medicare expenditures grew more slowly for cpc participants than for the comparison group.\u0002 see, evaluation of the comprehensive primary care initiative: fourth annual report available at \u0013 hyperlink

\u0014https://www.mathematica-mpr.com/our-publications-and-findings/publications/evaluation-of-the-comprehensive-primary-care-initiative-fourth-annual-report\u0015. \r we recognize that there were minimal savings associated with cpc, but highlight that the value of family medicine is in the long-term prevention of chronic conditions and for population health-related measures, which was not taken into account in the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evaluation. specifically, the management of chronic diseases and ensuring patients have continued access to preventive services is critical to containing long-term cost growth, which was not reflected sufficiently in cpc.\n\u0002 see, evaluation of the comprehensive primary care initiative: fourth annual report available at \u0013 hyperlink

patient-centered primary care collaborative (pcpcc) released a report\u0002 y. jabbarpour, m. coffman, a. habib et al., \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvanced primary care: a key contributor to successful acos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d august 2018. available at \u0013 hyperlink \"https://www.pcpcc.org/sites/default/files/resources/pcpcc%202018%20evidence%20report.pdf\" \u0014https://www.pcpcc.org/sites/default/files/resources/pcpcc%202018%20evidence%20report.pdf\u0015. \r highlighting that a strong foundation of advanced primary care, as embodied in the patient centered medical home (pcmh), is critical to the success of care delivery reforms. the pcpcc found that acos with a higher proportion of pcmh primary care physicians were more likely to generate savings and demonstrated higher quality scores on both process and outcome measures. specifically, pcpcc concludes that acos with a primary care orientation show that: (1) costs generally decreased; and (2) quality outcomes improved. while overall health care utilization results varied, acofp believes that utilization related to primary care services is a better use of health care services so long as more expensive, downstream services are avoided while quality outcomes remain the same or improve. while more research is needed, the pcpcc ultimately recommended that policymakers consider the value of advanced primary care.\n\u0002 y. jabbarpour, m. coffman, a. habib et al., \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvanced primary care: a key contributor to successful acos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d august 2018.

increased access to primary care services, especially as they relate to the success of acos and potential for cost savings and increased quality. we urge cms to consider these findings and consider ways to increase access to primary care through acos.\nproposed changes to the mssp and acos\nacofp believes that mssp and aco participation is a significant and effective tool to transition our health care delivery system from one that incentivizes the volume of services delivered to the value of those services. despite their well-documented success, there still remain significant barriers that prevent primary care physicians \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially those in solo, small, or rural area practices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from meaningfully participating in acos. specifically, establishing and participating in acos requires a significant upfront investment that is not accounted for in the calculation or availability of shared savings. such an investment is untenable for solo, small, and rural area primary care practices that operate on continually diminishing margins. these practices do not have the financial reserves or employee bandwidth to adopt and implement changes to successfully participate in an aco.\nopportunities\nin light of the existing challenges acofp members face in meaningfully participating in acos, we appreciate the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to redesign the mssp. in this proposed rule, cms appropriately identifies and proposes key changes that will improve our ability to aid in the transformation of our health care delivery system. specifically, we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to increase stability and predictability by extending the aco agreement period from three to five years. historically, a three year agreement period has been insufficient in terms of enabling participants to implement reforms to care delivery and workflow. a five-year agreement period is critical to ensuring that aco participants see the benefits of their investment and effort.\nacofp also appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 steps to implement statutory changes to the mssp established by the bipartisan budget act of 2018 (bba) and the 21st century cures act. specifically, the added regulatory flexibility regarding beneficiary assignment options, expanded use of telehealth, and enabling the provision of beneficiary incentives through a cash equivalent are all efforts that we support. while we recognize that this flexibility is limited by statutory requirements, we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to provide flexibility within its authority.\nbarriers and challenges\nacofp is concerned that several of the changes in this proposed rule will exacerbate existing barriers and add challenges to meaningful aco participation by primary care physicians. as previously noted, there are many existing challenges, some of which the agency seeks to address through this proposed rule. however, challenges remain, including the key deterrents that prevent solo, small, and rural primary care practices from participating in the mssp. in addition to the upfront costs, the prospect of taking on any risk is especially challenging for these types of practices. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposals to move acos more quickly to mandatory risk-sharing arrangements as well as the reduced shared saving rates make aco participation more challenging. imposing more risk and at an earlier stage will place primary care physicians that are new to risk-based sharing arrangements at a significant disadvantage, and they likely will be left behind in the transition to value-based care.\nfurther, while cms has proposed alternative beneficiary assignment methodologies, the uncertainty involved with aco participation as well as the significant data lag continue to pose significant barriers. the opportunity to implement, adapt, refine, and improve care redesign efforts is significantly restricted by the drastic annual increases in financial liability. while we appreciate the flexibility cms offers for aco participants to move up to higher risk levels under the basic track, we urge similar flexibility for aco participants to elect to remain in the prior year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk level. this could be capped to a certain number of performance periods, but would at least provide some protection for participants who may need more time and flexibility to adjust to increasing financial requirements.\nas previously stated, we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to implement the statutory changes in the bba. while we understand that the bba limited the availability of these flexibilities to participants in risk-sharing acos, we believe it is within cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 authority to lessen the restrictions and remove certain barriers to participation in risk-sharing arrangements. specifically, we urge cms to reconsider its proposals related to the minimum loss rate (mlr) and minimum saving rate (msr). as physicians look to future aco years, the prospect of limited upside with increasing downside will continue to force smaller practices to remain in the merit-based incentive payment system, thus derailing the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement toward value-based care.\nfurther, the reduced shared savings rates for low-risk models and restrictive early termination policies will continue to exclude key aco participants \u00e2\u0080\u0093 primary care physicians. this exclusion will mostly impact primary care physicians, like our members, meaning the availability of the additional regulatory flexibility \u00e2\u0080\u0093 much of which is tied to the delivery of primary care services \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will not have the intended impact.\nrecommendations\noverall, we urge cms to consider and ensure primary care physicians in all settings have an opportunity to meaningfully participate in acos or other apms. acofp believes this will be critical to further improving the quality of care medicare beneficiaries receive while reducing their costs and costs to the medicare program.\nbased on our outlined concerns and the described value of primary care services, we offer several important recommendations that we believe will advance primary care provider participation in acos help to drive the transition to value-based care arrangements. specifically, we urge cms to:\nuse its authority to create alternative pathways, including adjusting mlrs and msrs, to sufficiently recognize that not all physicians and practices are similarly situated;\nadjust its proposed mandatory risk and risk increases so that certain qualified aco participants (e.g., solo, small, and rural area practices, low-revenue practices) would not be subject to these requirements;\nprovide additional flexibility for certain qualified aco participants such that they can elect to remain at a certain level of risk-sharing;\nallow aco participants to terminate without any associated penalties or future restrictions upon demonstrating certain hardships; and\nremove the risk ratio cap as this would reduce benchmark accuracy in future years, potentially resulting in \u00e2\u0080\u009ccherry-picking\u00e2\u0080\u009d medicare beneficiaries and reducing access to care.\n\n\n", "0418": "see attached.\n\n\n\n 20 f street, nw, suite 200

payment policies and rates under the ipps for fiscal year (fy) 2019\n dear administrator verma:\n the national business group on health (nbgh or the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbusiness group\u00e2\u0080\u009d) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the center for medicare and medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s) pathways to success proposal to overhaul the medicare shared savings program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s) accountable care organizations (acos).\n the business group represents 429 primarily large employers, including 74 of the fortune 100, who voluntarily provide group health and other employee benefits to over 55 million american employees, retirees, and their families. advancing better and more efficient health care delivery and payment policies is increasingly critical as rising costs affect the ability of beneficiaries, governments, insurers, and employers to afford care.\n below, we offer background on our interest in this topic and expand upon the business group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recommendations on specific elements of the proposal.\n background: the role of acos, from the employer perspective\n for many employers, widespread growth in consumer-directed health plans (cdhp), a demand-side tool, has led them to turn to the supply-side of health care, to consider ways to control costs while continuing to deliver high quality care to their employers. with fewer plan design levers available in a cdhp environment, employers are looking at acos, as well as other alternative payment and delivery models, as a promise of potentially higher-quality, lower-cost and more consumer-focused health care. employers have had to temper expectations about the speed and magnitude of savings from acos, as perhaps, the administration has had to, given that much upfront investment in capabilities, training, and process changes, is required for acos to succeed in the longer-term.\n national  business  group  on  health\u00e2\u00ae\n\n\n 2 to navigate the challenges associated with assessing the value of new ways to organize and deliver care, the business group has undertaken a focused effort to help employers assess the potential of acos. through our executive committee on value purchasing, committee members have developed a toolkit to provide employers with a road map on implementing an aco strategy from assessing market opportunity, understanding aco readiness, considering plan design options, improving employee engagement and evaluating aco performance.\n on their own and aided by this work, 21% of large employers actively promoted acos in 2018 and another 35% percent of employers are setting up acos and high-performance networks (hpns) either by directly contracting with health care providers or by working through their health plans in 2019.1\n we urge cms to consider the work carried out by our members, as a resource, as it moves forward with its work on the mssp, as there are synergies in objectives within both the public and commercial markets.  the mssp creates incentives for acos to improve care by allowing them to share savings they generate by achieving defined quality and cost goals. the program allows acos to gradually take on financial risk for managing spending growth. such an approach gives acos time to build the infrastructure\u00e2\u0080\u0094the care coordination, information technology, and data analytics capabilities\u00e2\u0080\u0094to transform practice and manage risk successfully.\n thus, while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to promote value-based transformation and to push industry momentum forward, that promotion must be tempered with balance to not unduly create barriers to entry in transitioning to value-based care.  further, while direct savings generated by acos to medicare may be modest, there is evidence that the mssp generates substantial indirect savings due to the spillover effect of delivery system changes on fee-for-service medicare spending.2\n accelerating the requirement to take on downside financial risk\n in general, we are supportive of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to ramp up the acceptance of downside financial risk in the aco environment.  however, we have concerns that the speed of the proposed transition could have the effect of slowing the aco movement.  given the reported savings of the mssp of approximately $1.8 billion between 2013-2015, we believe it is important to continue fostering the growth of the program.3\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to simplify the track structure by retiring the current mssp tracks 1, 1+, 2 and 3, replacing those existing mssp tracks with new basic and enhanced tracks effective july 1, 2019, with the basic track containing levels a through e.\n our concern lies in the speed of the transition to a reduced shared savings rate.  the current shared savings rate for track 1 is 50 percent, which would be reduced to 25 percent under the proposed basic track levels a and b. although the shared savings rates and shared loss rates gradually increase across the levels until they reach those in level e, which has the same shared savings and loss rates as the\n national  business  group  on  health\u00e2\u00ae\n\n\n 3 current track 1+, the shared loss rates remain constant at 30 percent across levels c, d and e, and the amount of maximum losses gradually increases.\n we are concerned that while cms estimates that these proposed changes would save medicare $2.24 billion across the next 10 years, over the same timeframe, the changes would cause 109 of 561 participating acos to exit the program.  the projected withdrawal of acos is due in large part to the perceived unattractiveness of the new savings rate and risk sharing arrangement.  we urge cms to consider a more gradual transition to encourage more acos to stay in the program, given the savings that even downside-only acos have generated to the program to date \u00e2\u0080\u0093 according to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own estimates, one-sided mssp track 1 acos generated more 2017 savings per beneficiary than those bearing risk under mssp tracks 2 and 3.4\n high revenue and low revenue aco designations\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to create a new distinction that evaluates the percent of the aco participant parts a and b ffs revenue compared to aco benchmarks to categorize acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009clow revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos.  this distinction will help create clear guidelines for when an aco must move to risk. we also support the removal of a self-reporting mechanism for determining high revenue or low revenue acos, and instead using medicare claims data to make this determination. this approach would provide a more accurate method for determining an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preparedness to take on additional risk rather than an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-reported information regarding the composition of its aco participants and any ownership and operational interests in those aco participants.\n incorporating provider feedback\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to incorporate new flexibilities that have been requested by providers, including:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 allowing acos to select and even change their desired beneficiary attribution methodology on an annual basis\u00e2\u0080\u0094and allowing participants in upside-only models to select prospective attribution; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 informing beneficiaries of their aco participation; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 allowing annual risk adjustment to aco benchmarks (i.e., during an agreement period); \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 reimbursing for telehealth services for prospectively assigned beneficiaries in non-rural areas; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 allowing broader access to the snf 3-day waiver; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 accelerating the incorporation of regional adjustments into the program's benchmarking methodology.\n we are encouraged by the nod to the role telehealth plays in delivering high-quality and high-value care to consumers.  as the technology continues to advance, more providers and health care systems are incorporating various aspects of telehealth into health care delivery. there is growing evidence about the benefits that the utilization of telehealth can have in both reducing costs for health care and increasing access to specialty and routine health care services. as employers grapple with creative and innovative approaches to addressing health and wellness in the workplace, many employers are considering adding telehealth to the line-up of health benefits provided to employees.\n national  business  group  on  health\u00e2\u00ae\n\n\n 4\n a mere seven years ago, telehealth was an innovation just being introduced to consumers.  developed by new entrants to the health care marketplace, it was the first sign that virtual care could offer consumers greater convenience and efficiency of care. since then, the rate of adoption of telehealth has been extraordinary. in 2012, 14% of large employers offered telehealth as an alternative pathway to accessing health care for select services. today, nearly every large employer offers telehealth for minor non-urgent services, making telehealth available to employees in states where it is allowed.5\n increasing beneficiary engagement\n we strongly support requiring all acos to provide written notification to patients about their participation in the aco, what that entails, and how the model will impact care. additionally, we support allowing certain acos under performance-based risk models to offer incentive payments to patients in return for participation in the aco, if those acos offering incentives are part of a two-sided risk model.\n currently, 10.5 million medicare beneficiaries are in an mssp aco. however, these patients may not know they are receiving care as a part of an aco, or what an aco is.  we agree with cms that these steps will increase transparency, allow patients to make decisions about where to receive their care, and strengthen beneficiary engagement.\n continue technical assistance\n as acos continue to evolve in maturity, we urge cms to continue to provide technical assistance to help them better understand risk adjustment and benchmark methodology.  a hallmark of the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success relies on the ability of an aco to understand how risk scores may affect their financial performance and.  we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ongoing efforts to provide this technical assistance and urge cms to continue these efforts through providing beneficiary-level risk score information in quarterly and annual reports, as well as by providing detailed explanations of the risk adjustment calculations to acos through webinars and other educational opportunities.  further, to the extent possible, we encourage cms to consider streamlining the risk adjustment methodology.  combined, these efforts could have the impact of making it easier and more efficient for acos to continue to participate in the mssp.\n promotion of interoperability\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desire to encourage certified electronic health record technology (cehrt) use by acos, to better align with the goals of the quality payment program (qpp) by requiring that all acos demonstrate a specified level of cehrt use for participation. we also support placing a stronger emphasis on measures that require the exchange of health information between providers and patients.\n a recent report found that, given the myriad of ehr systems, 36 percent of medical record administrators struggle with the exchange of patient health records:6\n national  business  group  on  health\u00e2\u00ae\n\n\n 5\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 24 percent of administrators were unable to use meaningful patient data they received electronically from outside sources not within a siloed ehr system. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 85 percent of network physicians believed the task of interoperability between healthcare providers lay with their core ehrs, rather than themselves, to initiate the sharing of information to improve population health, precision medicine and value-based payment models. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 62 percent of hospitals were not utilizing patient information from outside their ehr system, because outside data is not available in their systems\u00e2\u0080\u0099 workflow. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 72 percent of medical administrators reported the incoming patient information was not presented in a useful format, a 5 percent increase in 2017 compared to the previous year. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 30 percent of hospital-based physicians reported the data they viewed cannot be trusted when it was sent between different systems from outside providers. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 22 percent of hospital it managers reported considering ehr alternative vendors in 2019.\n efficient interoperability is essential to lower costs, improved health outcomes and patient satisfaction.\n opioid misuse strategy\n we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to align policies under the mssp with the overarching goals outlined by the opioid misuse strategy and to help acos and their participating providers and suppliers in responding to and managing opioid use.  specifically, we support:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 sharing aggregate medicare part d data with acos; and, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 adding measures specific to opioid use to the aco quality measures set.\n given the enormity of the opioid crisis, the potential benefits of such policies would be to focus acos on the appropriate use of opioids for their assigned beneficiaries and support their opioid misuse prevention efforts.\n according to a recent survey, employers are increasingly focused on understanding the opioid epidemic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact on the workplace. this focus has spotlighted for employers that inappropriate use/abuse of prescription opioids expands beyond increased costs or employee absenteeism. employers have reported overdoses by employees or their family members, sometimes resulting in long-term health consequences. further, some (12%) employers experienced the death of employees or their family members. increased awareness and understanding of the epidemic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact on the workplace has naturally increased concern among employers. eighty-two percent of large employers are concerned/very concerned about this issue.7\n thank you for considering our comments and recommendations regarding the proposed aco policy changes. we look forward to reading the comments to the docket and following

humphrey building 200 independence avenue sw washington, dc 20201 submitted electronically via www.regulations.gov\n re: medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success (cms-1701-p)\n dear administrator verma:\n on behalf of ascension, i appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed rule entitled medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success1.\n ascension is a faith-based healthcare organization dedicated to transformation through innovation across the continuum of care. as the largest non-profit health system in the u.s. and the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest catholic health system, ascension is committed to delivering compassionate, personalized care to all, with special attention to persons living in poverty and those most vulnerable. in fy2018, ascension provided nearly $2 billion in care of persons living in poverty and other community benefit programs.  ascension  includes  approximately  156,000  associates  and  34,000  aligned  providers. ascension\u00e2\u0080\u0099s healthcare division operates more than 2,600 sites of care \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including 151 hospitals and more than 50 senior living facilities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in 21 states and the district of columbia, while its solutions division  provides  a  variety  of  services  and  solutions  including  physician  practice  management, venture capital investing, investment management, biomedical engineering, facilities management, clinical  care  management,  information  services,  risk  management,  and  contracting  through ascension\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own group purchasing organization.\n ascension currently operates or participates in more than a dozen medicare shared savings program (mssp) accountable care organizations (acos), serving more than 260,000 medicare beneficiaries nationwide. in  performance  year  2017,  ascension  acos  achieved  approximately  $84  million  in savings  through  the  mssp. in  light  of  this  experience,  and  our  shared  goal  of  expanding  the availability  of  high-performing  acos  nationwide,  we  offer  the  following  comments  and recommendations for cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consideration.\n\n\n page 2 of 5\n\n\n\ni. support for benefits afforded to two-sided risk models \n\n ascension believes the proposed rule includes several themes and provisions that will play a key role in reducing total cost of care, improving patient centered care, and increasing quality. we know cms is well-aware that administrative costs for acos are significant. quality improvement staff, data and analytics, information  technology systems,  care  managers, and  care  coordinators  are  common investments made  by  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to achieve  success  in  the  program. considering  the  significant investments being made by all mssp acos, regardless of the track or level they might qualify for under  the  proposed  rule,  we  support  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  proposal  to  make the  following  benefits available  to basic track acos at levels c and beyond: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 waiver of the skilled nursing facility (snf) three-day rule; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 waiver of the telehealth services originating site and geographic requirements; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 enhanced beneficiary engagement tools.\n\nii. permitting annual participation elections \n\n ascension supports the proposal to permit annual election of beneficiary assignment methodology, as  it  will  provide  acos  the  flexibility  to  innovate  their  care  coordination  efforts,  increasing  the likelihood they develop a cost-effective care coordination model that results in shared savings.\n prospective  and  retrospective  assignment  methodologies  have  unique  features  that  impact  the delivery of care management services. for example, prospective attribution allows for more strategic and cost-efficient outreach activities than retrospective attribution because the aco has knowledge up  front  of  the  members  they  are  responsible  for  managing. conversely,  retrospective  attribution helps ensure that the final expenditure amount used in the shared savings calculation reflects patients that in fact received a plurality of primary care from a provider participating in the aco during the performance year. affording acos the flexibility to choose between assignment methodologies will allow for enhancements to care delivery and population management that result from prior learnings. however,  we  echo  concerns  raised  by  the  track  3  collaborative  in  their  comment  letter  and encourage cms to use a singular assignment window and methodology to determine the assigned population for the entire calendar year 2019.\n\niii. benchmarking methodology refinements \n\n\na. risk  adjustment  methodology for  adjusting  historical  benchmark  each \n performance year\n we agree with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries. we also support the proposal to apply a symmetrical cap to changes in risk scores over the course of the agreement period. the current distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries makes it difficult for acos to predict how their financial performance may be affected by risk adjustment and does not allow benchmarks to vary with changes in health status that are not attributable to coding initiatives.\n page 3 of 5\n\n\n we believe an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk ratio cap should be increased incrementally for each performance year. for example, the risk ratio cap in the first performance year could be established at one percent and could increase annually through performance year five (topping out at five percent). this approach would better reflect the likelihood that the relative morbidity of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries will change. in  addition,  this  approach  would  better  address  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  concerns  regarding  upcoding  initiatives because the risk ratio cap in early performance years would be less than the risk ratio cap in later performance years.\n alternatively, we urge cms to reconsider the five-year contract period proposed in section ii.a.2 of the  proposed  rule. we are  concerned  that the  length  of  the  contract  term  in  relation  to  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed  risk  ratio  cap  is too  long to  properly  reflect  changes  in  the attributes  of  the assigned beneficiary population.\n regardless of the approach finalized, we strongly urge cms to provide acos with the data used by the agency to develop benchmarks. providing stakeholders with this data would allow them to replicate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s methodology and improve their understanding of their own benchmark. the lack of clarity into the benchmark is a serious financial risk that, for many acos, may deter against continued participation in the program.\n in addition, we urge cms to provide detailed information regarding the expenditures associated with patients  involved  in  more  than  one alternative  payment  model  (apm). without  the  transparency afforded by receiving such data, it is difficult\u00e2\u0080\u0094if not impossible\u00e2\u0080\u0094for acos to understand the financial impact of these overlapping programs. in addition, the lack of complete expenditure data gives the impression that cms may not apply their patient overlap policies consistently, undermining efforts of apm  participants  to  coordinate  and  enter into risk-sharing  arrangements. we  believe  such  risk- sharing  arrangements  would  improve  overall  financial  performance  for  apm  participants  by eliminating waste in care management efforts stemming from multiple parties attempting to manage the same patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care.\n\nb. use of regional factors when establishing and resetting acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benchmarks \n\n we  appreciate  cms considering changes to  the  benchmark methodology that  will  more  fully recognize both the acuity of the attributed population and regional efficiency. many low cost, efficient providers have struggled to produce results below aggressive benchmarks and this proposal should provide significant relief, particularly for new entrants. however, the proposal to limit the full positive regional  trend  adjustment from  70  percent  to  50  percent  seems  to  limit  the  potential for  low  cost systems relative to their peers. the proposal also imposes an arbitrary cap of 5% of the average expenditures by enrollment type. we encourage cms to reconsider the cap proposal. in addition, we encourage  cms  to  apply  a  70  percent  regional  trend  adjustment,  consistent  with  prior  cms regulations.\n\niv. fee-for-service (ffs) benefit enhancements: shared savings program snf 3-day \n rule waiver\n page 4 of 5\n\n\n the retrospective assignment methodology. the proposed rule effectively opens up the waiver to the majority of the ffs medicare panel for mssps with retrospective assignment, while keeping the rules in  place  for  mssps  selecting  prospective  assignment  methodologies. we  encourage  cms  to consider providing the  same opportunity to  mssps operating  under  prospective  assignment methodologies.\n\nv. empowering beneficiary choice: beneficiary notifications  \n\n under the proposed rule, cms would require aco participants to notify beneficiaries about aco participation and voluntary alignment, among other information, at the point of care. specifically, the aco participant would be newly required to notify the beneficiary of his or her ability to, and the process  by  which,  he or  she  may  identify  or  change identification  of  a  primary  care  provider for purposes of voluntary alignment. cms also proposes to require that aco participants provide this information to each medicare ffs beneficiary at the first primary care visit of each performance year. this requirement would be in addition to the existing requirement that aco participants post signage with  relevant  information in  participating  sites and,  in  some  instances,  make  written notification available upon request. while we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to reduce burden by creating a template notice for acos to use, we remain concerned that this proposed requirement will still lead to significant additional administrative burden for participants and we encourage cms to reconsider this provision.\n\nvi. advance notice for and payment consequences of termination  \n\n ascension supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to reduce the notice of termination requirement from 60 to 30 days. however, we encourage cms to reconsider disallowing acos that voluntarily terminate after june 30 (but before december 31) an opportunity to share in a portion of any shared saving earned. the proposed approach would apply a pro-rated adjustment only to losses. while cms believes that acos expecting to generate savings are less likely to terminate early in the first place, there may be scenarios that force early termination. acos that generate savings to the program should not be penalized for making such decisions, given the investments made to participate and generate savings to the medicare program.\n\nvii. proposals for phase-in of performance-based risk in the basic track \n\n ascension supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow track 1 acos to enter the basic track at the b, c, d, or e level. we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flexibility regarding the varied tolerance for risk that individual track 1 acos may currently possess.\n however, ascension  encourages  cms  to  retain  quality  scores  in  the  shared  loss  methodology calculation as part of the basic track. improved quality for medicare beneficiaries has always been a cornerstone of the program and should continue to be a vital part of both shared savings and shared loss calculations. we also encourage cms to reconsider the shared savings rate proposed for the basic track levels a through d. as noted above, acos must make significant upfront investments to realize success in the mssp and we believe a minimum 50 percent sharing rate would be equitable to the requisite investments made.\n page 5 of 5\n\n\n viii. determining  participation  options  based  on  medicare  ffs  revenue  and  prior participation\n cms proposes to distinguish among acos based on their degree of control over total medicare parts a  and  b  ffs expenditures  for  their  assigned beneficiaries  by  identifying  low  revenue and high revenue acos. we believe differentiating high and low revenue acos will lead to acos excluding acute  facilities  from  participation  over  the  long-term.  we  firmly  believe  transformation can  only successfully occur when there is coordination across the continuum of care and we encourage cms to reconsider this proposed policy.\n conclusion\n ascension

services 7500 security boulevard c1-13-07 baltimore, md 21244\n re: cms-1701-p \u00e2\u0080\u0093 medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations- pathways to success\n dear administrator verma:\n the national community pharmacists association (ncpa) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the center  for medicare  and  medicaid  services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) proposed  rule titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedicare  program;  medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which was published in the federal register on august 17, 2018.1 ncpa represents america\u00e2\u0080\u0099s community pharmacists, including 22,000 independent community pharmacies. together they represent an $76 billion healthcare marketplace and employ 250,000 individuals on a full- or part-time basis. our members are small business owners who are among america\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most accessible healthcare providers.\n the  medicare  shared  savings  program  (mssp)  incentivized medicare  accountable  care  organizations (medicare acos) to improve provider quality by sharing in the savings generated by a coordinated method of healthcare delivery. ncpa has consistently advocated that community pharmacists play an integral role in healthcare by encouraging preventative care and promoting wellness given community pharmacists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 subject matter expertise on medication use and access to patients in the communities in which they are located. as such, establishing options available under the medicare to encourage acos to utilize community pharmacies is an obvious and natural transition for complete coordinated care for medicare beneficiaries.\n in this proposed rule, ncpa appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to streamline the aco tracks to increase savings in the medicare  program  and  ncpa  supports  integrating  more  pharmacists,  as  either  provider/supplier  or contractor, into aco programs to contribute to those savings. community pharmacists, however, are still on the outside looking in at most aco programs. the utilization of medicare part d plans in aco programs as proposed in this proposed rule may present a possible avenue to promote the pharmacist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in medicare. the enclosed comments will focus on how medicare acos can work alongside stand-alone part d plans to encourage  the  coordination  of  care  with  community  pharmacies  for  medicare  ffs  beneficiaries.  these comments will also outline the difficulties that community pharmacies have found in the part d space and recommend solutions that will encourage the usage of community pharmacies in acos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni. program data and quality measures  \n\n ncpa supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 quest to align quality measurements and reporting requirements under the mssp with quality measurements and reporting requirements in other medicare programs. doing so would minimize the need for providers to devote excessive resources to understand and achieve the different measures. pharmacies  that  belong  to  a  clinically  integrated  network  are  capable  of  reporting and  helping  patients manage several of the data points that acos report such as immunization status, smoking status, body mass index (bmi), and hemoglobin a1c. community pharmacies are no stranger to quality measurements and reporting requirements, specifically in medicare part d. plan sponsor quality in part d is measured via a star rating system which is based on plan-level quality metrics. these measures were never intended to measure individual pharmacy quality.  however,  pharmacy  benefit  managers  (pbms),  the  entrenched  middleman between part d plan sponsors and pharmacies, utilize these plan-level metrics to dole out arbitrary and inconsistent quality measures on pharmacies within a plan/pbm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s network. put another way, the plan-level quality measures may have little to nothing to do with the services performed by pharmacists that contribute to a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health, but everything to do with making sure that a plan achieves a higher star rating in part\nd.  \n\n\nii. interoperability \n\n cms seeks  information  on  the  kinds of  clinical  and pharmacy dispensing data  that may  be  necessary to support improved coordination of care for medicare ffs beneficiaries. ncpa supports the sharing of clinical and pharmacy dispensing data that may be necessary to support improved medication use for medicare ffs beneficiaries and would highlight the pharmacy hit collaborative\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work to advance the pharmacist ecare plan to accomplish sharing of data amongst providers.2 in recent years, there has been momentum in the community  pharmacy  sector  away  from  proprietary documentation platforms  to  standards-based documentation using the pharmacist  ecare plan. this effort  uses  existing  standards  adopted  by medical providers  in  electronic  medical  records (hl7) to  develop  an  electronic pharmacist ecare plan,  which  is  a shared  document  detailing  a  patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  current  medication  regimen  and  health  concerns,  including  drug therapy  problems  and  medication  support  needs,  in  addition  to  the pharmacy's  interventions  and  the patient's  health  outcomes  over  time. other data  components  include patient  demographics,  payer information, health concern information (allergies and medication therapy problems), medication history, interventions,  care  coordination,  referral  information,  patient  centric  medication  related  goals,  and outcomes. right now, pharmacy partners are participating in the pharmacist ecare plan initiative in cpesn\u00e2\u00ae usa clinically integrated networks. cms should consider the pharmacist ecare plan as a standard way of sharing pharmacist-provided clinical data that will give pharmacists a way to validate their services for these new emerging quality-based payment models and move to new payment models in parallel with the same movement for physician groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niii. coordination of pharmacy care for aco beneficiaries  \n\n community pharmacies must be a critical component of any care team\n cms seeks information on how acos and part d sponsors could work together to improve medication use for medicare ffs beneficiaries to achieve better health outcomes. it is widely understood that the inclusion of pharmacists on care teams can have a significant impact on a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall care and outcomes. thus, the inclusion of part d sponsors in an aco program seems obvious because part d sponsors presumably have a robust network of pharmacies to offer to acos. however, not all part d sponsors and their pbms prioritize access to local community pharmacies in their part d preferred networks. instead, these networks are often limited  to  a  smaller  number  of  select  pharmacies (typically chain  pharmacies)  and regularly exclude community pharmacies even when such pharmacies are willing to accept the terms and conditions of a part d sponsor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  network. for  this  reason,  ncpa  is  concerned  that community  pharmacies may not  be  fully represented  in aco programs if  acos solely rely  on part d  sponsor pharmacy  networks to  coordinate pharmacy care for medicare ffs beneficiaries.\n currently, it is possible for community pharmacists to directly contract with acos. unlike many chain drug stores, community pharmacists provide access for medicare beneficiaries in rural and underserved areas and provide several services  that  bring  value  to  acos,  including medication  management  therapy  (mtm), medication reconciliation, and assistance with care transitions to manage medication use. thus, to bolster access to community pharmacies in acos, ncpa encourages cms to consider network adequacy standards for community pharmacies between acos and part d sponsors.\n in  the alternative,  ncpa  encourages  cms  to  consider integrating established  networks  of  community pharmacies into  medicare  acos to maintain  access  to  critical community pharmacies in  rural  and underserved areas. for example, outside of the medicare program ncpa members are already a part of a cpesn clinically  integrated  network  which coordinates  patient  care  with  physicians,  care  managers,  and other patient care teams to provide medication optimization activities and enhanced services for high-risk patients. cpesn  pharmacy  providers  see  their  complex  patients an  average  of 35  times  a  year,  while physicians  only  see  their patients  3.5  times  a  year.3 ncpa  member  pharmacies  in  these networks work directly with payers to add enhanced services into contracts and lower drug costs of care.4 as health plans continue to recognize that pharmacists can lower the overall spend for both the patient and plan, cpesn is an attractive option for an increased number of and scope of healthcare payers. cpesn now has 46 networks in  41 states  across  the  united  states.5 ncpa  supports the cpesn model as  a blueprint to incorporate community pharmacies into the aco model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n subject  to  certain guardrails, part  d mtm programs should be emphasized as  a  way  for community pharmacists to influence value-based care in acos in the part d space, pharmacists can engage in a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health outcome by participating in plan sponsor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mtm programs. mtm programs are offered to specific medicare beneficiaries to help improve a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medication use for chronic conditions. mtm programs typically involve an annual comprehensive medication review (cmr) as well as quarterly follow ups to encourage patients to stay on track. there is growing evidence that mtm services not only improve the quality of care beneficiaries receive but can also generate medical savings. thus, encouraging the usage of part d mtm programs in medicare acos is  an  avenue to  promote value-based  care.  however,  it must  be  noted  that there  are stark differences between part d mtm services and medication management services that are currently being offered by acos. for example, part d plans have vast discretion of who and why a beneficiary can be eligible for mtm and cases are only referred to community pharmacist providers rather than allowing pharmacists to initiate a case when appropriate. this means that a beneficiary in one plan who is eligible for mtm may not be eligible for  another plan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  mtm  program based  on  the  plan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  determination  on  the  types  of  chronic conditions or number of medications that will qualify a beneficiary for mtm services. it is for this reason, ncpa supports the application of guardrails that would encourage part d sponsors to uniformly apply mtm services to beneficiaries and promote robust access and utilization of such services. further, ncpa supports the expansion of the number of metrics related to mtm services and the inclusion of clinical and less process-based measures in rating part d plans. as the healthcare payment paradigm shifts from a volume- to value-based system, ncpa strongly encourages cms to reconsider the structure of the mtm benefit  to one  that rewards  for improved patient outcomes,  like current medication management services in acos that are based on medication monitoring across a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care team and are based on a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs. ncpa supports the usage of mtm in acos that incorporate community pharmacists into healthcare  teams to  improve  care  for  medicare  beneficiaries,  not  to  contribute  to  the  achievement  of process-based measures utilized to measure part d plans. financial arrangements should be based on achievable pharmacy quality metrics for patient services and should be payable to the very pharmacists that help obtain quality and cost goals\n finally, cms asks for information on ways to structure financial arrangements to reward acos and part d sponsors for improved health outcomes and lower growth in expenditures for medicare ffs beneficiaries. the core concept of acos is to encourage a team of providers to cooperate and save money for the medicare program.  most  importantly  (and  most  attractive  to  providers),  acos  who  achieve  certain  quality and medicare savings targets can keep a portion of those savings. community pharmacies can help acos obtain these quality and cost goals, but there are some notable problems within the part d space that may hinder a pharmacy from obtaining financial incentives for such help.\n\n\n\n\n performance metrics set by pbms to help plan sponsors achieve their plan-level measures. these quality metrics are applied retroactively and impact the overall reimbursement of the pharmacy in part d.\n pbms often state that the quality metrics that they utilize will reward higher performing pharmacies, but ncpa is not aware of any community pharmacy that has received a payment for achieving such metrics. put another  way,  these  quality metrics are  based  on  a  payment  methodology  that  does  not  reward  higher performing  pharmacies. rather  all  pharmacies  are punished, and  higher  performing  pharmacies  are  just punished less.  some plans withhold a certain dollar amount from part d claims with the opportunity for a small fraction of pharmacies to \u00e2\u0080\u009cearn back\u00e2\u0080\u009d what has been withheld but the incentive plan may be structured so that 80 percent of pharmacies are returned only pennies on each withheld dollar. as stated above, other plans simply structure their pharmacy performance plans by subtracting retroactive fees based on achieving certain arbitrary quality measures.\n ncpa remains vocal about the inconsistency of these quality metrics and has made numerous requests that cms define pharmacy quality within the medicare part d program to hold plans accountable for determining quality-based  payments.  payments  based  on  quality should  be standardized,  achievable,  and  proven to measure  pharmacy  performance,  as  opposed  to  criteria  that  focus  on  measuring  plan  performance and criteria that pharmacies have little or no opportunity to influence. most of all, quality metrics should be measured by the services that a pharmacist performs to contribute to the overall health of their patient. if these measures are used across aco and part d, the result would encourage better health outcomes for medicare beneficiaries and savings to the medicare program.\n more so, the whole point of acos is to provide payments to providers for the quality services that they deliver and contribute  to  savings  for  the  medicare  program.  however, because  pharmacists are  not  direct contractors with cms, it is unclear whether plan sponsors or pbms will pass quality payments to pharmacies for the savings that a pharmacist helped achieve for an aco. ncpa recommends that cms set up guardrails which would directly pass-through parts of the savings achieved by aco programs to community pharmacies. not doing so would unfairly enrich part d sponsors and pbms and punish the very pharmacists that helped achieve those goals.\n\niv. conclusion \n\n ncpa appreciates the opportunity to share with you ncpa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments and suggestions on this proposed rule.

(cms)\ndepartment of health and human services\n200 independence ave., sw\nwashington, dc 20201\nre: medicare program: medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success\ndear administrator verma,\nthe american academy of pas (aapa), on behalf of the more than 123,000 pas (physician assistants) throughout the united states, appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the accountable care organizations (acos) pathways to success proposed rule.\nacos are critical to the success of medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shared savings payment models and the efforts to lower costs while improving care coordination and continuity. pas are listed by medicare as one of three types of health professionals who deliver primary care services. however, only patients who have had at least one primary care service provided by a physician are eligible to be assigned or attributed to an aco. under the current aco policy, medicare beneficiaries treated solely by pas and nurse practitioners (nps) can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be assigned to an aco, except when care is delivered in certified rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers. this inability for beneficiary assignment with pa-/np-provided care is especially problematic for patients when a pa or np is the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary healthcare professional, which is increasingly common throughout the country. the problem of requiring a beneficiary to receive at least one visit from a physician exists under both methods of aco assignment: claims-based, in which assignment is determined by provider claims submitted to medicare, and voluntary, in which assignment occurs when a beneficiary proactively chooses a particular aco health professional, typically through an on-line process.\naapa has long advocated for a modification to the code of federal regulations (cfr)\u00e2\u00a7 425.402, to authorize beneficiary visits to pas and nps to trigger a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aco assignment.\ngiven additional flexibility by section 50331 of the 2018 bipartisan budget act, the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) proposes to modify language in cfr\u00e2\u00a7 425.402 pertaining to a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voluntary assignment to an aco. cms proposes to remove the requirement for a beneficiary to receive a primary care service from a physician in order to be assigned to an aco. if finalized, beneficiaries who receive all of their care from a pa would be able to be assigned to an aco if the beneficiary proactively selects a pa as their primary clinician. aapa supports the change allowing beneficiaries to select a pa as their aco clinician under one assignment methodology, as it recognizes the importance of respecting a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice of provider of care and acknowledges pas as capable of delivering the full range of care for a beneficiary, but an important barrier to full beneficiary choice in aco assignment remains.\naapa continues to have serious concerns regarding the aco assignment methodology. first, this new flexibility only exists under voluntary assignment. the alternative and less administratively burdensome method of beneficiary assignment to an aco, claims-based assignment, is not given similar flexibility. under claims-based assignment, a beneficiary still must first receive at least one primary care service from a physician to be eligible for assignment to an aco. while the bipartisan budget act of 2018 and cms both indicate voluntary identification by beneficiaries supersedes claims-based assignment, this is only the case if voluntary pa identification is elected. that is, beneficiaries are required to take the additional step of identifying and communicating to medicare the pa they wish to coordinate their care.\ncms, in its proposed rule, indicates the claims-based assignment methodology is the method by which the \u00e2\u0080\u009cvast majority of beneficiaries are assigned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d aapa requests cms make the necessary changes to allow patients to achieve aco assignment with care delivered only by a pa with the claims-made assignment process. if such authority does not exist, then, in the spirit of the flexibility proposed by cms in this rule, we request the agency work with congress to authorize beneficiaries who only receive care from a pa to be eligible for aco assignment under the claims-based assignment methodology.\naapa is further concerned with the suggestion in the proposed rule that beneficiaries utilize the cms physician compare website to find all medicare-enrolled health professionals and choose the provider they want as their primary clinician. aapa is not confident the physician compare website, as currently constituted, is accurate and completely inclusive of pas and other health professionals. aapa will work with cms officials and contractor staff of physician compare to ensure that pas are fully represented on the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s site and beneficiaries have accurate information when choosing who delivers their care.\nthank you for the

the health care delivery system through person- centered and market-driven approaches that empower beneficiaries as consumers and increase choices and competition to drive quality, reduce costs, and improve outcomes. we work each day to create a people-centered health system focused on delivering better health, better care, and lower costs in our communities. trinity health is committed to working with cms to promote innovative model designs and testing, including total cost of care risk models. today, approximately 25 percent or $8.5 billion of our business operates through total cost of care models, and we have set a goal of having 75 percent of our billings in value-based payment models. across our system, we serve 1.5 million patients under total cost of care contracts across all segments: medicare, medicaid and commercial risk. we are aligned with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal of encouraging participation in models with upside potential and downside risk \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the recommendations we offer below are intended to support these shared goals.\n we view the movement to value-based care and payment as essential to advancing high-quality care, improving outcomes for medicare beneficiaries and reducing costs for the program. this is particularly important given the 2018 medicare trustees report, which projects that the hospital insurance (hi) trust fund will be exhausted in 2026 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 three years earlier than the last report.1 we commend cms for implementing and evolving the medicare shared savings program (mssp), which is a critical component of the movement to value-based care across the industry. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 leadership has generated excitement and valuable learnings over the past five years.the industry has responded to the changes cms has led and we believe that we are much closer to having an accountable healthcare system today as a result.\n overall, we believe the accountable care organization (aco) model, as a delivery system, has effectively decreased costs and improved quality \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when supported by adequate investments. however, many providers have not made sufficient investments because of uncertainties in the program, inadequate upside opportunity, and continued concerns about fee-for-service (ffs) utilization. the current mssp approach has not driven enough investment by enough providers to fully test the aco model. some providers are merely participating today but not fully investing. as a result, the program has not delivered optimal results for the trust fund. we view this proposed rule as a real opportunity to build on the lessons learned to date and maximize trust fund savings. in order to do this, mssp should be viewed as an alternative to medicare advantage.\n our strong commitment to population-based models and the mssp is demonstrated by our six years of participation across multiple markets. we serve more than 200,000 medicare beneficiaries across the mssp and next generation aco models. to support our transformation work and ability to assume risk, we have made significant investments in - and implemented - market-specific and systemwide infrastructure and operational changes. for instance, we recently initiated systemwide implementation of the epic platform\u00e2\u0080\u0093 the largest \"single instance\" implementation effort across a health care system to date.\n in the last three years (2015-2017), trinity health has earned $31.2 million in shared savings through the mssp; additionally we earned $7 million in shared savings through the next generation aco program in 2016. the shared savings earned helped us recoup some of our initial investments and make new ones to generate additional savings and deliver high-quality care. in the past two years, most of our physician-led clinically integrated networks (cins) have transitioned their medicare acos to downside risk models. as a result, most of our medicare acos are now in a position to assume sufficient risk to qualify for basic track level e in the proposed rule and qualify for participation in an advanced alternative payment model.\n\n 3\n\n the comments we offer are informed by our experience transitioning to models that align with the more advanced levels of risk under the proposed basic and enhanced tracks. our recommendations fall into three major categories \u00e2\u0080\u0093 increasing upside opportunity for acos, aligning medicare advantage (ma) and aco program rules, and reducing regulatory burden on participating providers. we believe the comments we offer support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goals to encourage new providers to join the program, to retain existing high-performing acos, and to foster the long- term sustainability of the program.\n\n1. increasing upside opportunity to attract new and retain existing participants \n as an organization that has medicare acos in 18 physician-led cins creating value for patients and commercial, medicaid and ma payers in 22 different communities, we have substantial experience with the changes that occur when providers come together to form an aco. we have seen how changes to the care model and delivery system improve coordination across the continuum and generate tangible improvements in patient outcomes. based on our experience, we believe that if cms wants acos to assume downside risk more quickly than under the current mssp program, there must be sufficient opportunity for shared savings to support early investments in infrastructure. the upside opportunity must be sufficient enough to account for the business risk of participating in a model that does not meet the level of transparency, predictability and simplicity of other risk models such as medicare advantage. we also know that there are significant financial costs and investment risks associated with the start-up of these models. provider capacity to assume business risk for a population varies depending on the transparency, predictability, and simplicity of the financial model under a contract or program. while most of our acos are now capable of taking on advanced clinical risk and accountability, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to reduce the shared savings opportunity in the mssp \u00e2\u0080\u0093 coupled with the structure of the underlying financial model \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is likely to result in fewer participants and a less sustainable model for those remaining. during this period when we are all still learning, there is an alternative. the pathway to success includes increasing upside potential and broadening waivers. this would make it attractive to invest without undue risk. our proposal provides a stronger case for providers to lean into risk and transition to population-based models.\n trinity health recommends that 80% upside potential be available at all levels of the basic and enhanced tracks. this is necessary to level the playing field with medicare advantage, attract new providers into the program and to ensure that participating acos make the needed investments in infrastructure and operational changes to support care transformation and the ability to assume greater levels of risk over time. this will result in larger trust fund savings. trinity health urges cms to simplify the program by making all shared saving programs 80% upside, this would include the following bold changes to the proposed shared savings levels in the basic and enhanced tracks: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 basic track: levels a and b should include a shared savings rate of 80%; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 basic track: levels c and d should include a shared savings rate of 80% balanced by an increase in shared risk levels to meet advanced apm criteria; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 basic track: level e should include a shared savings rate of 80% and maintain the proposed shared risk structure; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 enhanced track: include a shared savings rate of 80% and maintain the proposed shared risk structure; and \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 enhanced track: include a full capitation model for advanced acos.\n 4\n\n invest in the care management, cehrt, and other capabilities needed to successfully manage population health and costs.\n our proposed changes to the shared risk levels under basic track levels c and d would also qualify these models as advanced apms and better prepare acos to move into the enhanced track. this would create more opportunity for physicians to participate in advanced apms and models that encourage the delivery of value-based care. we believe these changes to basic track levels c and d would require relatively minor adjustments and would help create a better business case for the aco model, and achieve cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal of increasing the number of advanced apms available to eligible clinicians.\n trinity health supports the option for all acos to choose levels of risk in the basic track upon enrollment. rather than make shared savings-only models less appealing, we urge cms to focus its efforts on making models with downside financial risk more attractive while continuing to support shared savings-only models. contracts without downside risk can result in net savings for medicare as acos gain experience. a 2016 study examined aco results between 2012-2014 and found that net savings were accruing to medicare by 2014.2 our own experience, and now research, also support that to optimize results for medicare, acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 regardless of revenue level - should have the option to remain in basic track level a for at least three years. a recent study by naacos found that between 2013 and 2015, mssp acos achieved net savings of $542 million, but found that it takes time for quality improvement and cost reduction to occur and performance improved with time.3  under this proposal, providers are already at risk because they have only three years to position for downside risk or lose those investments and the network they have built around them when cms terminates their contract. this creates potent leverage for cms. in the most recent results on the 2017 performance year, upside only acos generated more savings per beneficiary than those bearing risk under mssp tracks 2 and 3. there is real opportunity to build on the lessons to-date and achieve larger trust fund savings.\n agreement period trinity health supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to move from three to five year contract agreement periods. we believe that longer contract agreements increase predictability and stability for providers and health systems that are making investments and other system changes to support participation. we also support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to align the contract length with other innovation center models.\n termination from program trinity health supports efforts to encourage continual quality improvement among acos. however, it is important to balance encouraging provider participation in the program with incentives to become high-performers. given that it often takes several years of participating in a model to see savings, we recommend that providers have three years to demonstrate the ability to generate savings. if at the end of that time, savings cannot be generated, cms could then terminate contracts with those participants.\n however, we ask that cms allow acos that include cpc+ to remain in upside-only tracks until cpc+ care management fees can be fully incorporated into the benchmark in order to prevent premature termination from the program for those acos simply due to program overlap. the cpc+ program fills a critical gap in advanced primary care payment models. while the cpc+ care management fees are accounted for as aco expenditures, they are not included in the historical cost base for an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark, which harms those entities that both participate as an\n 2 mcwilliams, j. michael, changes in medicare shared savings program savings from 2013 to 2014, jama, research letter, october 25, 2016. 3 mechanic,  robert, gaus, clifton, medicare shared savings program produces substantial savings: new policies should promote aco growth, health affairs, september 11, 2018.\n 5\n\n aco and are also transforming primary care practices. in any market where the vast majority of primary care providers are in cpc+, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal will negatively impact acos. we have seen this in two of our own markets, where the cpc+ expenditures create an additional hurdle to meeting an already high msr.\n aco participation options based on high/low-revenue and prior participation we ask that cms allow high-revenue acos to remain in level e of the basic track for a second agreement period. high-revenue acos, by nature of their size and inclusion of providers across the continuum of care, are likely to have greater responsibility for care coordination across inpatient and outpatient settings than low-revenue acos. however, high-revenue acos are also better positioned to drive more appropriate care utilization across the continuum and decrease unnecessary hospital events over time. allowing high-revenue aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to remain in level e for a second agreement period would help ensure these large entities can successfully move to greater levels of risk that require systemwide investments and operational and infrastructure changes.\n as proposed, the increase in risk from level e to the enhanced track is significant. as a result, we ask that cms allow high-revenue aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to remain in level e for a second agreement period to ensure these large entities have the time needed to successfully manage the move to greater business and clinical risk. restricting the ability to remain in basic track level e for a second agreement period for high-revenue acos could lead to significant attrition of current track 1 participants.\n given that high-revenue acos are responsible for a greater share of healthcare spending than low- revenue acos, it is reasonable to ask them to assume greater levels of risk and/or at a faster pace than low-revenue acos. however, cms should also take into account that larger systems must invest in change across a much broader delivery \"footprint\" and so may require additional investments over multiple years to make transformative system changes. when making these higher investments, these acos are taking on much greater business risk and so need a longer time to recoup investments.\n high-revenue acos can include hospitals, physician groups, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies. depending on their starting point, they may require different amounts of time to successfully transform. increasing the amount of risk assumed can support alignment of incentives for the delivery of person-centered care and savings for the system; however, it also requires additional time and investment to implement changes across the care continuum. for hospitals and health systems, necessary changes are far reaching, including changes to discharge processes, transitions to nursing home care, and delivery of home-based care. additionally, care delivery transformation entails investing in cehrt across the system. for example, this year trinity health committed to implementing the largest single instance of epic in the country, an integrated platform for population health, ehr and revenue cycle systems. the goal is to enable a better care experience for the people we serve across all our markets, providing a single, comprehensive health record with seamless access to clinical and billing information. epic also aims to improve the experience for our physicians and clinicians through integrated information to improve patient care and support seamless handoffs.\n 6\n\n to move to a risk-based model. in addition, for those who have chosen a zero or low msr, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside the corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d creates a double-edged sword where they are penalized for taking on more downside risk. our own experience suggests this is not sufficient and will not allow acos the opportunity to make strategic decisions regarding performance improvement which allow them to demonstrate success in future program years. as noted above, we have participated in mssp for six years and most of our acos are now in risk-bearing tracks and generating savings\u00e2\u0080\u0094demonstrating savings can be achieved, but can take a longer investment horizon.\n qualifying as an advanced apm trinity health believes apms are key to driving system transformation that improves quality and care for beneficiaries and reduces health care costs. as noted in our comments on the basic and enhanced tracks, we recommend that cms make changes to basic tracks c and d to allow them to qualify as advanced apms. in addition, many of our other recommendations, including increasing upside opportunity for basic and enhanced track acos, and allowing high- revenue acos to remain in level e for a second agreement period, will also ensure that acos remain in the program and that more join \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thereby increasing participation options in advanced apms.\n\n2. creating a level playing field between mssp acos and medicare advantage \n we believe it is critical for cms to align participation rules across the aco and medicare advantage (ma) programs to ensure a level playing field for all providers, access to care for all beneficiaries, and lower costs for the medicare program. we applaud cms for moving toward similar waiver opportunities and beneficiary assignment methodology. we offer a number of additional suggestions to align rules across the two including: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 aligning hcc risk adjustment methodologies between the mssp and ma; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 broadening flexibility within mssp on alternate sites of care where that care can be delivered safely but is currently not allowed (e.g., infusion, hospital at home). \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 aligning care management flexibilities including determinations as to level and site of care; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 testing value-based insurance design (vbid) features in acos as they assume greater levels of risk; and, \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 maintaining the current 70% regional adjustment in the benchmark and moving to a completely regional benchmark, which is more aligned with ma regional benchmarking.\n trinity health believes that alignment of rules between ma and acos will further allow acos to lean into risk by assuming full accountability over time. trinity health strongly advises aligning hcc risk adjustment methodologies across both aco and ma models. leveling the risk playing field between ma and acos would make the aco model more attractive to organizations willing to take on greater financial risk and therefore drive greater investment in care transformation. otherwise, the trend of organizations shifting investments solely to ma will continue. this migration from traditional medicare to ma creates a perverse outcome, driving up costs for the medicare trust fund. equalizing the hcc coding rules for ma and acos will curb provider movement toward ma only. additionally, this will curb further depletion of the trust fund, reining in overall medicare spend and slowing this transfer of wealth from taxpayers to investors.\n choice of beneficiary assignment methodology trinity health supports the ability of acos to choose either prospective or retrospective assignment. the ability to choose prospective assignment supports an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to manage care as they assume greater levels of risk. however, we support giving acos the choice as to whether they use prospective or retrospective alignment. this should be a clinical and business decision made by each aco.\n\n\n\n\n 7\n\n beneficiary \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d trinity health supports affirmative recognition of the relationship between a beneficiary and an aco, as this can support patient engagement and care management. however, this must be implemented in a way that reduces administrative burden. to this end, cms should explore ways to implement beneficiary opt-in in more simplified ways than early efforts through the next generation and pioneer aco programs. for example, the existing process requires managing and tracking mailings, which require financial and human resources without a substantial impact on enrollment. we ask that cms ensure that implementation of a beneficiary opt-in option not also introduce new administrative costs to acos, drawing down of funding that would otherwise support care delivery. finally, we believe beneficiary opt-in is an opportunity to align aco and ma rules. however, beneficiaries will need basic education on their choices (e.g. ma, acos, and traditional fee-for- service) from cms so they can make informed decisions about how and where to receive their care.\n waivers trinity health supports the proposed expansion of the telehealth and snf 3-day waivers, and allowing acos to provide beneficiary incentives. we also recommend that cms reduce the reporting burden related to these waivers by relying on existing claims or other available data. similarly, we recommend that cms acknowledge the investment waivers require and include when rebasing benchmarks.\n for acos to lean into greater levels or risk, additional waivers are needed that facilitate the delivery of the right care at the right time. we urge cms to make all waivers available to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0094as this will support flexibility needed to deliver high-quality, appropriate care\u00e2\u0080\u0094and build in appropriate monitoring to identify potential abuse.\n through existing waivers, aco participants have been able to better meet the needs of patients in innovative ways. however, there is uncertainty regarding the availability of particular waivers as a result of limited guidance from cms on the intended scope of, or applicability to, certain aco participants. the uncertainty has resulted in acos not choosing to opt-in to an available waiver due to concerns over noncompliance during implementation. if the expanded waivers are finalized, we urge cms to expedite regular updates to frequently asked questions (faqs) and other guidance and/or commentaries in response to aco questions. we also ask that cms and the office of the inspector general provide options for acos to request guidance regarding the applicability and implementation of waivers without having to ask for a traditional advisory opinion.\n beneficiary incentives we believe that as providers assume greater levels of risk, they should have more levers available to manage and engage patients in their care. as a result, trinity health generally supports greater flexibility to provide beneficiary incentives that facilitate greater engagement with - and care management from - a regular set of providers. however, we would encourage cms to ensure that beneficiary incentives, as described in the proposed rule, do not create an unlevel playing field among small and large acos.\n in addition to the cash-equivalent incentives described in the proposed rule, cms should consider health-related incentives such as co-pay waivers for primary care services and preventive services received within the aco such as immunizations, the medicare diabetes prevention program (mdpp), and screenings (e.g. cancer, diabetes).\n 8\n\n share learnings with newer participants and help guide future model evolution. sustainability of the program is also an important consideration \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we believe that entities should be rewarded that are historically efficient and high-performers in their market. last, retaining the current regional adjustment in the benchmark would also align the aco program with ma given the regional nature of the benchmarking and bid process in that program.\n benchmarking - risk adjustment trinity health supports the addition of a symmetrical cap on risk scores given that the health profile of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patient population is likely to change over time. the +/- 3 percent cap for the mssp aco program is also more consistent with the next generation aco program, moving closer to continuity in methodology across tracks and programs. however, extending the cap to five years will penalize acos that treat high-risk patients or that retain patients whose burden of illness increases over time.\n\n3. reducing regulatory burden \n trinity health supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal to reduce regulatory burden \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and appreciates recent initiatives, such as patients over paperwork. we also applaud the implementation of changes to the mssp program authorized by congress in the bipartisan budget act of 2018 that reduce regulatory barriers to providing person-centered care, such as expanding the use of telehealth, promoting beneficiary choice, and incenting the use of necessary primary care services.\n cms can further reduce regulatory burdens by providing greater flexibility or waivers to support the delivery of patient-centered care and services in the home. often, patients can be safely treated in the home for conditions that would meet hospital level criteria, and yet a drg can only be paid if that care is delivered in an inpatient facility. cms should remove site of service barriers to enable the administration of drugs based on clinical appropriateness, patient preference and need, rather than place of service  (e.g. permitting aco providers to perform home infusions or other supportive care when clinically safe and appropriate. trinity health also supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to create new collaborations between acos and standalone prescription drug plans (pdps) and to examine how part d drugs could be included in the mssp to further manage the total cost of care. these actions would also further align the program with medicare advantage.\n there is also an opportunity to minimize administrative burden and costs related to the mandatory first, face-to-face visit, beneficiary notification provision. cms can offer flexibility to acos in implementing this requirement, which would both reduce administrative costs and facilitate effective communication with beneficiaries. for instance, cms could allow practices to make a poster prominently available containing the necessary information versus a hard-copy at each patient visits; permit a degree of freedom in how this is recorded and documented from a compliance standpoint; and, provide flexibility in timing of the notification such as tying it to any visit throughout the year versus the first visit of the year.\n last, we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to require one group practice reporting option (gpro) reporting period for 2019 and to acknowledge the aco participant list as of july 1, 2019 to determine the gpro quality reporting samples as this will reduce administrative burden for participating providers.\n minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss ratio (mlr) trinity health supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow acos to decide incremental msr based on the individual aco's risk tolerance. these options are important for individual acos to assume the level of business risk they are capable of and willing to take, based on their own business decisions.\n 9\n\n industry and cms must work together to rapidly adopt existing consensus-driven core measure sets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as cms has set out to do through the meaningful measures initiative - while working to identify the next generation of core measures. there should also be an emphasis on advancing and adopting patient-reported outcomes measures (proms), which are critical for creating a people-centered health system.\n we also support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed addition of opioid use measures. these efforts will support and align with our systemwide opioid use reduction (our) initiative. trinity health is committed to partnering with all stakeholders to address opioid use through prevention, intervention, treatment and recovery initiatives. a comprehensive approach to the opioid epidemic is imperative to reducing opioid harm and promoting people-centered care.\n last, while statutory changes are necessary, we reiterate the importance of aligning 42 cfr part 2 (part 2) confidentiality requirements for sharing a patient's substance use disorder records with the requirements in the health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa). unlike hipaa, part 2 does not allow for sharing or re-disclosure of identifiable substance use disorder information for treatment, payment or health care operations (\"tpo\") purposes without patient consent. moreover, part 2 requires regulated programs to provide a notice to recipients of identifiable substance use disorder information noting that the information cannot be re-disclosed. from a compliance perspective, the different standards between hipaa and part 2 have made it extremely difficult for our hospitals and health systems to know when and how this information may be shared, including within individual hospitals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 despite the importance of care coordination for individuals with substance use disorders.\n cehrt/promoting interoperability trinity health supports alignment across all medicare programs including the quality payment program (qpp) and the aco programs. however, we ask that cms make gradual increases in cehrt usage requirements in both the qpp and aco programs from 50 to 75% for advanced apm status. this is especially critical for small practices and acos with limited resources to invest in cehrt.\n overlap of other advanced apms trinity health has long been concerned about the launch of new models that overlap with existing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and population-based models- such as acos. cms must consider the overlap of the cpc+ and aco programs in particular. as previously noted, we recommend that cms allow acos that include cpc+ participants to remain in upside only tracks until cpc+ care management fees can be fully incorporated into the benchmark to prevent premature termination from the program.\n social determinants of health trinity health is committed to advancing the health of individuals and populations. we strongly believe that payment and delivery models should support addressing the social determinants of health, which research has shown drive health outcomes and costs. as cms seeks to improve the aco program, we believe this is an area where the agency can continue to work with state, regional and local stakeholders to find ways to integrate social services into care management programs. in addition, cms should examine ways to adjust payment in apms based upon sociodemographic factors to support holistic care of patients.\n 10\n\n\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 final reconciliation in years with these circumstances should not only mitigate shared losses, but provide parity for the msr and mlr for acos who just missed their msr or exceeded their mlr because of the natural disaster and associated the in part a costs; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 quality measure reporting exceptions and changes should be available to all acos impacted by a natural disaster, not just those who cannot report quality data and all acos should receive the higher of the 2018 or the 2019 star rating for each cahps measure; and, \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 adjusting for natural disaster related impacts at the beneficiary and claims level by expanding the use of the natural disaster payment modifier codes to capture unsafe places of discharge and allowing for an additional 6-12 months to correct and resubmit claims to allow for inclusion of natural disaster modifiers.\n\n", "0424": "please see attached comments from anthem,

medicare shared savings program (mssp); accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success\n dear administrator verma:\n anthem appreciates this opportunity to provide comments in response to the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099) proposed rule regarding changes to the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and accountable care organizations (acos) published on august 17, 2018. anthem continues to applaud cms for its ongoing attention to the mssp and its commitment to promoting value-based care.\n anthem is committed to delivering high-value, affordable care that improves the lives of our members. our health plan companies deliver quality products and services that give their members access to the care they need. with over 73 million people served by its affiliated companies, approximately 700,000 medicare beneficiaries served in 21 states through its medicare advantage plans and almost 300,000 members through part d prescription drug plans, anthem is one of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading health benefits companies. for more information about anthem\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family of companies, please visit\nwww.antheminc.com/companies.   \n\n anthem shares cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 commitment to improving the design of acos and supports models that deliver high-quality, efficient care. anthem currently partners with many acos in our footprint states. we believe acos are one vehicle for care delivery transformation and improvement, but, like many innovative programs, they require consistent evaluation and refinement. accordingly, we offer the following high-level recommendations, followed by more detailed comments and recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2\n executive summary\n anthem is committed to innovation in health care payment and delivery, and we continue to work closely with our provider partners to promote a smooth and meaningful transition to value-based care. we believe the best way to carry through on this commitment is to emphasize transparency, flexibility, and efficiency. ensuring an open, inclusive process that considers the unique nature of the practices and patients with which we all engage will help patients, providers, payers, and the government to realize the benefits of the transition to value.\n with these principles in mind, anthem highlights several priority recommendations. our detailed comments on the provisions of the proposed rule follow below.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 commit to providing timely guidance to acos to allow for thoughtful consideration of program changes: anthem recognizes the significant proposed changes to the mssp and the time and resources providers will need to plan for their participation in the program. to ensure that providers are well-equipped to make informed decisions and to maximize participation in the mssp, anthem recommends that cms provide detailed documentation and guidance on the proposed changes, timelines, and deadlines for providers interested in the program. we urge cms to provide these assessments and guidance in a reasonable time before annual program changes are allowed or required.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 ensure a level playing field with medicare advantage (ma): as the mssp grows, anthem believes it is important to ensure a level playing field across acos and ma plans with respect to provisions such as spending targets, beneficiary protections, and marketing guidelines. as such, anthem recommends that cms refine the mssp to ensure parity with ma plans and markets.\n\n specific recommendations\n\n\na. aco participation parameters  \n\n aco agreement period\n anthem supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal for a 5-year aco agreement period. anthem believes that longer agreement periods provide a meaningful length of time to measure aco successes and challenges. as the mssp matures, it will be important to evaluate and measure aco performance, and we believe the 5-year agreement period will allow for a more robust evaluation. this improved measurement will give cms and interested parties the information needed to continue to improve the program.\n 3\n potential strategy could be for cms to permit these acos to extend their contracts for one additional year, in order that the acos may evaluate their options under this new regulation.\n anthem believes that providers who are currently in the program and providers who are considering joining the program should have more time to assess the different participation options and the interaction with other programs. we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continuation of the mssp, but believe providers need an appropriate amount of time to determine their participation in the program to maximize quality and financial outcomes. because the final rule may not be published until next year, a july 1, 2019 start date will not provide acos with enough time to prepare for the mssp changes and consider initiating or changing their position relative to or within the program.\n aco definitions\n anthem strongly supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed delineation of low-revenue/high-revenue acos and experienced/inexperienced acos, but believes that detailed descriptions of each aco definition should be provided well in advance of any decision deadline, and cms should consider the effects of incentives behind different sharing rates for low-revenue acos. we also request that cms provide timelines and detailed processes for how it will monitor, review, and communicate changes in the proposed rule and when it will determine which acos fall into the different categories. anthem believes that cms should determine a date when cms has completed its assessment of all acos regarding their categorization as low-revenue or high-revenue and disseminate this information to providers so that they have enough time to determine which track they may be required to join for the upcoming performance year. it is important that cms provide ample time to allow acos to consider their current track/level, make any changes to their track/level, and then execute a coordinated transition into any new track/level. in addition, anthem believes that providing more detailed processes governing the designation of aco categories will help to protect against the potential for aco gaming whereby acos use creative business organization strategies to ensure that they are able to remain in the low-revenue designation.\n anthem also urges cms to consider whether it needs to adopt a higher sharing rate for low-revenue acos in the initial years of these changes. while such different treatment may be appropriate after careful review of performance information, there is likely to be insufficient information showing that a preferential system for low-revenue acos will yield higher participation or greater overall program savings. in addition, it is not clear that revenue alone is the best qualifying characteristic to base preferential savings terms. cms may want to consider whether there are other characteristics that could incentivize greater participation and better performance metrics, such as proven efficiency in the market.\n aco track changes and transition to risk\n 4\n anthem supports aco transition to risk. however, we acknowledge the need for balance in shared savings and losses to incentivize robust program participation. this balance is especially important for those providers with more limited experience with risk. for the mssp to be successful, there must be robust participation and we fear that the proposed changes to the shared savings rates might lead some providers to reconsider their participation and move away from the program.\n anthem believes that cms should consider a smaller reduction in the shared savings rate from track 1 (50 percent share savings rate) to the basic track (25 percent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 50 percent share savings rate). cms should also consider smoothing this transition to risk to enable greater participation. for example, in the basic track, cms could allow a 40 percent savings rate for the lowest level of participation. as an alternative, cms may wish to reduce the shared savings opportunity if an aco is not performing adequately or if providers do not transition to risk over time. this would help ensure that providers are moving through the tracks and taking on increasing risk. for example, all levels within the basic track could include a 50 percent savings rate, but if providers do not transition to risk within a set time period, the savings rate would decrease to 25 percent savings rate or lower. this could be an attractive alternative option to the requirement to advance to a higher level within the basic track each year.\n\n\nb. benchmark methodology \n\n anthem supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to incorporate regional expenditures into the aco benchmarking methodology for all acos in their first agreement period to create a more accurate and fairer benchmark for all mssp acos. for the mssp to be successful, accurate benchmarks must be constructed. anthem supported cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 refinement of the benchmark methodology in 2016. we believe that as more providers join acos and a greater number of patients are aligned to acos, an appropriate benchmark will be vital so acos are accurately measured and rewarded for their performance in the program.\n overall, while we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to incorporate regional expenditures into aco benchmarking methodology, we ask that cms ensure a level playing field across acos and ma plans with respect to spending targets. the metric for efficient, cost-effective care should be consistent across providers within a region, including ma plans.\n\n\nc. beneficiary provisions \n\n beneficiary opt-in methodology\n anthem supports the process in which beneficiaries can select their own providers and be attributed to acos. however, anthem believes the proposed opt-in methodology would create an administrative burden for providers and cms. in addition, we believe it may be possible for cms to amend the existing voluntary alignment methodology which already allows beneficiaries to choose to opt-in. this would effectively operationalize the proposed change without requiring a new process to be developed.\n 5\n instead, we support improvements to existing methodologies in effort to avoid unnecessary confusion and burden.\n anthem is also concerned that the proposed opt-in methodology for acos could overlap and interfere with ma enrollment. there is a reasonable concern that the proposed opt-in methodology would not have the appropriate regulations in place, such as with ma, and could allow providers to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccherry-pick\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009clemon-drop\u00e2\u0080\u009d patients who are more likely to help or hurt their performance, respectively. overall, anthem believes that when designing the mssp, cms should ensure parity with ma (e.g., same marketing guidelines, same beneficiary protections, etc.), and clearly define for enrollees the purpose and impact of opting in.\n beneficiary engagement\n anthem appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 effort to improve beneficiary engagement through the proposed beneficiary incentive program. incentives can be effective tools to help enrollees access and use care properly, especially care that could reduce spending at a later time. however, anthem is concerned with the lack of safeguards and guidelines around the use of these incentives. the absence of additional safeguards could present opportunities for acos to game the system. anthem believes that for this process to be effective, there would need to be checks and balances\u00e2\u0080\u0094including an audit process, defined guidance and limitations on how to use incentive payments\u00e2\u0080\u0094to avoid patient cherry-picking and to mitigate ma parity concerns. such checks could ensure that acos are not able to specifically target and engage certain individuals to selectively control their participant risk profile. accordingly, anthem would appreciate cms providing more descriptive examples of permissible incentive programs and implementing a system to respond to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 questions regarding these incentives.\n anthem also believes that, with respect to incentive payments, the proposed process would be more effective if providers are permitted to control the incentive payments at the point of care, and not the aco legal entity. in addition, incentive payments should be directed toward those activities that are likely to promote well-being and health management. anthem recommends that cms provide additional clarification and guardrails around the form and allowed applications of incentive payments.\n\n\nd. aco quality measures \n\n electronic health record (ehr) quality measure\n anthem supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to eliminate the quality measure aco-11: use of certified ehr technology beginning in py2019 and align certified ehr technology (cehrt) requirements in mssp with those in the qpp. anthem believes it is important to encourage the adoption of cehrt and reduce complexity for as many providers as possible. as such, anthem supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to require acos that would not be considered aapms to attest that at least 50 percent of eligible clinicians use cehrt and to require acos that would be considered aapms to attest that at least 75 percent of eligible clinicians use cehrt.\n 6\n opioid quality measures\n anthem supports the inclusion of different quality measures in the mssp and cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to advance the aco quality measure set to be more outcomes-based, meaningful, and less burdensome to providers and other stakeholders. anthem also supports the measures outlined in the proposed rule that relate to the opioid crisis. anthem is taking a leadership role in addressing the opioid crisis through a holistic strategy focused on each aspect of substance abuse \u00e2\u0080\u0094 prevention/deterrence, treatment, and recovery. we have already instituted a comprehensive suite of services designed to address opioid dependency and misuse throughout our commercial, medicare, and medicaid lines of business. such services range from medication-assisted treatment (mat), to peer recovery supports, community treatment options, and chronic pain management. we are committed to continuing to work with providers and government officials to address opioid abuse.\n although anthem supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 development of opioid-related quality measures, we would like cms to keep in mind that cancer is not the only diagnosis for which an opioid is necessary to deliver clinically appropriate end-of-life care. we believe that end-of-life care should be addressed in a holistic manner and be broadened beyond cancer. overall, we support and encourage cms to continue addressing the opioid crisis through innovative quality measures, protocols, and recommendations.\n\n\ne.  collaboration with prescription drug plans (pdps) \n\n anthem supports innovative collaborations between acos and other stakeholders. however, anthem is concerned that due to thin profit margins in part d, there is limited room for pdps to work with acos without impacting the part d structure. in addition, without appropriate scale, which is difficult to achieve, providers will not find savings meaningful enough given the required work in these arrangements (e.g., data sharing, quality reporting, etc.). anthem believes that coordinating care and benefits across all sources of beneficiary coverage is critical to ensuring efficient and appropriate care.\n while anthem agrees that encouraging acos and part d sponsors to collaborate is important, there are significant benefits and coverage requirements in part d that may hamper the potential for coordination and innovation. anthem recommends that cms consider allowing greater part d coverage and benefit flexibility (especially formulary flexibility), with appropriate guardrails, to allow acos and part d plans to work together to ensure the most effective and efficient use of a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part d coverage. overall, anthem supports these collaborations and partnerships, but before implementing them, we urge cms to evaluate the effects on each program on an individual-level and consider testing prior to full implementation.\n\n\nf.  fee-for-service benefit enhancement waivers \n\n 7\n refinement and research new waivers that will improve quality of care, beneficiary access, and program outcomes.\n *****\n anthem appreciates this opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed rule. we look forward to working with cms to continue to strengthen the medicare shared savings program. should you have any questions or wish to discuss our comments further, please contact alison armstrong at alison.armstrong@anthem.com or (805) 336-5072.\n sincerely,\n\n\n anthony mader vice president, public

pathways to success\n dear administrator verma:\n this letter serves to provide comments on the centers for medicare & medicaid services proposed rule that would redesign the medicare shared savings program, encouraging organizations to transition to two-sided risk models.\n at west florida aco, llc we have recognized the value of risk management behaviors necessary to change the health care system. since our inception in 2012 as one of the first 27 mssp acos and currently a track 3 risk engagement  participant, we  have  dedicated  our  practice  transformation  exercise  to  the  heart  of  the  advanced payment models. therefore, we want to concentrate our comments on the thesis of your policy recommendations pertaining risk taking.\n our  proposals  are  simple: decrease  downside  risk  on  the  enhanced  track  and  start  \"pathways  to  success\" regulations on january 1, 2020, extending the agreement for an extra full year for acos with contracts ending december 31, 2018.\n decrease downside risk:\n west florida aco has demonstrated the capacity to sustain proper participation in the highest of risk-taking tracks available in the program. but with upcoming changes on benchmark as we enter our third contract, the downside risk may be financially challenging for our aco.\n as a physician led, physician-owned aco, filled with small primary practices, in order to partner with cms' intent to increase risk taking in the delivery of accountable care, we propose the following:\n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n west florida aco, llc 3543 little rd., suite c trinity, fl  34655 p:  1-855-955-west f:  727-498-5016\nwww.westfloridaaco.com \n\n\n for enhanced track acos, we propose to apply a loss sharing limit that is the lesser of 20% of the participants' revenue or 10% of the updated benchmark.  decreasing the downside risk will make the path to participation more appealing for many acos.\n please note the following example:\n when  comparing basic  level e  and the  enhanced  tracks, the  levels  of  exposure  to  losses and repayment mechanisms are considerably unbalanced. for example, an aco with an estimated historical benchmark of 12k per capita, which participates in the enhanced track with 10,000 beneficiaries would potentially receive 50% more of shared savings but, would be exposing itself to losses 37.5 times more, with a much greater repayment mechanism. this aco would risk losing $18 million. while in level e, the  exposure  is  4%  of  benchmark  or  8%  of  the  revenue  (assuming 5% of participant' s  revenue,  as demonstrated  in  the  table  below). the  aco  in  level  e  would  risk  $480,000  with  a  much lower repayment mechanism.\n basic track - level e enhanced\n\n cms should decrease the downside risk overall for the enhanced track if the desired outcome of the proposed rule is for acos to take risk. lower downside risk would certainly be more attractive to those not only  wanting to join  the aco movement of improving  healthcare and reducing costs, but  also moving forward from the basic track to the enhanced model. this is especially true for low revenue entities.  basic  level  e  track  is  designed  appropriately, but  the enhanced  track  risk  is  simply unbearable. the  proposed rule will  decrease  the  likelihood  of participation from low  revenue  acos. west  florida  aco is accustomed with bearing  risk. unfortunately, due to  the proposed rules, keeping intact the current risk of track 3 acos, we are forced to rethink strategically and operationally. fundamentally, we may be forced out of the program due to the downside risk and extensive operational costs to be successful. we urge cms to provide a softer downside risk that facilitates proper investment and enough cushion in the benchmark.\n participation agreement start date january 1, 2020:\n due to the significant revisions contained in the proposed rule, we agree with cms to cancel the 2018 application cycle.\n\n

2018,  should be offered  the opportunity  to extend that agreement by renewing for a fourth performance full year, which should last twelve months from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019.\n under  the proposed  rule,  having two  separate performance years,  january  1  through  june  30 under current mssp rules and then july 1 through december 31 under the new pathways to success, would be extremely burdening, not only for cms, but for acos as well. managing and implementing necessary modifications  to  operational  processes  for  two  different  sets of populations  to  meet  program  and organization expectations in one year would be considerably taxing and overall challenging. moreover, receiving separate reconciliation reports for the two performance periods only adds to the complexity of the program.\n as you can see, minimization of downside  risk and extension of participation agreement, become critical components for experienced, successful, and willing acos committed to the principles of the triple aim and willing to continue in the enhanced track. no changes in these two elements directly affect our capacity to continue.\n we appreciate the opportunity to provide you these comments. our hope is that they are useful in your considerations  for  proper  modifications.  should  you have additional need for more information regarding our participation experience and future recommendations, we are always available for further discussions.\n sincerely, jayadeva chowdappa chief executive officer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n", "0427": "we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) proposed rule to make changes to the regulations for the medicare shared savings program (mssp) for accountable care organizations (acos). we are pleased at cmss decision to move to performance-based risk and allow other program flexibilities, to ensure lasting program integrity and sustainability for acos. as highlighted in these comments, pinnacle was already working on an mssp proposal that has been easily adjusted, and in fact, enhanced by the changes proposed in this rule. we are ready to implement this program and would like to have an opportunity to do so prior to the proposed july 2019 start date. the sooner we can get medicare beneficiaries into this superior payment model, the better their care will be. we would suggest that cms is leaving significant savings on the table by waiting three full quarters to initiate what is essentially a program ready to start today.\r\n\r\npinnacle integrated medicine is a clinically integrated network of 150 independent providers and growing, in high need areas across the pacific northwest and alaska. our model is independent pcp centric and as a result we have been having success in commercial value-based contracts for over three years now, transforming healthcare across multiple markets. as such, the administrations proposed direction for the new aco program is a refreshing redesign of the original aco program, which had limitations in its ability to truly transform healthcare. while acos under the original program have both grown rapidly in recent years and provided a foundation to build from, the result was a consolidation of healthcare choices with mixed success. additionally, those choices are increasingly coming from a fewer number of large hospital centric healthcare systems, directing the center of care away from pcp providers who best understand their patients. hospital systems are a necessary component to transforming healthcare but will continue to struggle to achieve savings under the existing program as they have to cannibalize their most abundant revenue streams to truly achieve the types of savings desired within the aco program. the business model and financial model must be aligned to truly transform healthcare and systems without this alignment will never achieve savings unless they are otherwise at risk. this is not the case for independent pcp centric acos whose business model and financial model are aligned regardless of whether theyre at risk or not.\r\n\r\nthe proposed rule changes will truly be a pathway to success creating an environment where independent pcp providers, who have shown success in all aco tracks, can be back at the center of care without being torn between providing preventative care that results in a reduction in hospital related occurrences and loss of the financial revenue that goes along with that. the change will also stop additional unnecessary consolidation in an industry that are already lacks choices.\r\n\r\nwith the analysis performed against 2016 results, cms has empirical evidence to support the decision to redesign the program as outlined and we are supportive of the recommended changes. our experience with independent pcp centric medical groups within a clinically integrated network participating in upside only commercial value-based contracts, like those outlined in cmss pathway to success proposal, provides additional evidence that the model cms is proposing is headed in the right direction. as a result, we would like to offer a demonstration project to illustrate how this new cms model will be successful in select markets starting in january 2019.\r\n\r\nwe would start the demonstration project in the spokane, wa market extending it into the alaska and idaho markets soon thereafter; these are all high need markets that arent successfully operating an aco at this time. the model would provide a care team approach utilizing integrated care managers and behavioral health specialists within existing independent pcp medical groups that have already proven success in this model on the commercial side. our technology platform and analytics team will aid the care teams by pulling clinical and claims data and putting it into a meaningful format for the care teams. additionally, because this is a physician led model with financial and business incentives aligned we can develop and truly get adoption on clinical protocols based upon the meaningful data provided as well as provide care reviews based upon the adaption of those protocols in an impactful way, both in terms of impacting quality patient care as well as controlling costs. our expertise in transforming care delivery via our pcmh accredited medical groups coupled with a pcp care team centric physician led model can be rolled out january 1, 2019 using cmss proposed changes illustrating that real transformation can be made.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \n po box 2008 \u00ef\u0082\u00a8 boise, id  83701 \u00ef\u0082\u00a8 phone 855.939.8482

may concern:\n the rural policy research institute health panel (panel) was established in 1993 to provide science-based, objective policy analysis to federal policy makers. the panel is pleased to offer comments in response to this particular  proposed  rule. our comments are  limited to  rural-specific  issues and  are  structured  to  parallel questions posed, or issues stated, by cms (not technical comments regarding specific sections of the proposed rule).\n overall,  the  panel supports  efforts to improve the medicare shared  savings program,  and  other  issues highlighted in this proposed rule. medicare represents a higher proportion of patients for most rural health care organizations and clinicians than in urban areas, so medicare policies may have a disproportionate impact on rural providers, hospitals, and beneficiaries. therefore, we hope our comments below serve as valuable input during the proposed rule finalization.\n the panel supports the recommendation described on page 41863, to extend the 3-day rule waver to services provided by a hospital or cah under the swing bed arrangement. doing so will facilitate better serving the needs of rural beneficiaries by providing covered services in their communities because the local provider is a cah (in the absence of a skilled nursing facility).\n 2 participation is likely to discourage participation by rural providers operating on very thin margins (e.g., critical access hospitals and rural physician alliances). we recommend cms consider a third-year at no downside risk for a defined group of providers (some characteristics or types \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maybe cah, fqhc, low revenue acos), in effect two years in level b prior to moving to c, d, and e in the basic track. we also recommend considering lowering the minimum savings ratio for those acos, and considering a downward adjustment to the maximum level of downside risk as a percent of the aco participant revenue and/or benchmark. these changes retain the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objective of accountability for total cost, but at a risk level more suitable for low revenue rural acos.\n recognizing  the  challenges  of  applying  the  aco  model  to  multiple  circumstances  (provider  types,  size  of healthcare organizations, number of beneficiaries in the market, capitalization of healthcare organizations), the  panel suggests creating  new demonstration projects to  achieve  objectives  of  lowering  costs  while achieving high quality. those demonstrations could include: (1) innovative payment models for rural providers\n(e.g., global budgeting); and (2) innovative delivery system reform models that bring clinical and non-clinical \n together in one organization model, with companion payment redesign.\n the

response to your request for comment regarding the above described proposed rule including proposed changes in the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policies for the shared savings program.\r\n\r\ncoastal carolina health care, pa is an independent physician owned and operated medical practice located in rural eastern north carolina. over 60% of our physician specialize in primary care. in april 2012 our aco was accepted into the medicare shared savings program and also received advance funding from cmmi through their advanced payment program. i am happy to report that we have repaid all of the funds advanced, are currently participating in track 1+, and will likely move to the enhanced track next year assuming this rule is finalized largely as approved.\r\n\r\nas you may be aware four weeks ago our primary and secondary service areas experienced storm surge, rain, winds, and flooding unlike any storm on record for our area. during and shortly after the storm we witnessed a large increase in the number of emergency room visits, increased hospital length of stay, and increased admissions to area skilled nursing homes. we also saw a decline in our office and other outpatient services. we are concerned that the net effect of these change is going to be an increase in costs. additionally, a study published earlier this year suggests that natural disasters such as this may cause medicare costs per beneficiary to increase substantially. this study entitled disaster impacts on cost and utilization of medicare details some of these trends and table 1 shows standardized cost per beneficiary being 7.6% higher than the mean in the counties most severely impacted by these events.\r\n\r\n2018 is the 3rd year of our contract and our benchmark is still tied to the national average increase and if we encounter this level of increase in costs we could have to pay back a substantial sum. additionally, we could miss out on the savings we have earned in each of the last two years. to equitably deal this type of extreme and uncontrollable circumstance, i strongly recommend cms consider providing impacted acos an alternative benchmark update that would use the higher of the national average increase or the regional increase excluding the acos population of patients.\r\n\r\nadditionally, our quality scores will be negatively impacted as we have not been able to get patients back in for visits and many have left the area. consequently, we think the most appropriate accommodation would be to look at each individual measure and provide us with the higher of our actual score, our prior year score, or the aco average. for an aco like ours that has been one of the quality leaders for many years it would not be fair to use the aco average.\r\n\r\nparticipating in the mssp has had a positive impact on the care our patients receive and we think having reasonable accommodations provided for organizations like ours that experience these types of events will help more acos make the decision to assume greater risk for the costs of their patients. thank you in advance for considering our comments.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nstephen

care organizations-pathways to success.\n dear administrator verma:\n southeastern health partners (sehp) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) medicare shared savings program (mssp) pathways to success proposed rule.  our comments reflect the collective concerns of the health systems and providers that sehp partners with to provide high value, integrated health care to our members.\n southeastern health partners participates in the current medicare shared savings program as a track 1 aco currently operating in its second performance year.  sehp has an assigned population of more than 57,000 medicare beneficiaries who are being cared for by over 2,000 multispecialty providers delivering healthcare across the 10 counties of the upstate of south carolina.  we believe that the aco model is a successful approach for encouraging providers to work together to reduce costs and improve the quality of healthcare for medicare beneficiaries.\n\n\n\n 10 s. academy st., suite 300 greenville, sc 29601\n o: 864-241-5132\n clinical innovation and business benefit from doing so. specifically, cms should consider the following two comments within the context of mssp and any new payment models:\n ensure a business case for taking on risk. cms must ensure that acos and new payment models, particularly voluntary models, provide incentives for taking on risk. the existing models to date have ignored the significant investment costs required to start or continue participation in a model. even when these costs are not incorporated into the payment model, providers will consider potential return on investment when determining whether to enter a new model. cms must recognize this dynamic and ensure that acos and other models will attract providers. specifically, cms should:\n\n\n\n 10 s. academy st., suite 300 greenville, sc 29601\n o: 864-241-5132\n cost sharing to aligned beneficiaries with specified chronic conditions, focused on the services that are of highest clinical value to them.\n determining participation options based on medicare ffs revenue and prior participation\n cms proposes to define participation options by making a distinction between low revenue acos and high revenue acos. high revenue acos are a proxy for acos that typically include hospital billing through an aco participant tin; cms defines this as an aco whose total part a and b revenue for aco participants is greater than the total parts a and b expenditures for aco assigned beneficiaries. acos falling below this threshold are considered low-revenue acos, a proxy for physician group acos. cms believes that high revenue acos are more capable of accepting higher risk than low revenue acos. cms provides fewer participation options for high revenue acos. high revenue acos with \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d can only participate in the enhanced track regardless of whether they are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cre- entering\u00e2\u0080\u009d the program. in addition, low revenue (and inexperienced) acos may operate under the basic track for a maximum of two agreement periods, whereas high revenue acos are limited to one agreement period.\n southeastern health partners strongly opposes this proposal and urges cms to eliminate the low/high revenue distinction for determining participation options. we firmly believe that all acos should be treated the same. this proposed distinction is unnecessary and harmful, as it would discourage acos that have the potential to generate substantial savings to the program from participating. cms argues that this policy decision is due in part to low revenue acos producing 2 percent of savings compared to\n0.2 percent for high-revenue acos. a premier healthcare alliance analysis of hospital-led vs. physician-\n\n\n\n 10 s. academy st., suite 300 greenville, sc 29601\n o: 864-241-5132\n\n southeastern health partners believes that the goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients. the best way to drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate, to innovate, and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare. including a hospital is an effective way to balance the need for access to specialty care while increasing the focus on primary care. one might argue that an aco should require a hospital participant and other providers across the care continuum to ensure that acos do not simply keep patients away from a particular setting but ensure patients receive care in the least restrictive setting.\n additional comments: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 risk adjustment.  southeastern health partners appreciates the risk adjustment refinements cms proposes that would eliminate the distinction of newly and continuously aligned beneficiaries for purposes of risk adjustment. this appropriately recognizes that risk scores should increase or decrease during the agreement period and that the beneficiary population underlying health changes with time. we urge cms, however, to raise the cap as +/- 3 percent is too restrictive; +/- 5 percent would more accurately account for changes in risk over a performance period. ideally, cms should provide additional incentives for acos to move to higher risk levels by providing additional flexibility in accounting for the risk of the population. this could be accomplished by aligning the cap for the enhanced track with the percentage change in risk scores for ma plans. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 regionalization.  southeastern health partners supports the cms proposal to incorporate the regional adjustment into the initial agreement period. we do not support lowering the regional contribution to below 50 percent and urge cms to maintain the current maximum contribution of 70 percent.  as such we recommend the following schedule of weights to be applied:\n\n\n\n\n 10 s. academy st., suite 300 greenville, sc 29601\n o: 864-241-5132\n schedule of weights for regional adjustment timing when subject to regional adjustment aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical spending is lower than its region aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical spending is higher than its region first time 30% 25% second time 50% 35% third  70% 50% all subsequent periods 70% 70%\n\n\n\n 10 s. academy st., suite 300 greenville, sc 29601\n o: 864-241-5132\n\n\n\n 10 s. academy st., suite 300 greenville, sc 29601\n o: 864-241-5132\n along with new g-codes proposed elsewhere in the rule (e.g., complexity inherent in office visits for certain specialties). cms also proposes to more accurately distinguish short-term, rehabilitation-related evaluation and management services provided in nursing facilities from ongoing primary care services furnished to longer-term nursing facility residents.  cms would identify the former services by linking the appropriate cpt codes to nursing facility claims for the same dates of service rather than relying on the place of service code for snfs (code 31) as listed on the professional claim.  southeastern health partners supports the changes as proposed and agrees with cms that linking snf facility claims by date of service to professional claims will better identify short-term, rehabilitation-focused care that should not be counted as primary care services that contribute to beneficiary assignment to acos. in closing, we appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on the medicare shared savings program pathways to success proposed rule.  if you have questions regarding our comments or need additional information,

verma:\n the next generation accountable care organization (aco) coalition writes to provide comments on the medicare shared savings program (mssp) proposed rule.  the coalition represents 33 participants in the next generation aco program who are committed to the future of two-sided risk models to create value in medicare and improve patient care and outcomes.  while many organizations across the country continue to plan and prepare to move into higher levels of risk, our members are at the forefront of meaningful delivery system reform.  the next gen acos are already successfully taking financial and clinical accountability for their patient populations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 generally across multiple lines of business such as ma, commercial risk, medicaid risk, programs for duals and of course medicare aco risk - with significant results in better care for their patients and savings for the federal government.\n the next gen aco participants have already shown that performance-based risk can transform care delivery.  a recent report by norc at the university of chicago for the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) highlighted the next gen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s widespread use of care management, chronic disease management and clinical programs, as well as an enhanced focus on primary care.  in addition, the administration touted $61 million in savings in the first year of the program across 18 model participants.  the next gen program has tremendous potential to continue to build on its early achievements, and we believe that other organizations can learn from this experience and also succeed in two- sided risk models.\n consistent with our commitment to the success of risk-bearing programs in traditional medicare, we provide the below guiding principles for your consideration as you finalize the mssp program rules.\n\n\n\n\nwww.nextgenaco.com \n 1) continue to incentivize the move to higher levels of risk. we are encouraged to see that through this rule, the administration is advancing opportunities in two-sided risk acos through this proposed rule.  we have seen firsthand the type of care transformation that is possible when organizations participate in performance-based risk to improve population health.  we are also pleased with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to waiving and modifying burdensome program rules for organizations that are engaged in increasing levels of financial risk.  examples in this rule include the beneficiary incentive program, telehealth wavier and the skilled nursing facility three-day stay waiver, all of which will apply to certain organizations engaged in two-sided financial models.  this flexibility will be key to encouraging the move to performance-based risk.\n however, we believe that more can be done to facilitate the transition.  as you finalize this rule and consider additional models in the future, we encourage the agency to work with organizations engaged in two-sided risk models across medicare (hmo & ppo), medicaid and commercial populations to identify other regulatory barriers that can be removed to further encourage the transition to higher levels of accountability.  we believe that greater program flexibility should be available to organizations taking on higher levels of risk \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that additional incentives should be created that are available to organizations at higher levels of risk than for those at lower levels of risk.\n 2) create consistency across programs. we respectfully request that cms continue to identify areas within the rules where the agency can create consistency across different medicare aco programs and even more broadly across the delivery system reform portfolio, including in medicare advantage. there may be some areas of program differentiation that remain important, such as differences that incentivize higher levels of risk-taking.  however, we note that there remain a number of areas from beneficiary attribution to payment methodology that differ substantially across the different programs. this is an issue for organizations advancing risk across multiple payment models and looking for greater predictability, transparency and simplicity.   we would welcome the opportunity to work with the agency to identify and evaluate where these programs differ and where harmonizing rules could benefit providers, patients and payers.\n\nwww.nextgenaco.com \n methodology and we would welcome the opportunity to work to develop an approach that incorporates lessons learned from mssp and the medicare advantage program.\n 4) create permanence for the next gen program. as cms considers and further develops the glide path to risk, we recommend that the agency create a voluntary, permanent aco option that incorporates the features of the ngaco model.  the next gen program participants have shown success with higher levels of two-sided risk and have made investments to bring delivery system changes to their local communities.  permanence would bring greater stability and predictability to our efforts.  in addition, a permanent model could serve to provide additional direction and goals for providers entering the mssp today.  we also note that a voluntary, permanent next gen-like offering could provide an opportunity to reduce administrative burden for next gens by streamlining program requirements.\n in conclusion, we appreciate your commitment to performance-based risk and creating a glide path for organizations to move to higher levels of risk. our organizations have seen the success of these models and we look forward to continuing to work with cms to advance better care for patients, providers and payers across traditional medicare. please do not hesitate to contact mara mcdermott (mara@nextgencoalition.org) if you have any questions about these comments.\n\n sincerely,\n\n\n\n mara mcdermott\n\n\n\n",

as written, including: 1.the shortened time period for acos to be in shared savings only mode; 2. the reduce shared savings rate from 50% to 25%\r\n3. the risk adjustment cap being limited to 3 percent over 5 years\r\nthe rule allows too little time for an aco to be in the shared savings only mode. we believe the upside only risk period should be up to five years, with at least three years guaranteed. an aco should also be able to earn an additional two years of upside risk only based on performance.\r\nthe initial three year period would allow new acos one year for planning and two years of operational experience. our position of at least three years of upside risk only is supported by the september 21st health affairs blog post by mark mcclellan and his associates. they note that evidence demonstrates that that organizations more likely need three years of only upside risk before an aco surpasses the learning curve. https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180920.604462/full/\r\nfurther, two years aligns with robert mechanics suggestions in his september 11th health affairs blog entry (https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180906.711463/full/. he recommends that acos should have an opportunity for an additional two years of upside risk only if they meet specified savings and quality goals during the first three years.\r\nsecond, the shared savings rate should remain at 50%. the 25% savings rate does not reflect the need for new aco entrants to be able to recoup their investment costs. as robert mechanic notes in his september 11th health affairs blog analysis running an aco requires new clinical and administrative personnel, data systems and analytics and investment in developing new clinical protocols and workflows. all of this work comes at a cost that the aco bears entirely. these costs provided by the aco are actually a form of risk sharing by the aco.\r\nfinally, cms should raise the hcc risk adjustment cap to at least 5% over 5 years. the proposed rule has an aggregate 3% limit over five years in recognizing changes in beneficiaries risk scores when calculating benchmarks. this rate is the same as it was when agreements were three years in length, not the five year length recommended in the rule. this longer agreement time period comes with a greater likelihood that the health of beneficiaries will change simply as a result of the aging process. therefore, with the increase in the agreement period should come a higher limit for changes in risk scores, allowing risk scores to vary by up to at least 5 percent.\r\nosuwmc is excited to be participating in the mssp aco program. recent studies demonstrate current mssp acos are creating both direct and indirect savings. these acos are the type of market place innovations that are at the core of secretary azars vision.\r\nwhile we support having mssp acos take on more risk

administrator verma,\n on behalf of the american college of physicians (acp), i am pleased to share our comments on the centers for medicare and medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099) proposed rule medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success, as published in the federal register on august 17, 2018. the college is the largest medical specialty organization and the second-largest physician group in the united states. acp members include 154,000 internal medicine physicians (internists), related subspecialists, and medical students. internal medicine physicians are specialists who apply scientific knowledge and clinical expertise to the diagnosis, treatment, and compassionate care of adults across the spectrum from health to complex illness.\n the college has been an ardent support of the medicare shared savings program (mssp) since its inception because we feel it serves a vital role in the transition to value-based reimbursement. we appreciate the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ongoing work to continue to make modifications to improve the design of the program and ensure its viability into the future; goals that acp shares. we appreciate the opportunity to offer comments in response to this proposed rule. we make the following recommendations in the hopes of helping the mssp to continue to grow and attract new accountable care organizations (acos), better coordinate care and recognize efficiencies to control costs and produce savings for participating acos and medicare alike, and above all else improve patient care for the medicare beneficiaries these acos serve.\n\n\n\n\n 2\n summary of key recommendations:\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 limited time in one-sided risk \u00e2\u0080\u0093 acp strongly supports the need to create a glide path of more incremental increases in risk but firmly opposes strict limits on the length of time acos may remain at each level of risk provided they are meeting quality and financial performance standards. two years is not a sufficient amount of time for acos to give new acos in one-sided risk. cms should give acos an opportunity to leverage this new glide path and voluntarily accept more risk. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 sharing rates - the proposed shared savings rates are insufficient to warrant the level of risk and would result in a mass exodus from the program. acp strongly opposes any reduction in the sharing rates below 50%, which has proven profitable. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 agreement period - acp strongly supports increasing the length of agreement periods from three years to five years because it would give acos more time to gain experience and implement redesigned care processes and increase predictability. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 advanced payment opportunities - acp urges cms to reinstate advanced payment opportunities, which provide critical support particularly for small and rural acos. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 regional trend factors - acp supports incorporating regional expenditures into benchmarks earlier but does not support capping it nor reducing its weight relative to the national trend factor. to improve accuracy, cms should remove an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own beneficiaries from the regional beneficiary population to which it is being compared. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 risk adjustment - acp strongly supports accounting for negative changes in health status among continuously assigned beneficiaries but strongly opposes artificially capping risk adjustment without further study, particularly at 3% as proposed. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 july 1, 2019 start date - it is important to give new acos an opportunity to join the mssp in 2019, but the college has several logistical concerns about a mid-year start date, particularly proposals to evaluate cost and quality performance based on a full year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth of data. acp recommends allowing acos whose agreements expire in 2018 to extend up to a full year to minimize disruption. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 beneficiary assignment - acp strongly supports proposals to allow acos to annually select their beneficiary assignment mechanism. giving acos more control over patient assignment increases predictability in their ability to control assigned patient costs and outcomes and therefore builds confidence in accepting more risk.\n detailed recommendations:\n introduction:\n the college agrees with cms that mssp acos are a critical component of the transition to value-based payment reform. to date, the mssp is the largest by far of any of the advanced alternative payment models (apms), with 377,515 participating clinicians in 561 acos that collectively care for 10.5 million medicare beneficiaries. therefore, its ongoing success is intrinsically tied to the success of the value-based payment movement as a whole. by a similar token, approximately 82% of mssp acos are in track 1, 43% of which are currently in their second agreement period, and the significant proportion of the program they comprise should be heavily weighted when it comes to considering any dramatic program changes, including those proposed in this rule.\n 3\n because this model is voluntary, to ensure its continued viability, it is absolutely paramount that cms must balance the need to protect medicare trust fund dollars with the need to create a viable business model that will attract individual acos to participate, which we recognize is a delicate but important balance. we could not agree more with cms that to this point, steep increases in risk level between the various tracks have prevented acos from progressing to higher levels of risk, and that by creating more of a graduated glide path to higher levels of risk, cms will support acos progressing to higher risk models. we also agree that eliminating some of the differences between the tracks including risk adjustment and beneficiary assignment methodologies and allowing acos to advance to higher levels of risk within their current agreement period will facilitate acos advancing to higher risk models at a quicker pace.\n however, we strongly disagree that forcing acos into risk-bearing models after just two years would be an effective way to motivate more acos to take on more risk sooner. to the contrary, we think this would be likely to have damaging consequences on participation in the program. moreover, we feel that proposals to simultaneously drastically reduce the sharing rates would further hinder participation in the program, to the detriment of the medicare trust funds.\n cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal with this program is to improve patient care while generating savings to the medicare trust funds. in this letter, we describe an alternative policy design that we feel better encapsulates both goals while ensuring the future viability and growth of the mssp. in short, we recommend cms address concerns about protecting the medicare trust funds at the individual aco level by requiring all acos perform within the risk corridor (above the minimum loss rate) and meet quality targets in order to continue into a second and subsequent agreement periods. that way, cms is protected from individual acos that remain in the program despite generating losses year after year without having to reduce sharing rates or limiting the time acos may remain in one-sided models across the board, averting a likely mass exodus from the program. by instead focusing on establishing a more gradual \u00e2\u0080\u009cglide path\u00e2\u0080\u009d to increasing risk incentivized by corresponding increases in reward and eliminating unnecessary design differences between the various levels, acos will voluntarily move into more aggressive risk tracks without being forced, as evidenced by early interest in track 1+. moreover, by improving risk-adjustment, benchmarking and patient assignment methodologies, cms will improve accuracy and participant confidence in program metrics and invite wider participation, which means improving care for more medicare beneficiaries and generating more savings for medicare.\n limited time in one-sided risk\n 4\n greater detail later in this letter. acos with previous experience would be required to enter the enhanced track or the highest level of risk and reward in the basic track (level e). low-revenue acos would be allowed up to two agreement terms in the basic track, but high-revenue acos would be expected to move to the advanced track by their second agreement period. proposals concerning high-revenue acos and acos with previous experience are separately discussed in later sections.\n the college agrees that creating a suitable glide path to higher levels of risk is necessary to make more acos comfortable taking on risk. however, cms should not impose strict time limits on the amount of time acos can remain at each level of risk. in any case, two years is not a sufficient amount of time for acos in one-sided risk. past performance data shows it is common for acos to start generating savings in their third or fourth performance year after gaining experience in the program and allowing time for savings to generate from care delivery reforms. forcing acos into levels of risk before this point will result in massive drop-offs in participation, particularly among small and rural acos, and will cause cms to miss out on savings that may have been generated by these same acos in later performance years. acp urges cms to instead offer acos proper incentives to advance to higher levels of risk, which will achieve cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal of enticing more acos to move into higher levels of risk without risking upending its flagship advanced apm.  acos will voluntarily advance to higher levels of risk if provided proper incentives, as proven by early interest in track 1+. moreover, based on cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposals to eliminate unnecessary distinctions between the various tracks and levels, and our assertion that there is sufficient incentive for acos to voluntarily advance to higher levels of risk, acp believes that the distinction between the basic and advanced tracks is unwarranted and adds unnecessary complexity. we would instead recommend cms create a unified program with separate tracks that differ simply in the level of risk and reward that they offer. as detailed in our recommendations for sharing rates, the sharing rate should be set at a minimum of 50% for all levels, including one-sided models. from there, cms should create a series of consistent, gradual increases in both risk and reward, rather than a few inflection points to significantly different levels of risk. this is especially needed between what would be level e in the basic track and the advanced track. this will both create a smooth glide path to higher levels of risk and reduce complexity within the program.\n 5\n cms notes that a major deterrent to electing high risk tracks to date has been a lack of a glide path, adding that the magnitude of potential losses in tracks 2 or 3 is \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery high\u00e2\u0080\u009d and likely \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant issue\u00e2\u0080\u009d that contributes to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reluctance to participate in these tracks. acp too is confident that low uptake of tracks 2 and 3 is largely due to the lack of a gradual pathway that allows acos to build confidence in taking on more risk. this is supported by the overwhelming interest to participate in the new track 1+ model. in the first year it was offered, 55 acos started participation agreements, instantly more than doubling participation in performance-based risk models. this suggests that it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the lack of interest in two-sided risk models, but rather a lack of models that offered graduated levels of risk that prevented many acos from taking the leap from no risk to significant levels of risk. cms agrees that availability of a lower-risk, two-sided model \u00e2\u0080\u009cis effective to encourage a large cohort of acos to rapidly progress to performance-based risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cms explains that a large driver behind its proposed reorganization of the program are financial and quality results to date that prove \u00e2\u0080\u009cacos in two-sided risk models generally perform better than acos that participate under a one-sided risk model.\u00e2\u0080\u009d however, the opposite is true. in 2017, 433 track 1 acos saved an average of $47 per beneficiary, 36% more than track 2 or 3 acos. in aggregate, track 1 acos generated more than 12 times the net savings as track 2 and 3 acos combined, even after accounting for shared savings payouts ($290 million versus $23 million), thanks in large part to the heavy volume of mssp acos in track 1. no matter how you look at it, one-sided acos are saving medicare money, and at larger rates on both a per-beneficiary and aggregate basis than their two- sided counterparts. moreover, this program was profitable to medicare even after generating over $800 million in shared savings bonuses to acos, which will be reinvested back into infrastructure and new value-based innovations that improve patient care, a triple win for medicare, aco participants, and patients alike. not only does this prove that track 1 acos already have more than sufficient motivation to save money, it proves that forcing acos out of this profitable model after two years could cost medicare money.\n the proposed two-year mark at which acos would be required to take on risk is all-the- more concerning given the fact that cms agrees that acos improve over their tenure in the program because they \u00e2\u0080\u009cneed time to understand performance, gain experience and implement redesigned care processes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d additionally, value-based reforms, including a larger focus on preemptive, high-value services, a more team-based approach to care coordination, and a wider variety of patient-centered spectrum of services do result in savings, but this takes years to capture. under these new proposals, acos would be forced to move to risk before positive changes would be realized. according to independent analyses, 1 slight savings in per beneficiary spending generally do not accrue until the third performance year, and substantial savings not until the fourth performance year. 2017 mssp performance data mirrors this trend; 2017 and 2016 starters each yielded $34 million in total losses, 2015 starters yielded a slight aggregate savings of $5 million, while 2014 and 2012/2013 starters netted a rather substantial $173 and $205 million profit respectively, suggesting once again that if given sufficient time, the mssp can be profitable even with a strong presence of acos in one-sided risk tracks.\n\n 6\n in its regulatory impact analysis, cms makes the assumption that the proposed basic track would \u00e2\u0080\u009cincrease participation in performance-based risk by acos that may not otherwise take on the higher exposure to risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the contrary, studies prove that it is much more likely that after just two years, acos that do not feel comfortable with risk will drop out of the program, particularly if coupled with proposed changes to have them be financially accountable for shared losses even if they drop out before the end of a performance year. a may 2018 naacos survey found that more than seven in ten acos would consider dropping out of the program if forced into higher levels of risk.2 cms acknowledges as much in the regulatory impact analysis when it says that the proposed faster transition to performance-based risk \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan affect broader participation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n one-sided risk models create an important on-ramp for a broad spectrum of clinicians and suppliers who have not participated in a value-based initiative before, but are especially critical to making the model accessible to and attract small, rural, safety net, and/or physician-only acos, which cms acknowledges. these types of acos are especially challenged by the upfront costs to forming and operating acos and have a much more limited ability to take on financial risk without risking the viability of their ability to stay in practice. accordingly, forcing these types of acos to take on risk after only two years in the program would disproportionately impact the ability of small, rural, safety net, and physician-owned acos that are able to continue participating in the program. often, these types of acos have the strongest ability to curb spending and improve quality so finalizing these proposals could hinder success of the mssp as a whole, as well as be a lost opportunity to improve care for thousands of medicare beneficiaries, particularly in rural areas. of note, four out of every ten acos in track 1+ were likely comprised of independent physician practices and/or acos that include small rural hospitals, proving that these types of acos will progress to two-sided models, but that they cannot practically weather higher levels of risk to the same extent that their larger counterparts may be able to, and forcing them to do so may give many small and rural acos no other choice but to exit the program.\n the college strongly supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow eligible acos the option to elect entry into a higher level of risk and potential reward for each performance year within their agreement period. this is a win-win, both allowing cms to achieve its goal of shifting more acos into higher levels of risk and giving acos more flexibility and would be particularly impactful if cms finalizes its policy to extend the benchmark period from three to five years. the college has previously called on cms to allow acos to progress to higher levels of risk within their agreement period and are pleased to see this proposal.\n sharing rates\n cms proposes to reduce overall sharing rates for savings earned, particularly for one-sided and lower risk models. the potential shared savings rate for one-sided risk models would be cut in half, from 50% to 25%. acos in the basic track would gradually move along a continuum of increasingly higher levels of risk and reward before capping out at a maximum 50% shared savings rate (depending on quality performance) with a minimum shared losses rate that is tied to the minimum advanced apm nominal amount standard.\n 7\n the enhanced track which would feature a shared savings rate of up to a 75% and an inverse shared losses rate that could range from 40% to 75%. the proposed sharing rates for acos in the basic and enhanced tracks are displayed below.\n current:\n track 1 track 1+ track 2 track 3 shared savings up to 50% up to 50% up to 60% up to 75% shared losses n/a 30% 30% choice of symmetrical msr/mlr: (i) 0%; (ii) 0.5% increments between 0.5% -\n2.0%; (iii) varies based on # \n of assigned beneficiaries\n proposed:\n basic levels a/b basic level c basic level d basic level e enhanced shared savings up to 25% up to 30% up to 40% up to 50% up to 75% shared losses n/a 30%, not to exceed 2% of revenue or 1% of benchmark 30%, not to exceed 4% of revenue or 2% of benchmark 30%, not to exceed aapm risk standard 1- sharing rate 40% - 70% not to exceed 15% of benchmark\n the college finds that the proposed shared savings rates are insufficient to warrant the corresponding level of risk and would result in a massive decline in participation if finalized. positively encouraging acos to take on more risk by offering higher prospects for reward is a much more effective strategy for the future viability and growth of this voluntary model than reducing incentives to participate in lower risk models. cms acknowledges that the model must have an appealing \u00e2\u0080\u009cvalue proposition\u00e2\u0080\u009d and provide \u00e2\u0080\u009csufficient incentives\u00e2\u0080\u009d for acos to volunteer to accept risk. perhaps no element is more critical to the value proposition than the sharing rate. a 2016 naacos study found that the average operating costs for acos was well over $1.5 million, nearly $2 million for single acos (as opposed to multi-acos). to justify the substantial financial risk and major cultural shift inherent to starting an aco, the prospect for a return on investment must be there. there is no question that lowering the sharing rate, much less cutting it in half, will exponentially diminish existing and future participation in the program. cms still benefits from every dollar in shared savings achieved regardless of the sharing rate, but higher sharing rates would attract a much larger participant pool, which will produce more savings for cms.\n 8\n balance of incentivizing hundreds of acos to participate, while still remaining profitable for cms, and should not be lowered.  in particular, cutting the sharing rate in half to 25% for one-sided acos will turn many new acos from participation given the substantial upfront costs.\n higher savings rates also directly benefits patient care. acos are using the money earned by these shared savings payments to reinvest in value-based based and patient- centered innovations that will benefit patients at the ground level.\n minimum savings rate (msr), minimum loss rate (mlr), and loss sharing limits\n cms proposes to continue existing policies for setting the msr and mlr (the dollar figure at which acos begin sharing in savings or losses based on financial performance relative to their benchmarks), including a variable msr based on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number of assigned beneficiaries for one-sided risk tracks and a variable, symmetrical msr methodology for two-sided risk tracks.\n acp supports continuing to allow acos in risk-bearing tracks to select their minimum savings rate (msr) and minimum loss rate (mlr) because it provides them with the flexibility and autonomy that is critical to building confidence in accepting higher levels of risk. due to the symmetrical nature of the msr and mlr, the medicare trust funds would also be protected. there is a benefit to maintaining some consistency in current requirements with aco participants already have familiarity, as well as consistency between the various two-sided tracks to both reduce complexity and facilitate a more seamless progression to higher risk models. the college does not believe that allowing acos to select their msr/mlr prior to the start of each performance year would lead to gaming. performance varies significantly for each aco from year to year and is hardly predictable due to substantial churn in both assigned beneficiaries and participating practices, evolving benchmarking and risk-adjustment policies, a steep learning curve, and a host of other factors, particularly in an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early years of the program. moreover, performance data is not released until typically six months after a performance year concludes, so acos would have a limited practical ability to game the system up to two years after the fact, at which point past experience proves that performance is likely to have improved considerably.\n the college additionally recommends cms build rewards for outstanding quality performance into sharing rates. as it stands, acos can have their msr and mlr negatively impacted by quality performance that falls below certain standards, but they are not rewarded for superior quality performance. we ask that cms establish a system where msrs would increase and mlrs would decrease based on superior performance on quality measures, which would provide further incentive for acos to invest in high value services to further improve patient quality outcomes.\n 9\n\n forced termination of acos with poor performance\n cms proposes a number of new program integrity provisions, including regularly monitoring for financial performance and permitting the forced termination of acos with multiple years of poor financial performance.\n acp believes enforcing program integrity at an individual aco level by expecting acos to meet quality and financial performance expectations in order to continue in the program would be more appropriate and effective than forcing all acos along a continuum of increasing risk. however, it is critical cms allow acos sufficient time to gain experience in the program before being liable for termination. accordingly, acp offers the following specific recommendations. acos should be protected from possible termination for one full agreement period. however, acos that generate losses beyond their mlr and/or fail to meet quality expectations by the end of their third performance year could be required to submit and implement a corrective action plan for their fourth performance year. then, as a condition of being approved for a second or subsequent agreement period, acos could be expected to meet quality standards and operate within the risk corridor (not generate savings below the mlr).\n we believe this timeframe is appropriate given earlier cited findings that acos tend to not reach significant savings until their fourth and fifth performance years. in the rule, cms also notes that of the 14 track 1 acos that started in 2012/2013 and were negative outside the corridor for their first two consecutive performance years, only one was negative outside the corridor in 2016 and together they yielded a net savings. this supports the notion that given time, the majority of acos that continue participating have the desire and capacity to succeed and it is to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benefit to give them that opportunity. our approach balances this need to give acos adequate time to adjust to program requirements and expectations while holding acos accountable for cost and quality performance and protecting the integrity of the mssp and medicare trust funds.\n availability of advance payment funds\n despite previously acknowledging in past rulemaking that acos must make significant upfront investments in enhanced services and care management infrastructure, cms does not propose in this rule to reinstate any advance funding opportunities for new acos.\n 10\n\n extending length of agreement period to five years\n acp strongly supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to increase the length of agreement periods from three to five years. longer agreement periods give acos more time to understand their performance, gain experience, and implement redesigned care processes before their benchmarks are rebased, which allows more time for improved quality and financial outcomes to be realized from care process improvements. this contributes to greater predictability of benchmarks and therefore builds aco confidence and increase their ability and propensity to take on risk, which is also a win for cms.\n distinguishing between low-revenue and high-revenue acos\n cms explains in the proposed rule that it believes \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh-revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos \u00e2\u0080\u009chave a greater opportunity to control expenditures\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and have the potential to perform better\u00e2\u0080\u009d than they do currently. as added incentive to boost performance, cms proposes to limit high-revenue acos to one performance period in the basic track before being required to advance to the enhanced track. low-revenue acos would be allowed to continue in the basic track at the highest level of risk (level e) for a second agreement period. cms proposes to define high-revenue acos as those whose total medicare parts a and b fee for service revenue for their participant tax identification numbers (tins) is at least 25% of total parts a and b total expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries.\n given the college\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal that all acos should be permitted to remain in each track for an indeterminate amount of time and gradually advance to higher levels of risk, the distinction between \u00e2\u0080\u009clow\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d revenue acos would not be necessary. however, acp does have concerns with this distinction between \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh-revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-revenue\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos as described by cms.  while we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 intent to provide \u00e2\u0080\u009clow revenue acos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which tend to be smaller or rural acos, with risk track options that are more consistent with their ability to take on risk, the college is concerned that the way cms proposes to distinguish high-revenue acos is not appropriate because it would be confusing, operationally burdensome, and most importantly, result in unintended consequences.\n 11\n to the program simultaneously, and should instead wait and see if adjustments to benchmarking, risk adjustment, and other design elements help to address other discrepancies, such as high-revenue acos traditionally not performing as well.\n acp has concerns about the methodology cms used to arrive at the 25% figure, which appears to be more a line drawn in the sand than a significant inflection point of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to control costs. 25% of expenditures hardly signifies a significant ability to control costs. there is also no accounting for a number of factors beyond the control of acos that could artificially inflate this number. for example, infusion drugs, are expensive to medicare but are a set price with little to no opportunity to reduce spending. acos should not be penalized for providing critical services like these and others, or worse, to be perversely incentivized not to administer them to patients.\n executing this policy would be operationally difficult and create unnecessary complexity in the program. as cms itself acknowledges, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit would be difficult for acos to determine at the time of application submission whether they would be identified as a low-revenue or high- revenue aco.\u00e2\u0080\u009d additionally, cms would have to consistently monitor to ensure aco participant changes did not alter an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s status as a low-revenue or high-revenue aco and for those that did, the agency would have to issue correction notices and require corrective action plans\u00e2\u0080\u0094more unnecessary complication and burden on both acos and\ncms.  \n\n the college recommends cms instead adopt its alternate proposal to give small, rural, and/or physician-led acos opportunities for increased savings through a lower msr or higher shared savings rate. given the voluntary nature of the program, positive incentives for participation will be a much more effective long-term strategy than making the program more stringent for particular subclasses of acos. this approach would also more directly achieve the results cms wants and would be far easier to monitor. these types of acos face unique challenges to participation in apms, including a more limited financial reserves, and additional flexibilities including but not limited to lower-risk options would encourage small, rural, and physician-led acos to participate in the program. low-revenue acos have typically outperformed high-revenue acos, so their ongoing participation is particularly critical to the financial success of the program. additionally, these types of acos often serve underserved patient populations so their participation in the program would have a particularly profound impact on patient outcomes and quality of care. the college would strongly support either of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposals to offer these acos either a lower msr or higher shared savings rate. based on feedback from our members, we feel that lowering the msr would be more persuasive in motivating more low-revenue acos to participate.\n experienced and reentering acos\n 12\n the enhanced track. reentering acos would be those that reenter the program after a break in participation. new legal entities in which 50% or more of participants most recently participated in the same aco would be considered reentering acos and eligibility to participate on the basic track would be based on participation of this original entity.\n based on acp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earlier recommendation to allow acos to remain in a particular track for an unspecified duration of time, the need for distinctions between experienced and reentering acos would be eliminated. however, should cms advance these proposals, acp recommends at a minimum, cms set a higher threshold to designate experienced acos and restrict the definition of an experienced aco to those with prior experience specifically in the mssp. setting the threshold for experienced acos at 40% and the threshold for reentering aco entities at 50% is confusing. in addition, 40% leaves a majority of participants who would have no prior experience with this type of model and would require more time to familiarize themselves with program requirements and the type of system reforms inherent to participating in a population-based apm. moreover, the rules of every individual apm are complex and can vary significantly from model to model, so the definition of an \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d aco in this model should be limited to experience in the mssp. cms acknowledges that an aco \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay need time to gain experience with the [mssp]\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies\u00e2\u0080\u009d even if it previously participated in another medicare aco initiative.\n acp agrees there is sound reasoning in establishing a clear definition for initial entrants, renewing acos (including acos immediately enter a new agreement period after terminating), and reentering acos to protect against program integrity concerns. we believe a five-year lookback period would be appropriate if the benchmark is extended to five years as proposed. the college also appreciates and supports the clarification that the 50% threshold would not be cumulative based on experience in any aco over the past five years, but rather, based on 50% or more participants most recently participating in the same aco. we agree this will serve cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal of identifying acos with \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant participant overlap\u00e2\u0080\u009d while minimizing complexity that could easily arise from using other methods and therefore improve transparency.\n the college takes issue with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 characterization that acos would invest substantial upfront start-up costs and undergo a major organizational shift or undergo the burdensome process of dissolving and re-forming under a different legal entity, much less voluntarily subject itself to shared losses, simply to \u00e2\u0080\u009cgame\u00e2\u0080\u009d the system. the number of acos that drop out of the program after sustaining losses should prove that waivers for certain service billing requirements or fraud and abuse restrictions is not enough to warrant continued participation in the program without the prospect of earning shared savings. however, we appreciate the importance of program integrity and understand that particularly if cms elects to move forward with proposals to shorten the time an aco may remain in a one-sided risk track and extend the contract term to five years which affects how often benchmarks are rebased, the incentives to participate in \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaming\u00e2\u0080\u009d could rise, therefore certain, well-defined precautionary measures may be warranted.\n 13\n would no longer be necessary to protect program integrity given these new definitions and rules for returning acos and if left in place, would only service to diminish participation in the program and restrict the ability of acos in current agreement periods to transition to the proposed participation options under new agreements.\n benchmarks changes\n to improve the accuracy of financial benchmarks, cms proposes to make several refinements to the methodology regarding the proportion of national verses regional trend factors. specifically, the agency proposes to begin phasing in regional fee-for-service (ffs) expenditures during an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first agreement period, rather than waiting to second and subsequent agreement periods. however, cms proposes to minimize the impact of regional adjustments overall by reducing the maximum weight of the regional adjustment from 70% to 50% and capping the regional adjustment amount to 5% of national medicare fee-for- service per capita expenditures. cms also proposes to increase the weight of national trend factors relative to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s penetration in the regional service area in an attempt to prevent acos from being too positively or negatively impacted by changes to its own beneficiary population when trending benchmarks based on regional spending.\n acp supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to incorporate regional expenditures into the benchmarking methodology for acos earlier, in the first agreement period. the college appreciates cms being receptive to past comments by acp and many other stakeholders to incorporate regional expenditures into financial benchmarks because they capture trends specific to the regional service market and are more accurate than benchmarks based solely on national ffs spending. incorporating regional trend factors also allows cms to more accurately capture the impact of the regional population\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health status and socioeconomic factors. given that in 2017, 80% of acos receiving a rebased benchmark benefitted from receiving a regional adjustment, it is no surprise that aco performance has continuously improved to the point where the program generated a net savings for the first time.\n 14\n\n to improve the accuracy of regional benchmarking, acp reiterates our past recommendation that the agency remove an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own beneficiaries from the regional comparison pool against which it is being evaluated. while we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concern about small sample sizes, comparing an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population against itself is no way to conduct a difference of difference analysis. it would be more statistically accurate to compare the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population against a small population that is not tainted with its own beneficiaries to isolate the effect that the aco is having on its own beneficiaries versus the regional market as a control group. the proposed alternative of varying the proportion of national and regional trend factors based on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size relative to its regional population would be operationally difficult, lack transparency, would not be budget-neutral on a national scale, and most importantly, it would not solve the problem it is intending to address. it would be inequitable to differ benchmarks in this way and the policy would disproportionally impact rural acos which are more likely to comprise a large share of their regional beneficiary population. these acos would be held accountable to national trend factors that cms admits itself are less accurate than regional trend factors and accordingly, benchmarks would not adequately recognize the impact they make in their beneficiary populations relative to their regional markets, rendering them less likely to generate shared savings and disproportionately more likely to drop out of the program.\n acp urges cms to exclude merit-based incentive payment system (mips) bonuses as aco expenditures when calculating benchmarks. cms currently excludes advanced apm bonuses from aco expenditures and we reiterate our request for cms do the same for mips expenditures. this will be increasingly important over time as mips bonuses are projected to rise in future program years and will count against the aco when assessing performance relative to the benchmark. the better an aco performs in mips, the greater they will be penalized when calculating shared savings/losses for the aco, undermining one of the founding principles of the mssp to incentivize high-value care.\n risk adjustment\n cms proposes to allow risk adjustments to reflect positive, as well as negative changes in the health status of continuous, assigned beneficiaries over the length of an agreement period. however, the agency proposes to cap the total adjustment to 3% over the course of an agreement period.\n acp strongly supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to account for both positive and negative changes in health status among continuously assigned beneficiaries over the course of an agreement period. this will help to ensure acos are not negatively impacted by natural changes in a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health status over time and give acos more confidence to move into higher levels of risk. we appreciate cms being receptive to past concerns raised by stakeholders including acp that the current risk adjustment methodology does not adequately adjust for changes in health status among continuously assigned beneficiaries.\n 15\n performance year in the proposed agreement period. properly risk adjusting is critical to avert patient cherry picking and to assure acos that they will not be negatively impacted for changes in health acuity that are out of their control, thus giving them the confidence to take on more risk.  the 3% cap would be especially concerning if cms finalizes plans to extend the agreement period to five years, which acp supports. any cap should be intended to capture strictly outliers, not nearly one-third of acos as cms estimates the proposed 3% cap would. the proposed 3% cap is far too low and should not be finalized.\n july 1, 2019 start date\n given the timing of this proposed rule, cms does not expect acos would be able to reasonably apply and implement an aco under new rules starting jan. 1, 2019. therefore, the agency proposes a one-time start date of july 1, 2019 for new agreements under the new policies proposed in this rule. acos that apply for this start date would have an initial agreement period of 5.5 years. to prevent disruption, current acos would be able to complete the remainder of their current agreement under existing model rules and requirements. for acos agreements that expire at the end of 2018, acos would have an opportunity to extend their current agreement periods for an additional six months under current program rules and apply for a july 1, 2019 start date under new rules. the usual annual application cycle would resume on jan. 1, 2020 and in future performance years.\n while acp believes it is important to give new acos an opportunity to join the mssp in 2019, we have several logistical concerns about a mid-year start date that would need to be resolved, particularly regarding cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to evaluate cost and quality performance based on a full year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth of data and prorate it based on the number of months of active participation. acp agrees that unfortunately due to the timing of the release of this rule, a jan. 1, 2019 start date would be difficult. we appreciate cms recognizing that acos will need time to consider new participation options, prepare for program changes, make any investment, repayment, and restructuring decisions, obtain buy-in from their governing bodies and executives, and complete and submit applications. however, we agree that it is important not to completely forego an opportunity to join the mssp in 2019. additionally, given the timing of qualified participant (qp) snapshot calculations, july 1 is the final date an apm can begin in order for its participants to qualify for qp status in an advanced apm for that performance year, which we also agree is an important consideration. accordingly, a july 1, 2019 start date could an appropriate option for new acos. however, there are several logistical concerns regarding the proposed six month performance periods in 2019 that would need to be resolved and may be difficult to finalize in such a short timeframe, particularly with sufficient stakeholder feedback. moreover, changing program rules midyear would create unnecessary confusion during what would already be a major period of transition for this program.\n 16\n\n the college also urges cms to give acos the option to combine data from the abbreviated 2019 reporting periods with 2020 performance data to provide for a longer, 18-month performance period. longer performance periods yield more predictable and accurate outcomes. this added stabilization would be particularly helpful for the first six-months under new program rules and could entice more acos to apply. acos tend to take multiple years to in the program to gain experience and allow time for positive care transformations to culminate in actual quality and savings results. six months would be an extremely short turn-around for this. moreover, we feel the concerns cms gives for not proposing longer agreement period could be mitigated and that acos should have the option to decide for themselves which tradeoffs to make. for instance, we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concern about delaying shared savings payments, but given the agency also notes it could reconcile 2018 shared savings/losses owed with those during the january \u00e2\u0080\u0093 june 2019 performance period, it does not appear that shared savings payments would be significantly delayed if the six month performance period were absorbed with 2018 data. some acos may prefer to delay shared savings payments for the option of having performance spread out over a longer period of time and should be given the option. regarding cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concern about burdening acos by requiring a longer reimbursement mechanism coverage period, we do not feel this would be substantially prohibitive either if cms finalizes its proposal to allow acos to secure funding in segments.\n reconciling shared savings/losses for acos with less than 12 months of performance\n cms proposes to base financial and quality calculations based on an entire years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of data, and prorate shared savings/losses based on the number of active months, both for acos that voluntarily terminate prior to the end of a 12-month performance year and for all acos that participate in one of the special 2019 six-month performance periods.\n acp has major logistical concerns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed methodologies for basing financial and quality calculations on 12 months of data and prorating shared savings/losses, particularly for acos that would start july 1 under new program rules and urges cms not to move forward with these policies at this time. it remains unclear how cms plans to evaluate an aco based on quality and cost data that predates that aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation in the program, much less even forming, assuming contracts and participations lists will not be solicited, submitted, approved and signed all by january 1. because acos are required to submit aco-specific quality measures through the cms web interface, acos would be expected to collect and report this data from participating tins before participation lists are finalized, which is impractical. while the concerns are not as profound for continuing acos that would participate in a january 1- june 30 contract period, it still raises questions about the realistic expectation for acos to continue reporting quality data on behalf of participating tins after the contract period has ended. our alternative proposal to allow current acos whose contracts are expiring to extend for a full year and new acos that join july 1, 2019 the option to combine 2019 with 2020 data would help to alleviate these logistical concerns, since cms would have more than enough data to analyze without counting data from time outside the actual performance period.\n 17\n regarding acos in traditional 12-month performance periods that voluntarily terminate early, the college understands the logic behind cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to base financial reconciliation for prorated losses based on a full 12 months of data that is then prorated based on the number of months the aco was in the program, because it could incent acos to continue to control expenditure growth, as it could potentially reduce the amount of shared losses owed. however, we have similar concerns regarding expectations for acos to continue reporting quality data on behalf of participating tins after the contract has terminated that would need to be addressed before moving forward with any such policy.\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal not to assess prorated shared losses for acos who voluntarily terminate prior to the end of a six-month performance period in 2019, as imposing an earlier deadline would not allow adequate time for acos to acquire the necessary information to make their participation decision. additionally, this would encourage acos to extend and/or sign a new agreement and continue participating.\n the college supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to shorten the minimum notification of termination period from 60 to 30 days because acos could base this decision on three quarters of feedback reports, as opposed to only two. however, we recommend cms set the deadline for notification at 30 days following the release of the second quarter financial report, rather than june 30, as proposed. the timing of release of data varies year to year, so this approach would better ensure acos have a reasonable window of time to interpret data from their third quarterly report, as cms intends.\n the college calls on cms to apply the same prorated policy to shared savings for acos that voluntarily terminate. while we agree that acos expecting to generate savings will realistically be less likely to terminate in the first place, cms should apply the same policy to shared savings and losses. this consistency helps to ensure program integrity and transparency, while the practical impact would be minimal so the medicare trust funds would be not be at substantial risk.\n repayment mechanisms\n cms proposes several changes to the repayment mechanisms, including using more recent data to calculate repayment mechanism estimates and periodically recalculating the amount of repayment arrangements based on tin or beneficiary population changes. the agency proposes to potentially require acos to demonstrate an ability to pay back a higher amount in the event of a \u00e2\u0080\u009csubstantial\u00e2\u0080\u009d increase, which would be defined as the lesser of 10% or $100,000.\n to lessen the burden of securing repayment mechanism funding for longer periods of time given proposals to increase agreement periods to five years, cms proposes to allow a preliminary four to five year extension to cover the first two or three performance years of the new agreement period plus a 24-month tail period that would be followed by later extensions. cms also proposes to permit early termination of a repayment mechanism and release of the arrangement\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remaining funds to the aco under certain conditions, such as it being determined that the aco does not owe losses.\n 18\n the college supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to use more recent data to calculate repayment mechanism estimates and agree this will help to improve the accuracy of such estimates. we agree it could be appropriate to periodically recalculate the amount of a repayment arrangement based on tin composition or beneficiary population changes and to possibly require the aco to demonstrate an ability to pay back this higher amount but want to emphasize the importance of minimizing burden on acos by limiting such requests to \u00e2\u0080\u009csubstantial\u00e2\u0080\u009d increases and providing acos with adequate notice and time to secure additional funding if necessary. while cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed thresholds of the lesser of 10% or $100,000 seem reasonable, we seek more information about how many acos this would impact before cms finalizes such a policy.\n acp supports allowing a preliminary four to five year extension followed by a later extension to balance the need to protect the integrity of the program while not unnecessarily inhibiting participation. we appreciate cms recognizing that it may be difficult for acos that are completing the term of their current agreement period to extend an existing repayment mechanism by seven years (a five-year agreement term plus 24 months). we agree that achieving a seven-year extension, particularly on top of an existing repayment term, may be prohibitively difficult to secure and therefore threaten to hinder participation in the program among willing acos. we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 preemptive recognition of this potential hardship and willingness to incorporate additional flexibilities to improve the feasibility of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to secure repayment funding resources. the college also supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to permit early termination of a repayment mechanism and release of the arrangement\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remaining funds to the aco under certain conditions, such as it being determined that the aco does not owe losses.\n acp calls on cms to reinstate alternative repayment mechanisms. while we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concern over acos contracting with non-vetted organizations, having this alternative option is an important way to accommodate acos, particularly smaller acos, and facilitate their ability to participate in the program. it is important cms maintain this flexibility and work with those handful of acos on an individual basis to ensure that they have flexible options. while we understand that in some cases this can add administrative complexity, we feel that the number of acos who partake in this option to be minimal so the burden on cms would be limited.\n waivers\n cms proposes to expand several existing waivers related to telehealth service requirements, including waiving certain geographic and site of service requirements, and skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule requirements, including expanding them to acos in two-sided models under prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation and adding more types of eligible snf affiliates. the agency also proposes waivers to allow two- sided models to establish cms-approved beneficiary incentive programs.\n 19\n proposals in this rule and urge the agency to continue to look for additional ways to exercise its wavier authority to reduce barriers to care coordination and high-value services.\n acp strongly supports proposals to allow two-sided models to establish cms- approved beneficiary incentive programs. we would additionally encourage cms to lift certain restrictions including not expecting acos to bear the sole expense and expanding these waivers to one-sided acos. strengthening beneficiary incentives are a critical way to get patients more actively involved in their own care, which results in better health outcomes and smarter spending. moreover, beneficiary incentives can be designed to inherently direct patients to high-value services, such as rewards for fulfilling primary care visits. however, we feel that by proposing such restrictive and burdensome requirements, cms is limiting the effectiveness of such programs. for instance, acos should not be expected to bear the sole expense. cms should consider passing additional waivers for proven cost saving services, such as transportation to patient care visits and reduced or waived copays for primary care visits. cms should consider expanding the beneficiary incentive programs waiver to one-sided acos. because these waivers are already conditional on cms approval, the risk to cms would be minimal and would empower acos to further innovate and improve patient care.\n beneficiary notification and assignment\n cms proposes to give all acos the opportunity to elect between beneficiary assignment methodologies on an annual basis. the assignment methodology that an aco selects in its initial application would remain in effect unless the aco voluntarily elects to change it through an annual election process. cms proposes a \u00e2\u0080\u009chybrid\u00e2\u0080\u009d beneficiary assignment approach which would give acos the option to incorporate voluntary beneficiary alignment to a primary care clinician or opting-into an aco in addition to claims-based assignment.\n cms proposes to use a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designation to supersede claims based assignment even if the beneficiary does not receive primary care services from an aco professional in that aco. moreover, a beneficiary would be assigned to an aco based upon his or her selection of any aco professional, regardless of specialty, as his or her primary clinician.\n cms proposes to provide a template notice with information related to the mssp and patient responsibilities including voluntary assignment and their option to opt out of sharing personal data. the agency would require acos to provide this documentation to aco beneficiaries during their first primary care appointment during each performance year. acos would be banned from advertising any existing beneficiary incentive programs with these materials out of concern that it may \u00e2\u0080\u009cinappropriately steer\u00e2\u0080\u009d beneficiaries to align under a certain aco. acos would be responsible for collecting information related to voluntary patient alignment and submitting it to cms to be updated on an annual basis.\n 20\n counseling, and additional complexity add-on codes for existing primary care service codes proposed in this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medicare physician fee schedule.\n acp has long supported flexible beneficiary assignment policies because it affords acos more flexibility in patient assignment, which is critical to building confidence and predictability in their ability to control patient outcomes and succeed in the program. we appreciate cms being responsive to these concerns raised by acp and other stakeholder groups. creating consistency between the various tracks also allows cms to streamline the program and would make it easier for acos to more quickly and seamlessly transition to higher levels of risk and reward. we additionally support the proposal to allow the assignment methodology indicated on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application to remain in effect for the duration of the agreement period unless an aco voluntarily elects to change it through an annual election process, which maximizes flexibility while minimizing burden on acos.\n acp supports the proposed \u00e2\u0080\u009chybrid\u00e2\u0080\u009d beneficiary assignment approach which entails giving acos the option to incorporate voluntary beneficiary alignment in addition to claims-based assignment. we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concerns that relying solely on voluntary assignment or opting-in, especially in the early years of inception, could lead to small patient populations that do not meet the minimum required 5,000 patient lives and could thus weaken participation in the program, as well as lead to possible cherry picking of patients, and would be premature at this time. giving acos the option to incorporate voluntarily beneficiary assignment and opting-in strikes the right balance of putting patients more at the center of their care without inciting possibly damaging downstream consequences to individual acos and the mssp as a whole.\n the college does not support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to assign a beneficiary to an aco based on their selection of any aco professional, regardless of specialty. at a minimum, patients should not be attributed to a specialist unless he/she has received a minimum quota of primary care service from a professional within the same aco. the policy as proposed would undercut the care coordination and primary care focus that is central to the program.\n 21\n this new option. in 2018, only 4,314 of 12.3 million beneficiaries voluntarily aligned themselves to an aco, a fraction of one percent.\n acp agrees that supplying acos with a template notice could help to minimize burden and we support requiring acos to dispense this information to patients during their first primary care appointment after a tin has joined the aco. however, we recommend that after the initial visit, an oral reminder at subsequent visits supplemented by an automatic email would keep patients sufficiently informed while minimizing burden on acos. additionally, acp urges cms to reconsider its proposed ban on allowing acos to include beneficial additional information, such as available beneficiary incentive programs, along with these notices. acp agrees with cms that patient education about the mssp, their physician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in it, and particularly their own role regarding the options to align with a clinician or opt-into an aco and refuse to share their health data is critical, especially initially. however, requiring primary care clinicians to dispel this information annually is burdensome and would yield little benefit after the initial visit. our proposed alternative approach would reduce burden on practices without sacrificing patient education. while we do not feel it should be required, acos should be permitted to include pertinent information about any beneficiary incentive programs as supplemental materials with this notice. banning this this would inherently undercut the success of such programs and educating patients about the availability of such programs only benefits them. we disagree that informing patients about available benefit programs would \u00e2\u0080\u009cinappropriately steer\u00e2\u0080\u009d beneficiaries; it simply entails providing them with all the information to make an informed decision. these programs do not restrict a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to seek care outside the aco, but may incentivize a beneficiary to receive services within that aco, which minimizes patient churn while providing that patient with services or benefits he/she may not otherwise receive that also improve health outcomes.\n we urge cms to attribute patients on a more frequent, ideally rolling basis, by leveraging its qpp website as a portal that beneficiaries may log into and align themselves with an aco or clinician. the proposed timeline for officially assigning a patient to an aco after he/she aligns with a clinician or opts-into an aco is both confusing and would cause unnecessary delays. to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 point, acos tend to have high patient churn, so waiting up to a year to be attributed to an aco makes little sense and would throw off benchmarking, risk adjustment, and other critical calculations. cms could also screen for program integrity by prompting beneficiaries to answer whether or not they had received any gifts or were improperly coerced in any way, as well as connect patients to quality data about his/her clinician and aco, creating a seamless and educational point of care experience for the patient while giving cms direct access to real-time beneficiary assignment and other relevant patient data that could improve program evaluation. the college supports efforts such as the ehealth initiative that aims to place the patient at the center of their own care and we feel this approach would better support these efforts, give cms more direct access to real-time data, and reduce expense and administrative burden for practices. this would also drastically lessen, if not eliminate altogether the need for cms to audit such records. it would be important to reconcile financial benchmarks accordingly based on the attribution methodology so that the two patient populations would match.\n 22\n finally, the college supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to designate additional services as primary care service codes. we agree that these codes are reflective of the robust range of services that are offered in the primary care setting and that adding these to the list of approved primary care service codes would lead to more accurate patient assignment.\n more meaningful quality measurement\n as iterated in previous comments, the college urges cms to reconsider the proposal to remove several at-risk population-based measures and to ensure that vulnerable patient populations would not be adversely impacted by the removal of these measures before proceeding. acp has always been a vocal advocate for prioritizing the study of social determinants of health and the role they play in individual and community health. we feel strongly that social determinants of health are currently underrepresented in quality measurement despite having a profound impact on risk factors and therefore patient health outcomes. care coordination across settings and incorporating behavioral and mental health services into a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total care plan are also critical elements of improving overall patient care that are under-emphasized and under-represented in current quality measurement. acp recently published a position paper3 with several policy recommendations for ways to better address social determinants to improve patient care and health equity. we encourage the agency to review and consider these recommendations in future rulemaking for the mssp and the medicare program at large.\n acp strongly recommends cms look to recommendations4 made by our performance measurement committee (pmc) when considering what measures to use for reporting by internal medicine specialists. the college further recommends that any measures cms proposes to use outside of the acp recommendations and core sets identified by the core quality measures collaborative be those recommended by the measure application partnership (map). the college has been a strong supporter of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 meaningful measures initiative, as well as other efforts to reduce burdens on clinicians and practices to improve the accuracy of quality measurement so that it can be better leveraged to improve patient care. we appreciate recent efforts to reduce the total number of quality measures, including for acos in the mssp, and to focus on outcomes and other high impact measures that maximize improved health outcomes while minimizing reporting burden on clinicians. acp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance measurement committee (pmc) assessed and provided detailed recommendations on numerous mips performance measures, with a focus on those that are particularly applicable to internal medicine.\n cms seeks comment on ways to improve information to combat opioid addiction and opioid-related measures that would support effective measurement of alignment of substance use disorders across programs, settings, and varying interventions.\n acp recommends cms: remove barriers to evidence-based non-opioid pain management services, improve medicare and medicaid patient access to medication- assisted treatment (mat) and overdose medications including naloxone, and work with states to increase clinician participation in prescription drug monitoring\n 23\n programs by making them less burdensome. cms also should also leverage this valuable data to study factors or demographics that predispose individuals to sud, including social determinants of health, as well as to better understand which treatment options or combinations of treatment options are most effective. however, the college wishes to issue a word of caution against imposing strict dosage caps, prior authorization requirements, and other hard cutoffs that could hinder access to critical pain treatments for patients who need them while placing an undue burden on practices.\n the college supports cms efforts to include more quality measures related to opioid use and has been an active leader in helping to address the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opioid epidemic.5 acp and other private sector stakeholders have been actively engaged in robust initiatives to educate and train clinicians on safe prescribing practices and there are positive signs these efforts are working. over a four-year period (2013-2017) opioid prescriptions fell by 22 percent nation-wide.6 over the eighteen months we have initiated programs to educate physicians on safe prescribing practices and how to prevent and treat substance use disorders (suds), published papers on how to facilitate effective prevention and treatment of suds, and addressed letters to congress and the administration with specific suggestions on how to combat this crisis. we urge the administration to review our past comments7 for a more robust discussion of our specific suggestions of strategies to address the opioid crisis, which we summarize briefly below. we also urge the administration to look to better integrate behavior health, including screening for possible sud in the primary care setting to catch sud in its earliest stages, and taking precautionary measures to prevent sud.\n we encourage the agency to continue adding more information to quarterly aco performance reports, dispensing this information on a more frequent, ideally real-time basis, and to make data more widely available so that all clinicians and practices, including non-aco participants, can leverage this data to improve patient care, address social inequities in health, correct inefficiencies to drive down costs, and help to address the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opioid epidemic and other pressing health crises.\n use of certified ehr technology (cehrt)\n cms proposes to require that acos in all tracks, including those that do not meet risk criteria to be considered advanced apms, certify that at least 50% of participating eligible clinicians use certified ehr technology (cehrt).\n acp urges cms to reconsider finalizing its proposed policy to require all mssp acos, including those that are not considered advanced apms, to certify that at least 50% of participating eligible clinicians use cehrt, particularly at the same time cms proposes to require a transition to 2015 edition cehrt. the college fully supports efforts to increase use of cehrt and promote interoperability of different cehrt systems. however, these systems can often be prohibitively expensive and administratively burdensome to implement, particularly for rural, small, and physician-led acos. we fear that this proposal could prohibit participation in the program, disproportionately so for\n 24\n smaller acos. in 2017, 34 acos would not have met this requirement and of those, roughly two-thirds (62.9%) had less than 10,000 beneficiaries. should the agency move forward with this policy in the future, we urge cms to provide acos with adequate financial assistance to support the purchasing and upgrading of ehr technology to meet cehrt standards, which can often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n hardship exceptions\n cms proposes to extend extreme and uncontrollable exceptions for 2018 and subsequent years and to reduce shared losses based on the percentage of total months in the performance year affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance.\n acp supports proposals to extend extreme and uncontrollable exceptions for 2018 an subsequent years. however, we have concerns over cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 one-size-fits all approach for determining the time period that acos would be exempted and we encourage cms to allow acos an opportunity to request relief from shared losses and negative quality adjustments over a longer period of time up to a full performance year, to be evaluated by cms on a case-by-case basis. the impact on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to collect and report data would be drastically different if that event occurs in the beginning months of a performance year, as opposed to the final months because this may interrupt systems or cause other long-lasting effects that would make it difficult to hold acos accountable for cost and quality long after the initial disaster has struck. further, while we appreciate cms recognizing that in certain circumstances acos may need more time to report quality data, in some cases, quality data may not be recoverable or may have not been collected during a period of crisis, and acos should not have this counted against them. because cms would approve of these on a situational basis, there is little risk in terms of the medicare trust funds, however, we feel it would be important to the integrity of the program for acos to have a formal process in place for making these requests based on extenuating circumstances.\n conclusion\n acp sincerely appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback on cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed changes to the mssp and thanks you for considering our comments. the college looks forward to continuing to work with cms to improve the mssp to ensure it remains a viable model long into the future and can continue to serve as a critical component of the transition to value- based reimbursement. please contact suzanne falk, senior associate, regulatory affairs at 202-261-4553 or sfalk@acponline.org with any questions or for more information.\n sincerely,\n\n\n\n

on behalf of lifespan health system, i appreciate the opportunity to provide these comments in response to the above-captioned proposed rule.\ni. background on lifespan, the lifespan health alliance aco, and the participation \n of many of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary care providers in cpc+. lifespan, rhode island's first health system, was founded in 1994 by rhode island hospital and the miriam hospital. a comprehensive, integrated, academic health system affiliated with the warren  alpert  medical  school  of  brown  university,  lifespan's  present  partners  also  include rhode  island  hospital's  pediatric  division, hasbro  children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  hospital;  bradley  hospital; newport hospital and gateway healthcare. a not-for-profit organization, lifespan is overseen by a board of volunteer community leaders who are guided by its mission: delivering health with care. in may of 2016, a group of provider organizations consisting of lifespan health system, nine major primary care practices and other primary care doctors entered into a partnership to create the lifespan health alliance (lha) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a medicare accountable care organization (aco) intended to redesign and improve care for medicare patients throughout rhode island. in july of 2016, lha formally submitted an application seeking approval as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrack 2\u00e2\u0080\u009d aco, and, in december of 2016, lha was accepted into the program and entered into a participation agreement with the center for medicare and medicaid services (cms) performance-based payment policy group (pbpg). on january 1, 2017, the program went live and lha was responsible for managing the quality and cost of care for attributed medicare beneficiaries.\n 2 #61250462_v1 infrastructure  and  tools  to  better  manage  these  patients. after  some  consideration,  cms determined that primary care physicians in rhode island would be allowed to participate in the lifespan health alliance aco and in the cpc+ program, but they would forego the pbips.\n\n\nii. cms needs to reconsider how it is accounting for handling the interaction between \n cpc+ and the medicare shared savings program.\n cms has made an error in how it is treating the cpc+ funding provided to primary care doctors who are simultaneously participating in shared risk (track 2 or track 3) acos. this regulation presents  an  opportunity  to  fix  this  problem  prospectively  with  respect  to  the  proposed enhanced  track  acos,  and  retrospectively  with  respect  to  certain  acos  in  cpc+ jurisdictions for the calendar performance years (pys) of 2017 and 2018.\n the root of the issue is that cms has established historical baselines for acos in 2016 and 2017 that do not account for future participation in the cpc+ program by many of their participating physicians. cms has then, in turn, counted all of the cpc+ program payments for cmfs and cpcps as beneficiary-attributed medicare fee-for-service spending in each program year. if there are future rounds of the cpc+ program, the problem will replicate itself for some organizations that decide to create enhanced track acos at the same time as their participating primary care physicians participate in cpc+.\n the treatment of the cpc+ funds as performance-year spending under the aco program creates an imbalance between the historical baseline and the annual financial performance metrics. for future years, cms should provide by regulation for a mechanism by which the aco historical benchmarks can be modified to account for participation by aco providers in cpc+ or any similar future program proposed by cmmi. requiring an anomaly such as this to populate the data for the entire five-year term of a new aco agreement is unwise, unfair and unnecessary. rather, cms can simply provide by regulation for a process by which that historical benchmark can be modified to account for the unanticipated spending. in the alternative, cms can exclude some or all of the spending  related  to  the  cmmi  initiative  from  the  attributed  per-beneficiary  medicare  fee-for- service (ffs) spending (as discussed further below).\n with regard to 2017 and 2018 aco program years, cms need merely exercise its discretionary authority to revise how it measures attributable aco spending in those program years to exclude some or all of the spending derived from cpc+. to include all of the cmfs and cpcp payments in the program years for an at-risk aco is problematic for two basic reasons: (1) it fundamentally misunderstands  the  premise  of  the  cpc+  program;  and  (2)    it  is  contrary  to  the  statute. additionally,  there  is  sound  reason  to  not  include  all  of  the  cpc+  payments  as  individually identified per-beneficiary medicare ffs spending for attributed beneficiaries.\n\n a. cpc+ is not a shared savings program. \n\n 3 #61250462_v1 department utilization and in-patient utilization (the pbip-u component). at best, only half of the measurement of program improvement can be said to be related to utilization and the tie to savings is  very  amorphous. the  utilization  metrics  themselves  are  not  necessarily  tied  to  any  actual reduction in medicare spending below a benchmark. mathematica policy research concluded as much in its may 2018 fourth annual report of the comprehensive primary care initiative that formed the basis for cpc+. mathematica concluded that cpc did  not lead to  any statistically significant changes in total medicare expenditures (excluding care management fees) and did not generate enough savings in any event to offset the care management fees.1 the administration was well aware of this when it implemented cpc+, which is why the program is not structured as a shared savings initiative.\n moreover, social security act section 1899(e)(4)(a) prohibits a medicare shared savings program from also participating in another shared savings risk initiative advanced by cmmi. primary care doctors in acos were allowed to also participate in cpc+ precisely because it is not a shared risk model. but by putting all of the cpc+ revenues into the performance year spending calculation, cms has incorporated a requirement that any aco must save in every program year an amount equal to that spending in order to avoid risk. by doing this, cms has turned the cpc+ program into an at-risk initiative for those acos with cpc+ participation. this is contrary to the explicit prohibition in section 1899(e)(4)(a).\n b. not all cpc+ payments to primary care physicians should be    \n considered individually beneficiary identifiable payments. payments  to  a  primary  care  practice  under  cpc+  must  be  used  for  specific,  delineated  care delivery  requirements,  and  the recipients  must  document  that  the  funds  were  used  for  this purpose. requirements  vary between  track  1  and  track  2  participants,  and  between  the  care management  fee  and  the  cpcp  payments,  but  many  of  these  payments  are  earmarked  for improvements in a primary care practice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infrastructure, such as: ensuring 24/7 access to a care team; organizing care by practice-identified teams; regularly offering alternatives to traditional office visits; or identifying high spend/high volume specialists. these types of usages are not in line with traditional per beneficiary ffs spending, which is why they are identified as \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-claims based payments\u00e2\u0080\u009d by cms.\nc. changes  should  be  both  retroactive  regarding  track  2  and  prospective \n regarding track 3. for all of these reasons, cms needs to reconsider its treatment of cpc+ program payments to primary care providers who are simultaneous participants in track 2 and 3 acos, and to make a similar change on a going-forward basis for the new enhanced track acos. cms  should exclude cpc+ payments  in  their  entirety  from  the  benchmark and from  the expenditures on both a retrospective and proactive basis. for lha, and any other similarly situated risk-bearing track 2 or 3 acos, that would mean updating all performance years of the agreement\n 4 #61250462_v1 (2017-2019 for lha) by either updating the original historical benchmark or by removing cpc+ program payments as \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-claims based payments\u00e2\u0080\u009d in lha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expenditures. all such cpc+ payments in the enhanced track should similarly be excluded from the benchmark and the performance year expenditures. if cms is unwilling to exclude these payments in their entirety, lha offers cms two alternatives to consider:\n1. one simple alternative would be to bifurcate the cmf and cpcp funds such that one-half \n are  considered  as  per-beneficiary  program  spending  (corresponding  to  the  pbip-u component of the incentive structure) and one-half are not.\n2. another alternative would be for cms to phase in the cpc+ payments into performance \n year  expenditures  during  the  agreement  period  to  match  the  phase-in  of  weights  for benchmark  years. there is no magic switch that takes place such that cpc+ payments beginning in 2017 will immediately and automatically produce an equivalent amount of utilization savings in that exact same year. accordingly, we recommend as an alternative that cms recognize 10% of cpc+ payments as expenditures in py1, 30% in py2 and 60% in py3. this would far better recognize the amount of time it takes for utilization declines to actually occur following from the cpc+ payments.\niii.   timing of transition to enhanced aco status from track 2 participation.  \n\n as a current track 2 participant contracted through py 2019, lha would like the opportunity to roll our participation into enhanced as quickly as possible, and with as little disruption as possible.\n first, if cms does not fully exclude the cpc+ payments as we have requested above, cms should provide the opportunity for lha and similarly situated \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing\u00e2\u0080\u009d acos to rebase our historic benchmark going into the enhanced track to fully account for any cpc+ payments that cms is continuing  to  treat  as  performance  year  expenditures. accordingly,  we  recommend  that  you provide an exception to enable track 2 and 3 acos shifting into the enhanced track that have physicians participating in the cpc+ program to shift from track 2 to the enhanced track as soon as is practicable to enable rebasing of the benchmark, ideally on july 1, 2019 and without penalty.\n second, we recommend that cms make it clear that \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing\u00e2\u0080\u009d track 2 and 3 acos may move into the new enhanced track without jeopardizing our aapm/mips exemption for that year of the transition.\n\niv. provisions of the proposed rule lha supports.  \n\n lha applauds cms for providing much needed changes on several aspects of the proposed rule. we recommend that you retain the following provisions.\n 5 #61250462_v1 including  the  ability  for  risk  scores  to  fluctuate  by  reasonable  amounts  over  time recognizes the complexity of a treatment population and its respective disease burden. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 waivers. in  general,  payment  rule  waivers  are  widely  seen  as  important  for  patient engagement, and we support the proposed waivers in the proposed rule. the three-day snf  waiver will  be particularly  helpful with care  coordination  and  patient  transitions, allowing us to match the most appropriate level and place of care to a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs. this is particularly true given cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow critical access hospitals and certain small,  rural  hospitals  to  partner  with  eligible  acos  under  the  rule  waiver,  expanding patient access to appropriate care. we support future efforts by cms to streamline the waiver process, including patient evaluation requirements, to ensure greater usability by acos. these changes will lead to reduced overall medical expenditures. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 reduced burden on quality reporting. we appreciate and support the proposed rule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changes to substantially reduce the burdens on quality reporting programs and to ensure greater consistency across our reporting requirements. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 beneficiary assignment. lha strongly supports the proposed rule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changes to provide additional flexibility  to  choose  the  assignment  methodology  (prospective  vs. retrospective).\n\nv. provisions of the proposed rule lha opposes.  \n\n lha has  serious  concerns  about  other  aspects  of  the  proposals  with  regard  to  beneficiary notification and assignment. further, we are very concerned about a financial review criterion that would enable cms to terminate an aco with two consecutive years of losses.\n 6 #61250462_v1 adjustment is  treated differently  across multiple medicare programs.  as  such, we urge cms  to  engage  relevant  stakeholders  to  determine  the  elements  of  a  reasonable  risk adjustment methodology appropriate to the majority of acos.\n we  appreciate  very  much  your  consideration  of  these requested  adjustments in  the  final  rule.

operated. our non-profit aco makes up a minority of mssp acos participating, that serve almost exclusively low income and underserved populations in many hpsas. our aco, consists of a disproportionate share dual eligibles (16%) and disabled (33%), including 3 times the esrd proportion (3%) beneficiary attribution. 39% of the beneficiaries in our aco are under the age of 65. we have over 400 primary care practitioners of the 169 primary care centers that serve the aco attributables, all but 7 are federally qualified health centers. it should also be noted that many of the primary care practitioners that render services at the 169 sites are subsidized by national health services corp. even though our aco is not hospital-owned, we connect with 30+ hospitals in georgia. while our participant roster changed dramatically as of january 1, 2018, removing a large, municipal hospital partner that would not in engage and execute on our aco value-based care strategies (strategies that none the less generated reduction of unnecessary medical costs by 5.6% on average for each year [2013-2016] with our aco only collecting a shared savings payment from cms for py 2015. the expansion took our aco from urban to rural, comprising the largest fqhc networks in all parts of the state of georgia. in our 6th year under the program, it occurred only py 2017 that our aco generated a deficit, attributed to the large hospital systems failure to execute aco-mandated ccm and tcm programs, and that same partner soft steering medicare beneficiaries into high cost specialty care. the chronic disease prevalence within our cohort is 2-3 times higher than the national average, with higher than average ed utilization due to social determinants of health (sdh) barriers. our aco generated approximately $11.6m in savings. safety-net acos are not special but are different. the question has been raised on numerous occasions by our aco board as to whether or not cms accounts for the following in the benchmarking methods: does the benchmarking methods accurately account for the fact that fqhcs are paid on a prospective rating method set by prior year cost reporting. given that fqhcs are funded in subsidy in part through the dhhs public health service, in terms of investment, and similarly a revised program should provide for some cmmi investment in the development and management operations of a aco that consists predominantly of fqhcs. our aco analyzed early on that many of our the chronically-ill attributed beneficiaries were being managed, seemingly with disconcerting intention by hospital er, that set the goal to steal medicare beneficiaries from the fqhcs. the forged collaboration resulted in a strong ed diversion program, all at the direct expense borne by the fqhcs. add to the rule that acos, comprised largely of fqhc and community-based (non-hospital connected) acos be allowed to receive re-instated aco aim model to protect such supplemental operational funding from exposure to undo risk. the fqhcs under our aco have make significant strides in appropriating their hierarchical condition coding for more accurate risk assessment and adjustment. prior the acos formation, and despite the fact that most of the health centers locations participated in some level of vbr with medicare advantage plans, sure organizations were not adept or focused on specific codes and such activity did make less that known difference in their pps reimbursement. in this regard, our aco has reached exceptional milestones, and is beginning to see the return on its real intended value: to have a sustainable and reliable infrastructure capable of assuming and performing consistently well under risk but also not put government dollars at undue risk. the mssp should account for the infrastructure, and most importantly the extraneous and intensive infrastructure to deliver not only clinical needs with high tech, high touch service, but especially social determinant needs, that are in excess and fall well outside of the calculated benchmark expenditures and go almost fully un/under accounted, even with the prospective payment model. our methods are well defined in our initial application and delivered largely by on the one year that shared savings were fully attained. the current benchmarking factors dont address sdh barriers which contribute to deficits as a result. it also seems that behavioral health (substance abuse and mental health) and social determinant of health are underfunded for disparate populations. we propose cms have a separate allocation of funding to address psychosocial needs and sdh at fqhcs, which probably has a lower prevalence in affluent populations/communities. alter the regional benchmark to allocate more of the regional spend for fqhcs which could address the costs associated with social determinants of health.", "0437": "centers for medicare and medicaid services\r\ndepartment of health

efforts to improve beneficiary assignment in the mssp; however, we believe neither acos nor beneficiaries would benefit from finalizing the opt-in based assignment methodology. instead, we recommend cms focus on voluntary alignment and eliminate finalizing the opt-in based assignment methodology. according to the notice of proposed rulemaking (nprm), cms states \"it would be important for acos to manage notifying beneficiaries, collecting beneficiary opt-in data, and reporting the opt-in data to\ncms. on an annual basis, acos would notify their beneficiary population about their participation in the \n under this proposal, acos would still be required to bear risk, but have the flexibility to move to the level of risk that best suits their organization. new acos could transition to risk during their first agreement period, and then spend an additional agreement period in the basic track level e gaining valuable experience with risk. more seasoned acos could test a moderate increase in risk through a voluntary intermediate track with a risk cap of 8% of the benchmark and a shared savings rate of 65%. this provides an option for acos that are prepared to increase risk from level e but are not comfortable moving to the high level of risk in the enhanced track. lastly, uchealth integrated network requests cms reevaluate the proposed shared savings rates and finalize a shared savings rate of 50% beginning in the first year of the basic track. a 25 percentage- point decrease in the shared savings rate, coupled with mandatory increases in risk, could strongly deter new acos from participating in the mssp. we thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on this proposed rule. if you have any questions, please contact myself or kristyn ulrich, director of finance, at

cms\u00e2\u0080\u00931701\u00e2\u0080\u0093p submitted electronically to: http://www.regulations.gov\n\n re: cms\u00e2\u0080\u00931701-p medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-pathways to success.\n dear administrator verma:\n on behalf of the avera, a catholic health system with over 300 facilities located in southeast south dakota and the surrounding region, we appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) medicare shared savings program (mssp) pathways to success proposed rule.\n avera appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued commitment to accountable care organizations (acos). medicare acos have been successful in reducing health care costs and improving quality. the recent mssp pathways to success proposed rule estimates that the overall impact of acos, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cspillover effects\u00e2\u0080\u009d on medicare spending outside of the aco program, lowered spending by $1.8 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $4.2 billion (0.5\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 1.2 percent) in 2016 alone. additionally, when assessing the counterfactual, comparing acos \n performance in comparison to what medicare spending would have otherwise been, acos estimate savings are approximately 2 percent higher1. for example, peer-reviewed studies found that the mssp saved more than $200 million in 2013 and 2014 and $144.6 million in 2015 after accounting for shared savings bonuses earned by acos2. a similar study found that acos saved $1.84 billion from 2013 through 2015 and reduced medicare spending by $542 million after accounting for shared savings bonuses3. avera firmly believes that the aco model is a successful approach for encouraging providers to work together to reduce costs and improve the quality of healthcare for medicare beneficiaries.\n supporting the movement to these value-based payment models goes beyond the quality and financial results of acos. from a market perspective, we will never achieve innovation in healthcare except through the creative power of healthcare providers seeking to innovate the care delivery\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 2 of 13\n\n process. models in which payers seek to achieve savings and quality improvement will always fall short until healthcare providers themselves are held accountable for the results. we have seen firsthand the remarkable innovations that are spurred by this accountability such as those in telehealth, the hospital in the home, special care centers, organizing community support organizations and systematically addressing the social determinates of health.\n the pathways to success establishes a step-wise approach for acos increasingly taking on more downside risk. avera agrees that it is imperative that over time providers become increasingly responsible for total cost of care through risk-bearing agreements; however, cms must ensure providers have proper tools and experience to achieve this vision. we believe that with proper incentives and improvements in the program organizations will take on risk, seeing the quality, clinical innovation and business benefit from doing so. specifically, cms should consider the following within the context of mssp and any new payment models:\n sufficient time in an upside-only model prior to moving to downside risk. acos are more likely to achieve shared savings with time. specifically, studies show that the shared savings rate doubles with three years of experience from 21 percent for acos in the first year to over 40 percent for acos in the third of fourth year4. accordingly, avera recommends at least 3 years in an upside only model for new acos entering the mssp. beyond the mssp program, avera believes it is imperative for cms to provide a long-term vision and roadmap for the transition to value-based and risk-based models. in the absence of a clear timeline, some providers are reluctant to embark on new models. when providers have a clear plan for moving to new models (e.g. the maryland all-payer model), providers work aggressively to succeed in the model and more rapidly advance to the risk-bearing model.\n high performers should be encouraged to participate in models regardless of provider type. the mssp performance data summarizes average aco performance, masking differences among high and low performers within each category. we strongly discourage the application of policies targeting provider types that are intended to modify the behavior of the lowest performers; these policies impact high and low performers, thereby disincentivizing high performers from continuing in the model and producing savings. specifically, we request that cms eliminate the distinction of high and low revenue acos and avoid creating new blunt tools to define acos (e.g. physician-led and hospital-led). in any payment model cms should create a level competitive playing field and let those that perform best succeed most. cms should find non-provider defined approaches to eliminate poor performers.\n ensure a business case for taking on risk. cms must ensure that acos and new payment models, particularly voluntary models, provide incentives for taking on risk. the existing models to date have ignored the significant investment costs required to start or continue participation in a model. even when these costs are not incorporated into the payment model, providers will consider potential return on investment when determining whether to enter a new model. cms must recognize this dynamic and ensure that acos and other models will attract providers. specifically, cms should:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increase the shared savings rate for acos to at least 50 percent. as discussed below reducing the savings rate prevents acos from recouping initial investments, reinvesting savings into population health activities, and recruiting providers with the use of gainsharing agreements.\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 3 of 13\n\n\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 provide additional flexibility in the models for acos taking on risk. to be best suited to take on more risk, within an aco or any payment mode, and effectively manage the care of populations providers require flexibility. while beneficial, the current approaches to providing flexibility (e.g. snf and telehealth waivers, beneficiary incentive program) represent limited portions of medicare benefits and thus limited opportunities for transforming care. within the next generation aco model cms incorporated several options that provide flexibility and should be considered for inclusion in the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0094choice on enrolling tin or npi, infrastructure payment, prepayment of shared savings and primary capitation.\n redesigning participation options to facilitate performance-based risk\n phase-in of performance-based risk in the basic track cms proposes to redesign the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance-based risk tracks by retiring track 1 (no risk, upside only) and track 2 and creating a new basic track. in the basic track, participants could begin participation in a one-sided risk model and phase-in risk over the course of a single agreement period; the highest level of risk is comparable to the current track 1+. additionally, the proposed rule retains track 3, renaming it as the enhanced track. eligible acos would enter into these two tracks for an agreement period of 5 years (the first agreement period, if stated in july 2019 would be 5 years and 6 months). within the basic track, cms proposes a glide path that includes 5 levels: a one-sided risk model available only for the first two consecutive performance years (levels a & b), and three levels of progressively higher risk and potential reward in performance years 3 through 5 of the agreement period (levels c, d, and e). acos would automatically advance at the start of each participation years along this glide path until they reach the track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maximum level of risk/reward (designed to be the same as the track 1+ model).\n avera supports an agreement period of at least 5 years, as we believe that this adds stability to the program. we have serious concerns, however, that the progression cms proposes to two-sided risk in the basic track is far too aggressive and will deter participation in the mssp. we believe that the two years in a one-sided risk model is insufficient for acos to prepare for moving to downside risk. numerous studies show that acos require about 3-4 years to become successful.5 this is not surprising given that acos receive feedback on their performance several months into their first agreement period\u00e2\u0080\u0095any initiatives designed to improve performance always take more time than anticipated, and this is particularly true for the complex organizations and agreements that comprise an aco. organizations need time to make the structural, cultural, and practice changes required to successfully manage and assume financial risk for a population. in recognition of the time required for acos to be successful, cms should allow at least three years of no-downside risk within the basic track to ensure the success of participating acos and encourage future participation. cms should extend an optional fourth year in a one-sided track for acos that achieve savings, not necessarily shared savings, and have high quality.\n shared savings rate avera strongly urges cms to set the entry-level risk for the basic track at 50 percent with gradual increases in the shared-savings rate as acos progress through the various levels. lowering the shared-\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 4 of 13\n\n savings rate for acos with no downside risk from 50 percent to 25 percent provides little incentive for new acos to join the program. the low shared-savings rate also does not consider the substantial investment needed on the part of acos. according to an analysis by the aha, the investment required to put in place and sustain the elements necessary for a successful aco has been $11.6 to $26.1 million higher than previous estimates by cms. these costs, coupled with the cost of having a repayment mechanism in place to cover losses, creates a high hurdle for organizations who are transitioning to accountable care.\n the proposed shared savings rate is a significant decrease for existing acos, which will be unable to reinvest savings back into population management and care coordination. shared savings payments are critical as part of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transformation toward value-based care and are necessary to incentivize providers to make the infrastructure investments needed to transform care delivery and processes. without them, acos will struggle to provide care and services needed to appropriately manage the health of the population and move more rapidly to risk, undermining the overall goal of the program. reducing shared savings also produces problems with provider participation and aco buy-in, as some organizations already find this difficult at current shared savings level. to incentivize acos to take on risk, cms should increase the shared-savings rates as acos take on additional risk. we recommend increasing the shared savings by 5 percent with each step: levels a/b: 50 percent; levels c/d: 55 percent; and level e: 60 percent.\n calculation of loss sharing limit avera supports using the lower of the revenue-based or historical benchmark for calculation of the loss sharing limit. however, we recommend that cms align the risk level for track e with the nominal risk threshold for apm models established under the qpp, which is 3 percent of the historical benchmark, rather than the 4 percent cms proposes. cms provides no rationale for setting the benchmark-based loss limit at the nominal risk standard plus one percentage point. the purpose of track e is to provide aco entities with a more gradual pathway to risk, while also meeting the requirements of an aapm. setting the historical-benchmark at a higher level would disproportionately affect acos with hospital participants and subject them to additional risk as they will always use the historical-based benchmark since medicare part a and b revenue will far exceed the historic-based benchmark. accordingly, increasing the benchmark-based loss limit creates an unlevel playing field for acos that include hospital participants this proposed policy is counter to the goal of acos to encourage providers to work together to improve care for beneficiaries and discourages both health-system led and physician-led acos from recruiting hospital participants.\n cms should allow all acos to remain in track e or whatever track meets the nominal risk requirements under qpp. if cms increases the qpp aapm nominal risk threshold, cms should create a glidepath in mssp for acos to transition to the new standard of risk.\n transition from level e to enhanced track\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 5 of 13\n\n tracks. to further maximize interest in acos transitioning to the enhacned track, cms should start the shared savings rate to 80 percent (same as the next generation aco program) and increase the maximum shared savings and losses rate over the agreement period.\n permitting annual participation elections\n annual risk election cms proposes to allow acos in the basic track to more rapidly transition (i.e., skip a level or levels) during the agreement period, but level e must be entered into no later than the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth performance year under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal. premier encourages cms to provide acos with more flexibility in their annual participation elections. if an aco selects a higher level of risk than it would have been automatically assigned, it should not be required to automatically advance the following year (i.e. an aco is not required to advance beyond the track they would have been assigned if they did not choose to advance to a higher track). as noted earlier, acos require additional time moving to risk. this option would provide acos the option to gain experience in a limited risk track for more than one year. additionally, we ask that cms consider allowing high performing acos more than one year in limited risk tracks (i.e. level c and d); cms could set parameters for successful acos to continue in a particular track prior to automatic advancing (i.e. achieving savings, not necessarily shared savings, and high quality).\n annual election of beneficiary assignment in alignment with the bipartisan budget act of 2018, cms proposes to allow all acos with a choice of prospective assignment for the agreement periods beginning july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years. as proposed, acos would also be able to change its beneficiary assignment methodology through the annual election process.  avera disagrees with this proposal, due to our concern that the attribution of patients to an aco, who designate a provider through mycms.gov without maintaining, at a minimum, the criteria of an established relationship between that patient and the provider creates an unreasonable expectation in terms of the ability to manage both patient conditions and cost utilization.\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 6 of 13\n\n provider, unfairly pushes the burden of cost and quality onto aco providers, regardless of an actual relationship, which is counter to the primary purpose.\n determining participation options based on medicare ffs revenue and prior participation\n cms proposes to define participation options by making a distinction between low revenue acos and high revenue acos. high revenue acos are a proxy for acos that typically include a hospital billing through an aco participant tin; cms defines this as an aco whose total part a and b revenue for aco participants is greater than the total parts a and b expenditures for aco assigned beneficiaries. acos falling below this threshold are considered low-revenue acos, a proxy for physician group acos. cms believes that high revenue acos are more capable of accepting higher risk than low revenue acos. cms provides fewer participation options for high revenue acos. high revenue acos with \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d can only participate in the enhanced track regardless of whether they are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cre- entering\u00e2\u0080\u009d the program. in addition, low revenue (and inexperienced) acos may operate under the basic track for a maximum of two agreement periods, whereas high revenue acos are limited to one agreement period.\n avera strongly opposes this proposal and urges cms to eliminate the low/high revenue distinction for determining participation options. we firmly believe that all acos should the treated the same. this proposed distinction is unnecessary and harmful, as it would discourage acos that have the potential to generate substantial savings to the program from participating. the premise cms uses for hospital-led versus physician-led distinction is also flawed. cms argues that this policy decision is due in part to low revenue acos producing 2 percent of savings compared to 0.2 percent for high-revenue acos. an analysis, completed by premier healthcare alliance, of hospital-led vs. physician-led acos revealed two- major findings that refute this assumption: their analysis of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 definition of hospital-led (the aco includes a hospital tin participant) found that it is inaccurate with at least 20 percent of health system- led acos being designated as \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician led.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  some of the highest performing individual acos are hospital-led acos.  additionally, as cms is aware, the intent of acos is to align providers, hospitals, clinics, post-acute and home care professionals to better coordinate care, improve quality, and lower cost. carving physicians out of these collaborative practices is counterproductive to the goals of this program.\n cms argues that many low-revenue acos are not well-capitalized and therefore unable to absorb losses as well as high-revenue acos. regardless of structure, significant investments are needed in population health platforms and care process changes for acos to bear risk. medicare revenue is also not indicative of ability to bear risk. cms is unable to identify if an aco is well capitalized through sources outside of medicare revenue (i.e., insurer or investor backed acos). accordingly, cms is unable to truly identify whether an aco is well capitalized and thus should not create distinctions based on assumptions about capital. setting up a system that disadvantages hospital-led acos limits the types of innovations needed to build a high performing healthcare system for the range of communities across the nation.\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 7 of 13\n\n break down the artificial silos that cause duplicative, fragmented patient care. acos do not drive physician employment, but rather, acos support greater clinical integration and collaboration among doctors, hospitals and other care providers and align the payment system to incent coordination and cost savings across these silos. this alignment accomplishes what the model is designed to do, and what providers need out of high-value networks, without necessitating employment of physicians. some of the most effective acos in our nation engage a majority of independent clinicians. the greatest fear related to consolidation is its potential to lead to higher prices. ultimately, the only way to protect against escalating costs is to advance these alternative payment models that hold providers accountable and give them the opportunity to improve care and reduce costs for an entire population.\n avera believes that the goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients. the best way to drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate, to innovate, and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare. including a hospital is an effective way to balance the need for access to specialty care while increasing the focus on primary care. one might argue that an aco should require a hospital participant and other providers across the care continuum to ensure that acos do not simply keep patients away from a particular setting but ensure patients receive care in the least restrictive setting. while it would be absurd to define what providers an aco must include it is equally absurd to say that acos that work to include multiple provider types should be forced to risk sooner.\n avera believes that healthy market competition relies on a level playing field. this administration has been outspoken in advocating for market solutions and level playing fields among competitors.  this proposed policy, however, is contrary to a market-based approach whereby all competitors have similar opportunities for success. whenever there is an uneven playing field, one competitor will use it to their advantage over another.  alternatively, competitors can take steps to game the system.  advantaging one group over another can also create perverse incentives to undermine a competitor overall.\n defining participation options by \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cms also proposes to limit participations options by categorizing acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d with performance-based risk medicare aco initiatives and determining participation options based on prior participation of aco legal entity and aco participants. cms defines a \u00e2\u0080\u009cre- entering aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d as (1) the same legal entity as an aco, identified by tin, or a (2) new legal entity that has never participated in the mssp and is applying to participate in the program and more than 50 percent of its aco participants were included on the aco participant list. cms defines an experienced aco that meets either of the following criteria: (1) the aco is the same legal entity as a current or previous aco that is participating in, or has participated in, a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under track 2 or track 3; or (2) 40 percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or in an aco that deferred its entry into a mssp agreement period under track 2 or track 3, in any of the 5 most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 8 of 13\n\n an appeals process. for example, it is possible that two separate acos discontinue operation in a region then a new entity, completely unaffiliated with either prior entity, forms in the region and recruits participants involved in the prior organization. the intent of the policy is to avoid gaming of the options for the glidepath not to discourage new entities. to balance this potential outcome, cms should also consider a second criterion, setting a threshold for a percentage of participants that previously were in the same entity. for example, cms would first identify if 50 percent of participants would qualify aco to be reentering or experienced; then if less than 30 percent of participants were part of the same legal entity then the aco could appeal the label of reentering or experienced.\n monitoring for financial performance\n cms proposes additional provisions to address an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial performance when an aco may otherwise be in compliance with program requirements. cms states that just as poor quality performance can subject an aco to remedial action or termination, an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to lower growth in medicare ffs expenditures should be the basis for cms to take pre-termination actions. these actions could include a request for corrective action by the aco, or termination of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement. specifically, cms proposes to terminate acos if it is negative outside corridor for two agreement periods. cms appears to be particularly concerned about one-sided risk acos that continue to participate in the program and generate net losses to medicare.\n avera opposes the cms proposal to terminate acos if negative outside corridor for two agreement periods. we believe that these additional provisions, if implemented, would provide cms with too much discretion to terminate aco participation in the program. we are concerned that such unchecked authority provided to cms would further discourage acos participating in the mssp, as this would create additional uncertainty for participants and would also make it difficult to establish agreements with other organizations. moreover, cms proposals with respect to the glide path that would limit participation in one-sided risk models would also provide acos with incentives to leave the program if they were not able to generate savings.\n election of minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss rate (mlr) by acos\n cms proposes that acos under the basic track would have the same msr/mlr options that are currently available to acos under one-sided and two-side models of the mssp. acos under the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path in level a or level b would choose the msr/mlr to be applied before the start of their first performance year in a two-sided model. cms also proposes to use a variable msr/mlr when performing shared savings and shared losses if an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population falls below 5,000 for the performance year, regardless of whether the aco selected a fixed or variable msr/mlr. avera supports these proposals and appreciates the flexibility these options provide to meet acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs.\n participation options for agreement periods beginning in 2019\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 9 of 13\n\n 30, 2019. cms notes that this election to extend the agreement period is voluntary and an aco could therefore conclude its participation in the program with the expiration of its current agreement period on december 31, 2018.\n avera is concerned that this policy will result in an aco managing the costs and quality of two separate beneficiary populations. each six-month performance period has two distinct assignment windows and methodologies. moreover, if an aco changes its participant lists between the six-month extension and the start of the new model, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aligned beneficiaries could be significantly different. while some beneficiaries will be attributed to the aco for both performance periods, there will be a portion of an acos beneficiary that are attributed for only one performance period. for beneficiaries attributed for only the first performance period, the aco will have to continue to deploy resources to manage this population after they are no longer aligned with the aco and the aco is unable to take advantage of the waivers available in the program. for beneficiaries attributed only in the second performance period, the aco will be responsible for costs incurred in the first half of the year when the aco had no ability to manage the beneficiaries care.\n managing two distinct patient populations will require the aco to be responsible for the beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cost and quality during a time in which the aco is unable to manage the patient. as a result, acos will have to scale up resources and infrastructure for one performance period in order to mitigate the quality and cost impact. moreover, with little influence over beneficiaries expenditures outside of the performance period acos could potentially be at risk for exceeding their benchmark. to mitigate this impact, cms should provide an option to allow acos in current models to extend their agreements for one year, resulting in a start date of january 1, 2020 for entering the new model. cms could still provide a july 1, 2019 start date option for new and existing acos. at a minimum, cms should use a singular assignment window and methodology to determine the assigned population for the entire calendar year 2019, regardless of whether they are in an extended agreement or the new model.\n finally, we are concerned that implementation issues could arise if cms rushes the application process, so we urge cms to ensure that there is enough time for cms and participants to prepare for an application cycle after the final rule. avera asks that cms delay the july 1, 2019 start and offer a one- year extension to all current acos who are ending their agreements if cms is not ready to implement a new model.\n benchmarking methodology refinements\n risk adjustment methodology\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 10 of 13\n\n enhanced track should align with the percentage change in risk scores for ma plans.\n use of regional factors when establishing and resetting aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmarks\n cms proposes to incorporate regional expenditures into the benchmarking methodology for acos in a first agreement period for all acos entering the program beginning on july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years. under current policy, the maximum weight applied to the regional adjustment is 70 percent. cms proposes policies that would limit the magnitude of the adjustment by reducing the weight (to a maximum of 50 percent) and imposing an absolute dollar limit on the adjustment (capped at 5 percent of the national per capita expenditures for parts a and b services in baseline year 3 for assignable beneficiaries).\n avera is concerned that these regional adjustments do not accurately adjust rural-based health care systems. these adjustments are based on the assumption that risk is evenly distributed. however in rural counties, typically only one health care system present is present, access to care is often with an advanced practice provider, and physician visits occur primarily through a specialist. these factors cause the majority of an attributable population for a rural county is beneficiaries that have accessed a specialist, which makes for a more complex and costly population. this complex population is skewed to the lone health care system, offering access to specialties in the region, while the remainder of the population, which is relatively healthy and low cost, is not attributed because they have not had a physician visit. as such, avera requests that cms: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 expand the definition of region beyond the local county level to include nearby markets where physician access is more distributed; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 exclude rural areas from regional adjustments.\n\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements\n skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver expansion\n currently, the snf 3-day rule waiver can be requested only by those mssp acos that bear performance-based risk and to whom beneficiaries are prospectively assigned.  cms proposes to expand the waiver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s applicability beginning july 1, 2019, to include performance-risk bearing acos that utilize preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment.  in all cases, the snf must be an eligible affiliate of the aco and, in most cases, have a rating of 3 stars or better in the cms five-star snf quality rating system.  (cms also is proposing to allow swing bed operators, who are not included in the star rating system, to become eligible snf affiliates.)  the waiver is available currently to track 3 and track 1+ acos; the proposed expansion would include track 2, basic track levels c, d, and e and the enhanced track.  avera strongly supports the proposed expansion of snf 3-day rule waiver applicability as another important tool with which acos can more effectively coordinate care while increasing quality and reducing unnecessary costs.\n telehealth waiver expansion\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 11 of 13\n\n telehealth services are furnished to ffs beneficiaries by mssp aco professionals.  the waiver would take effect beginning with performance year 2020 and be limited to those acos that bear performance- based risk and to whom beneficiaries are prospectively assigned.  the services must be billed through the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tin and may not be designated as inpatient-only. the expanded telehealth policy would apply to track 3 and to track 1+ acos as well as to those on the newly proposed enhanced track and on levels c, d, and e of the basic track.  avera strongly supports the telehealth expansion as proposed, particularly when combined with the increased flexibility that would occur with the proposed ability for acos to annually elect either prospective or preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment.\n other needed waivers\n avera notes once again that additional waivers are critical to removing persistent legal and regulatory barriers that inhibit mssp aco providers from working together to provide better-coordinated, high- quality care, most notably pertaining to the applicable fraud and abuse laws (e.g., the stark and anti- kickback statutes and the beneficiary inducements civil monetary penalty (cmp) provisions).  avera continues to recommend that cms should issue: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an aco \u00e2\u0080\u009cpre-participation\u00e2\u0080\u009d waiver to protect aco-related start-up arrangements, in anticipation of new mssp participants and the proposed redesigned tracks; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an aco participation waiver that applies broadly to aco-related arrangements during the term of the participation agreement; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 a shared savings distributions waiver that applies to distributions and uses of any earned shared savings payments or internal costs savings.\n\n tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n opt-in assignment methodology\n cms discusses at length and invites comments about all aspects of a hybrid assignment methodology that would include direct aco opt in (a beneficiary chooses assignment to a specific aco); voluntary alignment with an aco professional (with resulting assignment to the aco in which that professional participates); and a modification of the current claims-based assignment methodology (incorporating a minimum level of primary care visits furnished to a beneficiary).  cms does not make any formal proposal about the hybrid methodology nor indicate a timeline for further consideration of its implementation.\n in general, avera is concerned about any additional cost and administrative burdens placed on providers and practices due to further mandates, especially those that do not improve quality for beneficiaries.\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 12 of 13\n\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 expeditiously test an option for beneficiary opt-in directly to an aco (in parallel to the existing beneficiary voluntary alignment directly to an aco professional). testing should explore appropriate marketing opportunities for acos analogous to those for ma plans \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 explore additional approaches hybrid assignment and choose one or more for limited-scale testing before proposing any program-wide replacement mssp assignment methodology, cms should explore rules for rejecting opt-in or voluntary assignment (e.g. when a beneficiary resides outside the geographic region, when a beneficiary does not receive at least one service from a participating provider in the aco).\n updating program policies\n voluntary alignment policy revisions\n medicare ffs beneficiaries may choose to designate an aco professional as their primary clinician for coordinating their care, and the beneficiary who does so becomes voluntarily aligned to the designated professional\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aco.  currently, a primary clinician must be either a primary care practitioner or practice one of a limited list of specialties (e.g., cardiology), and the beneficiary must have received at least one primary care service from a professional who practices primary care or a listed specialty in the aligned\naco.  as part of bba 2018 implementation, cms proposes policy revisions to begin with performance \n year 2019 including removing the specialty restrictions to primary clinician eligibility and no longer requiring the voluntarily aligned beneficiary to have received any services from a professional in the aligned aco during the applicable beneficiary assignment window.  avera supports the removal of specialty restrictions for primary clinicians but recommends retention of the requirement for a beneficiary to receive at least one primary care service from an aco participant\n revised definitions of primary care for use in beneficiary assignment\n in accordance with provisions of the 21st century cures act and bba 2018, for performance years 2019 and thereafter, cms proposes to update the definition of primary care services that is used when assigning beneficiaries to acos (in combination with the applicable mssp track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assignment methodology).  services that would satisfy the revised definition include some existing current procedural terminology (cpt) codes (e.g., advance care planning) and healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) g-codes (e.g., depression screening) along with new g-codes proposed elsewhere in the rule (e.g., complexity inherent in office visits for certain specialties). cms also proposes to more accurately distinguish short-term, rehabilitation-related evaluation and management services provided in nursing facilities from ongoing primary care services furnished to longer-term nursing facility residents.  cms would identify the former services by linking the appropriate cpt codes to nursing facility claims for the same dates of service rather than relying on the place of service code for snfs (code 31) as listed on the professional claim.  avera supports the changes as proposed and agrees with cms that linking snf facility claims by date of service to professional claims will better identify short- term, rehabilitation-focused care that should not be counted as primary care services that contribute to beneficiary assignment to acos.\n promoting interoperability (pi)\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 13 of 13\n\n through two actions that would become effective january 1, 2019: 1) retiring the aco-11 measure (use of certified electronic health record technology (cehrt)); and 2) requiring instead certification by each aco that the level of cehrt usage by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clinicians meets or exceeds the advanced apm cehrt threshold under the qpp.  the latter requirement would become a condition of participation for all mssp tracks, and all payment models within those tracks, that also meet the financial risk standard required of advanced apms.  avera supports both of these proposed actions regarding aco cehrt usage and appreciates the associated burden reduction for acos and their clinicians.  however, the first change as proposed could potentially create disparate scoring standards for the promoting interoperability category in mips for aco clinicians that are not an advanced apm or do not meet the thresholds to be considered a qualifying participant. while the aco requirement is that clinicians would only have to certify cehrt usage, the mips requirement would require clinicians to actually submit pi data for scoring using mips-apm scoring standard.  avera requests that cms avoid creating confusion by confirming that clinicians in acos that are mips apms would not be subject to full pi category reporting and scoring but instead could simply certify their cehrt usage.  the pi category weight for such clinicians would then be redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories.\n in closing, avera appreciates the opportunity to submit these comments on the medicare shared savings program pathways to success proposed rule. we look forward to working with you on these and other issues that continue to challenge and strengthen our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care. if you have any questions about these comments or need

organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success\u00e2\u0080\u009d 83 fed. reg. 41786 (august 17, 2018)\n dear administrator verma: this letter is submitted on behalf of the american medical rehabilitation providers association (amrpa) regarding the medicare shared savings program (mssp) accountable care organizations (acos) proposed rule, published in the federal register on august 17, 2018. amrpa is the national trade association representing more than 625 freestanding inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units of general hospitals (collectively referred to as inpatient rehabilitation facilities (irfs) by medicare), outpatient rehabilitation service providers, long-term care hospitals (ltchs), and several skilled nursing facilities (snfs).\n inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and units (irh/us) provide hospital-level care, which is significantly different in intensity, capacity, and outcomes from post-acute care (pac) provided in non-hospital settings. amrpa members help their patients maximize their health, functional ability, independence, and participation in society so they are able to return to home, work, or an active retirement. the vast majority of our members are medicare participating providers and, on average, medicare part a payments represent more than 60 percent of irh/u revenues. 1 in 2016, irh/us served approximately 350,000 medicare beneficiaries, representing more than 391,000 stays. 2\n we appreciate the opportunity to provide comments to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) regarding the mssp acos, which constitute the most expansive of the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value-driven alternative payment models (apms). amrpa has a demonstrated track record of supporting cms in its pursuit of better alignment between incentives and high-value care\n page 2 of 9\n delivery. we have continued to engage with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s various initiatives for care and payment model innovations, providing comments on the episode payment models (epms) and comprehensive care for joint replacement (cjr) rules, the health care payment learning and action network (hcp lan) white papers, the cms innovation center\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew directions\u00e2\u0080\u009d request for information, and most recently, the announcement of the bundled payments for care improvement advanced (bpci-advanced) model. while we commend cms for considering innovative proposed changes to the mssp beneficiary attribution policy and the beneficiary incentive program, we are concerned about the accelerated \u00e2\u0080\u009cglide path\u00e2\u0080\u009d for acos to bear downside risk and the potential negative impact this would have on the medicare beneficiaries our members treat.\ni. unintended consequences of accelerating to two-sided risk  \n cms proposes to fast-track the pathway for mssp acos to assume financial risk by limiting the time in a one-sided risk model from the current six years to two years. cms also proposes to reduce the shared savings rate in half for one-sided risk acos from 50 percent to 25 percent. taken in combination, these proposals starkly intensify the financial risk\u00e2\u0080\u0094and instability\u00e2\u0080\u0094acos will experience. amrpa is concerned that these financial pressures will cause acos to inappropriately focus on cutting costs over achieving high-quality outcomes, and consequently jeopardize beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 access to pac.\n\na. acos limit access to post-acute care \n there is already evidence that the inherent conflict between the objectives of the mssp (reduce unnecessary care and spending) and those of hospital-led acos (maintain admission volumes) has resulted in diminished access to medically necessary pac. earlier this year, the medicare payment advisory commission (medpac) remarked that mssp acos generate savings not by reducing inpatient admissions, but through lowering utilization of other services such as outpatient facilities and professional services, imaging, tests, and pac in particular. notably, medpac concluded that it is attenuated pac use\u00e2\u0080\u0094not fewer hospital admissions\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary source\u00e2\u0080\u009d of savings for mssp acos. 3 both hospital-led and physician group-led acos, however, have dramatically limited their pac utilization. 4\n acos are restricting the amount, duration, and scope of rehabilitation services: our members report that acos in their markets have adopted pac management strategies that restrict access to certain settings secondary to cost considerations only. furthermore, some acos have developed total pac spending targets which limit admissions to certain pac settings. unfortunately, it is relatively easy for acos to reduce their overall spending by diverting patients away from pac delivered in institutional settings such as rehabilitation hospitals and shift patients to lower-intensity pac settings. needless to say, such care management strategies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with spending targets that are administratively derived\n page 3 of 9\n from retrospective claims data \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are pronouncedly divorced from patient-centered decision-making that addresses the clinical needs of the patient at hand.\n\nb. value-based care must prioritize functional outcomes \n any apm without adequate quality safeguards carries the risk of incentivizing providers to limit costs and stint on care instead of prioritizing patient well-being, functional outcomes, and quality of life. the pursuit of value-based care, in which \u00e2\u0080\u009cvalue\u00e2\u0080\u009d is defined as outcomes divided by cost, can only be as robust as the outcomes and costs data available to make that assessment. achieving and maintaining functional ability is a critically valuable outcome to patients and yet cms has unfortunately declined to enhance or include robust functional outcome measures in the mssp. amrpa has previously urged the agency to enhance functional status quality measures for the aco quality measure set, as well as those in numerous other programs.5 functional status is also a clear driver of a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resource utilization. research has shown functional status to significantly outperform comorbidities as a predictor of a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likelihood for readmissions following hospital discharge. 6 furthermore, the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (irf pps) is predicated upon the causal relationship between a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level of function and their resource use, and sets a precedent for cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recognition of this relationship.\n if cms wants to ensure the most relevant health outcomes are tracked, it should require acos and all apms to evaluate beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 functional status, functional improvement, and the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to sustain these improvements over longer periods of time. medicare reforms should be built upon a solid evidentiary base that prioritizes patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 well-being above all and certainly above pure cost-containment. it would be short-sighted for cms to enact policies that incentivize providers to focus more on generating savings in the short term rather than achieving high-quality patient outcomes in the long term, especially as better health outcomes lead to greater savings over the longer term.\n amrpa remains concerned that the pathway proposed in this rule would worsen the dynamics through which acos are delivering on costs savings, i.e., by reducing pac services, and without adequate quality measures to counterbalance any stinting of care. we also find it concerning that, in seeking to fast-track the mssp as proposed, cms disregards external input suggesting that such changes are counter to the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s viability. 7\n\n page 4 of 9\n amrpa recommends that cms not finalize its proposals to accelerate the pathway for acos to bear greater financial risk. we urge cms to instead focus on enhancing and evaluating the mssp framework to ensure that the program is delivering on its objectives of improving or, at a minimum, maintaining the quality of beneficiary outcomes.\n\nii. enhancing beneficiary notification and engagement  \n\n\na. beneficiary notification changes \n cms proposes to modify the current mssp beneficiary notification requirements to require a standard written notification that would be provided annually to each aco- attributed beneficiary at their first primary care visit of the performance year. amrpa strongly supports this proposal. aco providers should be required to disclose to beneficiaries that they are participating in an aco and be transparent in explaining how this will impact their care. our members report that, under the current notification processes, many patients who arrive at pac are not aware that they are in an aco or that their care options are affected by this fact. hence a written notification would enable providers to inform beneficiaries about the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care model. it could also encourage a conversation about what \u00e2\u0080\u009ccosts\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cquality\u00e2\u0080\u009d mean to the patient and help acos provide treatment that is tailored to the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique values and circumstances. cms should foster any dialogue that orients care to being truly patient-centered.\n for the mssp to be successful for all parties, but especially for patients and their families/caregivers, patients must have full confidence that the decisions being made about their care are indeed in their best interests. while there is limited literature to date regarding the patient/caregiver perspective experience under acos, results from other capitated payment delivery models show that providers have significant room for improvement in this area. for instance, hospitals participating in the bpci program have not been satisfactorily transparent or timely in their patient interactions. this includes not communicating to patients that their care will be provided under an alternative payment environment and the financial implications therein or not providing a thorough list of the post-discharge care options with meaningful information on the quality of care available. 8,9 it is imperative for cms to ensure that medicare beneficiaries understand their freedom of choice when they are placed in a model in which one entity bears financial risk for the total cost of care across multiple provider settings.\n\n\n\n page 5 of 9\n to address these concerns, we recommend that: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms adopt its proposal requiring that mssp acos notify beneficiaries of their inclusion in the aco at their first primary care visit. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms should also require acos to notify beneficiaries as early as possible, and along each step of the care continuum . this should include a notice to beneficiaries that they retain freedom of choice under medicare ffs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms should require acos to provide beneficiaries with a list of all available pac providers (irh/us, snfs, ltchs, and home health agencies) in their service area as part of the discharge planning process . the list should distinguish between those providers who are included or not included in any affiliated provider network used by the aco. beneficiaries should also be informed as to the differences in the quality and intensity of care, capacity, and out-of-pocket costs among their various pac options .\n\nb. changes to beneficiary attribution methodologies \n cms proposes changes to the beneficiary attribution processes to allow beneficiaries to designate or \u00e2\u0080\u009celect\u00e2\u0080\u009d their attribution to an aco. specifically, cms proposes to permit beneficiaries to voluntarily identify an aco professional as their primary care provider, and cms also proposes to create a beneficiary \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d method. amrpa supports adopting these revisions to the beneficiary attribution methodologies. similar to our comments above, we are wholly supportive of policies that engage patients and give them greater agency in directing their care choices.\n\nc. creating a beneficiary incentive program \n cms proposes to allow acos in track 2, levels c, d, or e of the basic track, or the enhanced track to establish a beneficiary incentive program for eligible beneficiaries. cms proposes to limit the value of services/items furnished under the incentive program to $20 per qualifying service/item. amrpa supports permitting acos to establish a beneficiary incentive program, as an appropriately developed program will help patients adhere to a prescribed course of treatment. transportation vouchers, for example, could greatly facilitate patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 adherence to an outpatient therapy regimen. while acos should be able to notify beneficiaries of these incentives, amrpa recommends that acos use template language supplied by cms regarding the availability of an incentive program. we additionally request that cms clarify if the incentive payments are limited in any way per program year ( e.g. , a maximum of x incentive payments per beneficiary, or per physician).\n\niii. waivers \n\n\na. snf three-day stay rule \n page 6 of 9\n amrpa believes cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 criteria for waiving the snf three-day rule overlooks the actual quality of care the beneficiary accessing a snf may receive. earning a three-star rating from cms alone is insufficient evidence of a snf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s readiness to treat patients on arrival from a three-day or less stay at an acute care hospital. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 snf five-star quality rating system is based on three criteria; one of the three levels\u00e2\u0080\u0094quality statistics\u00e2\u0080\u0094is self-reported by snfs and accepted by medicare without verification, and another level\u00e2\u0080\u0094staffing levels\u00e2\u0080\u0094only stopped being self-reported for snfs this past spring. 10 an investigation of the snf five-star quality rating system by the new york times found only one of the criteria for which snfs can earn stars, the results of annual health inspections, to be derived from assessments by independent reviewers. 11 generally, snfs have been, and continue to be, the subject of hhs reports highlighting failure to meet minimum quality of care standards. 12 for example, a 2014 report found as many as 22 percent of snf residents experience adverse events during their stays; physician reviewers determined as many as 59 percent of these adverse and temporary harm events were preventable. 13 just last month, the government accountability office (gao) testified before congress that between 2005 to 2014, there has been a 21 percent increase in the average number of consumer complaints per nursing home, and a 41 percent increase in the number of serious deficiencies\u00e2\u0080\u0094deficiencies that, at a minimum, caused harm to the resident. 14 additionally, snfs generally have high acute care hospital readmission rates, and are only beginning to be held accountable for their patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hospital readmission rates through cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 implementation of 30-day hospital readmission payment penalties. furthermore, snfs, unlike hospital-levels of care, are not required to have an on-site pharmacy and may not have adequate medical staff capacity and infrastructure to properly serve the full range of patients . amrpa remains concerned about cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to expand the snf three-day stay waiver in this rule. most acos would be eligible for the waiver after two years under the mssp, if not sooner, due to the accelerated pace to two-sided risk. we urge cms to comprehensively evaluate how the three-day rule waiver has impacted patient outcomes in the program to date before seeking to further expand waiver eligibility.\n\n page 7 of 9\n\n\nb. telehealth  \n cms proposes to waive the telehealth \u00e2\u0080\u009coriginating site of service\u00e2\u0080\u009d requirement and related geographic restrictions for certain telehealth services furnished by a physician or practitioner participating in an applicable aco. amrpa supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 adoption of these proposals and additionally recommends that cms monitor the impact of telehealth services on patient outcomes.\n\niv. irh/us need alternative reimbursement/pricing and regulatory flexibility \n cms has encouraged irh/us to participate in apms such as acos. however, medicare reimbursement for rehabilitation hospital services is very rigid, with a fixed per-patient discharge prospective payment system based largely on factors outside of the irh/u\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control, e.g. , principal diagnosis in the preceding hospitalization. in contrast, other pac providers have a greater degree of control over their medicare costs, namely through reducing their \u00e2\u0080\u009cunits\u00e2\u0080\u009d of utilization in either a per diem payment system (nursing homes) or a fixed-length episodic payment system (home health). although irh/us are encouraged to collaborate with acos on delivering efficient medicare spending, they are not given sufficient flexibility to adjust the costs associated with the resources used. to facilitate innovative care delivery, cms should grant irh/us the flexibility to be responsive to market-based dynamics and not be constrained by an inelastic medicare fee structure that effectively prices them out of apms. in promulgating the final rule, amrpa urges cms to make a number of modifications as described below. in addition to pricing flexibility, cms clearly retains the regulatory authority to waive some or all of the restrictive requirements in the context of these models, and the agency has made similar concessions for other providers. although cms waived the significant and well-established snf three-day stay rule, the agency has been unwilling to waive certain regulatory requirements that must be relaxed to facilitate irh/u participation in the mssp. accordingly, various regulatory requirements should be waived in the context of specific apms to allow irh/us to more effectively participate.\na. alternative reimbursement/pricing \n since acos are held responsible for pac spending, this encourages irh/us, and other pac providers, to produce high-quality outcomes at a reduced cost. unlike some other pac providers, however, rehabilitation hospitals are paid on a per-discharge basis for patients and medicare rules do not allow irh/us to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharge less\u00e2\u0080\u009d in this context. acos therefore are incentivized to steer patients away from receiving hospital-level rehabilitation, even when it is imperative to patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recovery.\n page 8 of 9\n negative for the majority of irh/us, 15 pricing flexibility must be voluntary, as should all alternative payment and care delivery concepts being tested.\n\nb. regulatory flexibility \n it is critical for irh/us to have sufficient regulatory flexibility to ensure they are able to deliver appropriate care in the apm context. amrpa recommends that cms relax the irh/u intensity of therapy standard for those apm cases for which the provider has elected to receive reduced reimbursement. specifically, the so-called three-hour rule (which cms has traditionally interpreted to rigidly require three hours of intensive individualized therapy each day for five days per week that a patient is in an irh/u) should not apply to cases for which the irh/u has elected to receive reduced reimbursement under an apm framework.\n in addition, cms should afford irh/us the option of including patients admitted under an apm as counting towards the irh/u\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compliance with the 60 percent rule. unlike other hospitals participating in medicare, in order for irh/us to receive payment under their prospective payment system, they must have a patient mix that fits a very specific criterion. known as the \u00e2\u0080\u009c60 percent rule,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the regulation mandates that 60 percent of all irh/u patients (across all payers) must have diagnoses derived from 13 medical conditions. the list of 13 conditions is extremely outdated, having been expanded only once since its inception in 1975 (from 10 to 13 conditions), and limits irh/us ability to evolve with the ever-changing medical treatment landscape. innovations and advances in medicine over the past four decades have enabled patients with other serious diagnoses to not only survive acute care hospitalizations, but to also benefit tremendously from the intensive and multidisciplinary rehabilitation program provided in irh/us. however, these patients are often denied admission because they do not meet 60 percent rule compliance. we ask that cms grant irh/us the option of counting patients admitted under acos towards their fulfillment of the 60 percent rule; this would afford irh/us the much-needed regulatory flexibility to more fully participate in alternative care and payment delivery models.\n these approaches are consistent with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recent emphasis on expanding provider access to apms, and has been favorably discussed by medpac in the context of reforming and advancing medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post-acute care payment systems. cms has the authority to permit such flexibility, and to waive these bureaucratic requirements without congressional approval; the agency should do so both in the final rule and when promulgating any future models or changes to the current programs.\n\nc. administrative presumption of medicare coverage under acos \n all patients admitted to irh/us from referring providers in an aco, regardless of whether the irh/u is receiving irf pps rates or reduced reimbursement, should be presumed to be covered in the rehabilitation hospital setting. specifically, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 contractors should not be permitted to deny payment for cases treated under acos\n page 9 of 9\n based on pre-payment review or post-payment reopening, unless there is evidence of fraud. acos are responsible for the cost and quality of care for their attributed beneficiaries are already held accountable for their pac placement decisions by virtue of their financial and quality performance. hence if a mssp aco chooses to discharge patients to an irh/u, they should have full discretion to do so without medicare contractor interference. cms should instruct its contractors to respect an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pac placement and utilization determinations.\n amrpa urges cms to introduce more regulatory flexibility, such as allowing alternative pricing, relaxing siloed regulatory requirements, and presuming irh/u coverage to allow for irh/us to fully participate in cms efforts to create a more efficient medicare system.\n *  *  *\n amrpa members are committed to medicare innovations that place patients back at

waiver. we agree with the expansion to include swing beds but feel additional changes to reduce administrative burden are needed.\r\nunderstanding that the current administration would like to reduce burden for healthcare providers to provide the right level of care at the right time, the suggestion presented is aimed to help reduce aco, physician and beneficiary burden currently experienced when utilizing a snf 3-day waiver as authorized under section 1115a(d)(1) of the act to waive section 1861(i) of the act for the track 1+ model, consistent with the snf 3-day rule waiver under 42 cfr 425.612. currently under this regulation one of the criteria to utilize a snf 3-day waiver states that the beneficiary have been evaluated and approved for admission to the snf within three days prior to the snf admission by an aco provider/supplier who is a physician, consistent with the aco's beneficiary evaluation and admission plan. this piece of the regulation has extremely increased the amount of administrative burden to the aco and the beneficiary in several ways, but we are most often affected when eligible medicare beneficiaries are seen in an emergency room, in a hospital under observation status or post-surgical procedure not requiring a 3-day hospital admission and have been evaluated by a physician but the evaluating provider is not an aco provider/supplier due the contracted billing relationship. some of our aco hospitals contract with outside agencies to supply emergency room or other providers. in these cases, the physicians do not bill under a aco participating tin, therefore are not an aco provider/supplier who can authorize a snf admission under the current snf 3-day waiver rule. this can cause a delay in care for patients who truly have a skilled or rehabilitation need as the aco care coordinators attempt to have the patient seen by an aco physician to reevaluate them and sign the snf 3-day waiver authorization form. this process also increases the cost of care by adding charges for the additional exam to assure the rules of the waiver are followed. the same type of scenario happens when beneficiaries are seen by advanced practitioners such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants who are on the aco provider supplier list. under the current rule, a physician must have seen the patient in the past three days to authorize the snf waiver admission. this is not always possible, especially in our smaller rural clinics when the supervising physician may not currently be on site at the time of the patients appointment. keystone aco has had much success utilizing the snf 3-day waiver, but feel changing the rule to remove the requirement that an aco physician must see the beneficiary within 3 days prior to snf waiver authorization would reduce a great amount of administrative and cost burden for the aco, the beneficiary and medicare.     \r\n     ", "0443": "please see attached from the bjc aco, llc,

believe that such practices would be inevitable under a opt-in model, would inevitably undermine the core goals of the mssp, and therefore the proposal should be withdrawn indefinitely. should cms decide to move forward with some kind of opt-in assignment scheme, it should extend the same courtesy to acos and permit them to utilize this methodology voluntarily, and develop safeguards to prevent opt-in based acos from \"poaching\" patients from competing acos with non-care driven tactics. beneficiary engagement beneficiary notifications cms proposes several changes to the requirement that acos notify their assigned beneficiaries of their participation in the mssp, and proposes to strengthen beneficiaries ability to voluntarily align themselves with an aco by designating an aco-participating clinician as their primary care provider, as required under section 50331 of the bipartisan budget act of 2018 (`the act\").1\u00e2\u00b0  consistent with the act, cms proposes to reintroduce the annual requirement that an aco-participating clinician provide beneficiaries with a notification (to be provided by cms as a template form) at their first primary care visit of each performance year, explaining the program and the beneficiary's rights as a participant, including to voluntarily align with an aco by designating a participating clinician as responsible for their care (including a physician/aco other than the one providing the notification). this new requirement would be in addition to current requirements to post signs and have written notices available upon request. bjc urges cms to withdraw this proposal for the same reasons the original annual notification requirement was eliminated the first lime (in 2015)\u00e2\u0080\u0094it only creates more confusion for patients and unnecessary burden for providers, even with, or perhaps more so because of, cms's template language!' bjc recommends that cms instead revise 42 cfr 425.312(c) to remove the designation of these notices as \"marketing materials,\" and instead permit acos to communicate basic mssp information to their beneficiaries in whatever manner seems most appropriate, including the already required posters and on-demand notices. cms should undertake its own efforts to educate medicare beneficiaries on the mssp generally, including their right to voluntarily align with an aco (or not). at the very least, cms should just leave the current notification standards in place. beneficiary incentive payments pursuant to section 50341 of the act, cms proposes to permit certain acos to establish a beneficiary incentive payment program, whereby acos would pay their beneficiaries a nominal amount for engaging in certain qualifying activities!' as cms notes, several anti-kickback

medicare & medicaid services department of health and human services attention: cms-1701-p\n re: medicare program: medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success\n dear administrator verma,\n on behalf of the center for medication optimization (cmo) at the unc eshelman school of pharmacy, i applaud the centers for medicare & medicaid services for engaging stakeholders to discuss ways in which the medicare shared savings program can be improved. i am writing to respectfully submit our response to the request for comments related to the coordination of pharmacy care for aco beneficiaries, outlined on pages 41911-41912.\n this section specifically solicits comments related to the following questions:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 how can acos and part d plans work together to improve coordination of pharmacy services? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 how can cms, medicare acos and part d sponsors structure the financial terms of these arrangements to reward part d sponsors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 contributions towards achieving program goals, including improving the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coordination of care?\n at the center for medication optimization, we strive to conduct impactful, real-world research, and to generate evidence that demonstrates the value that medications bring in meeting healthcare quality and cost goals. through our professional experiences as pharmacists and through the research we conduct, we have come to understand the challenges that fragmented care and medication mismanagement can pose to optimized healthcare, including the deleterious effects on total cost of care and patient quality of life. as such, we are committed to examining evidence-based solutions to these issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. how can acos and part d plans work together to improve coordination of pharmacy services?  \n\n cmo encourages cms to consider medication management as a critical potential modifier of health status, to adopt principles implemented in the enhanced medication therapy management model,1 to bolster the use of pharmacists as a primary point of intersection between acos and part d plans, and to increase the availability of reciprocal and timely access to clinical and pharmacy data.\n\na. recognition of the importance of medications  \n\n currently, the value of medications in meeting both cost and quality goals is not fully recognized in the medicare shared savings program, as indicated by the lack of inclusion of prescription drug costs in the aco total cost of care calculus. this is in opposition to previous acts by cms that have recognized the importance of medications, for example, medication-related mips performance measures can make up to 50% of the mips composite score for certain performance categories.2 the separation of medicare parts a, b and d creates artificial divisions and does not acknowledge the important role that medications play in healthcare. in fact, 75 percent of physician visits, 72 percent of outpatient hospital visits, and 80 percent of er visits involve drug therapy.3 further, nearly 1/3 of adverse events leading to hospitalizations are associated with medications and greater than $300 billion is spent each year on the misuse, underuse, and overuse of medications.4,5 these findings highlight the enormous opportunity that holding organizations accountable for optimizing medication therapy can have on both healthcare utilization and costs.\n\nb. adoption of principles from the enhanced medication therapy management model \n\n at present, all part d plans must establish a medication therapy management (mtm) program that ensures that covered drugs are optimally used, however, the benefits of these programs have been less than ideal due to a system that \u00e2\u0080\u009cincentivizes investment in these activities only at a level necessary to meet the minimum compliance standards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d 6 this issue of misaligned incentives has prompted cms to investigate new approaches for ensuring appropriate medication use in the part d program. since the government provides direct subsidies to part d plans, it is in the interest of the government to align part d services with the cost saving objectives of cms.\n in response, the effects of a well-funded mtm program are being explored through the enhanced medication therapy management model.7 this demonstration provides stand-alone part d plans with\n increased regulatory flexibility, as well as financial incentives to invest in their medication management programs. in return, part d plans receive performance-based payments for contributing to a reduction in >2% fee-for-service expenditure if certain quality standards are also met. in this program, part d plans are able to better target patients to remove barriers to proper medication use at the individual level, develop their own risk-stratified criteria for targeting, and utilize enhanced and different engagement techniques with beneficiaries.8 we support the adoptions of principals from the enhanced mtm program to the aco-part d plan collaboration, namely, performance-based payments for contributions to reduction in fee-for-service expenditure, enhanced investment in the integration of pharmacists in physician medication management workflows, regulatory flexibility to develop risk- stratified criteria for better patient targeting, and the allowance of different patient engagement and communication strategies.\n\nc. encouraging integration of pharmacists as intermediaries between acos and part d sponsors \n\n pharmacists are medication experts, located conveniently in virtually every community in the u.s. approximately 89% of the population lives within 5 miles of a pharmacy.9 pharmacists are usually the last line of protection, regularly providing advice directly to patients, checking for adverse events, navigating coverage issues, and consulting with physicians on medication related issues. these services are vitally important considering that prescription medications are the primary tools used to treat both chronic and acute conditions to improve health.10 pharmacists are also trusted within the communities they serve and are skilled at communicating relevant drug information with patients, including costs. consequently, pharmacists have been delegated as the primary providers of medication therapy management delivery, with 100% of part d plans indicating that they have pharmacists performing mtms in 2018.11 with knowledge of the patient perspective, pharmacists can also be used to work closely with providers to develop effective ways to systematically weigh the costs of drugs with the clinical benefit. therefore, as acos become more experienced, we encourage cms to consider ways to incentivize including pharmacists in the design of clinical drug utilization management strategies with the following goals:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increase collaboration between acos and part d plans, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increase medication adherence, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 reduce adverse events, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 improve medication prescribing appropriateness, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 improve clinical health outcomes, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 reduce preventable healthcare utilization, and\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 reduce total cost of care. 12\n\nd. increasing the availability of reciprocal and timely access to clinical and pharmacy data \n\n the identification and resolution of medication-related issues and their effects on healthcare utilization cannot be accomplished without reciprocal, timely access to real-time clinical and pharmacy data. often, prescribers lack reliable information regarding which drugs their patients are actually taking, and part d plans lack information on medicare parts a and b utilization to guide effective targeting of high- risk patients, as only 3.3% of stand-alone prescription drug plans use medical data to identify eligible beneficiaries.13  we recommend this become a priority as it will:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 foster better prescribing by providers, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 reduce the number of inappropriate medications taken, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 allow for more cost-effective medication substitutions, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 allow for the monitoring of patients to identify non-adherence, and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 enable pharmacies to target high-risk patients/safety issues.\n we acknowledge the challenges arising from differing health it systems and poor interoperability, and encourage cms to facilitate transmitting secure and relevant data. this principal is also currently being explored through the enhanced medication therapy management model, where part d sponsors may request medicare a and b spending data so as to refine their targeting approach and to better track the effects of their interventions.\n\n2. how can cms, medicare acos and part d sponsors structure the financial terms of these \n arrangements to reward part d sponsors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 contributions towards achieving program goals, including improving the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coordination of care?\n cmo encourages cms to realign incentives in the part d plans so that savings in fee-for-service resulting from improved adherence and reduced healthcare utilization can be shared with both part d plans and mtm providers.\n\na. realigning incentives so part d plans may share in savings derived from improved drug \n management\n since 70% of beneficiaries assigned to acos participating in the shared savings program had continuous part d coverage in 2016, we believe that part d sponsors could play a greater role in coordinating the care of their enrolled medicare ffs beneficiaries and have greater accountability for their overall health outcomes. however, stand-alone part d plans who are solely responsible for drug expenditures, do not\n get credit for reducing medicare part a and b utilization. in fact, without exposure to increases in part a and b utilization, stand-alone part d plans have limited understanding or accountability for how their policies impact overall cost. to encourage greater engagement, adequate incentives must be in place, therefore, we support rewarding part d plans, beyond star ratings, for producing positive outcomes through their adherence programs. this will also have the added downstream benefit of encouraging part d plans to further strengthen their medication management programs.\n in summary, we are appreciative for the opportunity to share our input as pharmacists and as researchers. we believe that collaboration is in the best interest of all parties in that better stewardship of prescription drugs will result in lower healthcare utilization, smarter drug spending, and most importantly, improved patient health outcomes. we stand ready to assist and welcome further discourse.\n respectfully,\n\n\n\n amber b. ray, pharmd, mph post-doctoral fellow in

proposed rule. coastal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main concern with the proposed rule is the walk-back on the timing and the quantitative impact of regional benchmarking.  what we appreciate most in the proposed rule is that the revenue-based downside risk model embedded in the current track 1+ is preserved in the new basic level e option.\ncoastal is a single-tin primary care driven aco. coastal entered the mssp in july 2012 and has worked diligently to transform the experience of care for patients, improve quality, and lower total cost of care.  our performance in these areas has been very strong.  we are grateful that the mssp has provided the resources that have enabled us to do this important work.  we also believe that the mssp has been a catalyst in the market, influencing commercial and medicare advantage payers to offer us similar payment models to the mssp.  these opportunities have been important to our all-payer approach to transforming our clinical and business models. we are also appreciative of the support that has accrued to our work through our participation in track 2 of the cpc+ program.\nthe clinical model for population health management today at coastal is characterized by an array of centralized clinical programs and administrative supports overlaid on a foundation of advanced primary care.  centralized teams support the individual primary care offices by managing transitions of care, assisting with quality improvement, refilling prescriptions, providing disease management programs (diabetes, chf, copd), offering after-hours weekend and holiday access for urgent primary care, offering home visits to patients with challenges in coming to the office, offering nurse care management in the hospital and nursing home, and providing clinical pharmacy services to support medication therapy management, opiate stewardship, antibiotic stewardship, and other initiatives.  centralized it and data analytics teams are foundational to our work on quality improvement, population segmentation, variation reduction, incentive compensation, financial forecasting, and performance measurement.\nexecuting on the above has required that coastal take substantial investment risk.  we are spending more to save more.\nnaacos data indicate our pmpy cost is 17% lower than the average for other aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in our region. in this setting, reducing the maximum weight used in calculating the regional adjustment from 70 to 50 percent, capping the regional adjustment at 5% of national ffs expenditures, and extending agreement periods to 5 years while incrementally introducing regional benchmarking all reduce the payments coastal will receive for cost-efficient performance.  this will create at least three different problems for us:\n1.\twe use a high percentage of shared savings payments to cover the incremental costs of accountable care. in any given year, our margins can be small. these rule changes, if finalized, will make our commitment to accountable care less sustainable and less secure.\n2.\tthese changes if finalized will bring home a hard lesson that the rules of the game can change at any time in a way that may disadvantage us. a rational response would be to reduce our tolerance for investment risk. this will slow the pace of transformation and innovation.\n3.\tthe mssp appears to be balancing pay for improvement vs. pay for achievement re: managing total cost of care. pay for improvement is a rational policy at many levels, but it distorts competition.  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s we compete within our market are earning sizable payments for improvement and are offering substantial bonuses to their physicians.  we are saving more than such competitors, but we are earning less because we are competing against our own historical cost performance. this puts us at a competitive disadvantage and inhibits our growth.\nthank you for your consideration of these comments and for your support of

from. because of the rural nature of the facility, we maintain accreditation as a level iv trauma center, as well as preparedness to treat medical emergencies such as heart attacks, strokes, and other life-threatening emergencies. we also provide obstetrical services. the nearest referral hospital for trauma (a level ii trauma center) is 75 miles north. the nearest hospital with a cardiac

providers to continue to develop quality reporting skills in a risk-free reimbursement model.\n\n", "0449": "see attached file(s) october 16, 2018\nms. seema verma \n\nms. seema verma \n october 16,

approximately 2 percent higher1. for example, peer-reviewed studies found that the mssp saved more than $200 million in 2013 and 2014 and $144.6 million in 2015 after accounting for shared savings bonuses earned by acos2. a similar study found that acos saved $1.84 billion from 2013 through 2015 and reduced medicare spending by $542 million after accounting for shared savings bonuses3. premier firmly believes that the aco model is a successful approach for encouraging providers to work together to reduce costs and improve the quality of healthcare for medicare beneficiaries.\n supporting the movement to these value-based payment models goes beyond the quality and financial results of acos. from a market perspective, we will never achieve innovation in healthcare except through the creative power of healthcare providers seeking to innovate the care delivery process. models in which payers seek to achieve savings and quality improvement will always fall short until healthcare providers themselves are held accountable for the results. we have seen firsthand the remarkable innovations that are spurred by this accountability such as those in telehealth, the hospital in the home, special care centers, organizing community support organizations and systematically addressing the social determinates of health.\n the pathways to success establishes a step-wise approach for acos increasingly taking on more downside risk. premier agrees that it is imperative that over time providers become increasingly responsible for total cost of care through risk-bearing agreements; however, cms must ensure providers have proper tools and experience to achieve this vision. we believe that with proper incentives and improvements in the program organizations will take on risk, seeing the quality, clinical innovation and business benefit from doing so. specifically, cms should consider the following within the context of mssp and any new payment models:\n sufficient time in an upside-only model prior to moving to downside risk. acos are more likely to achieve shared savings with time. specifically, studies show that the shared savings rate doubles with three years of experience from 21 percent for acos in the first year to over 40 percent for acos in the third of fourth year4. accordingly, premier recommends at least 3 years in an upside only model for new acos entering the mssp. beyond the mssp program, premier believes it is imperative for cms to provide a long-term vision and roadmap for the transition to value-based and risk-based models. in the absence of a clear timeline, some providers are reluctant to embark on new models. when providers have a clear plan for moving to new models (e.g. the maryland all-payer model), providers work aggressively to succeed in the model and more rapidly advance to the risk-bearing model.\n high performers should be encouraged to participate in models regardless of provider type. the mssp performance data summarizes average aco performance, masking differences among high and low performers within each category. we strongly discourage the application of policies targeting provider types that are intended to modify the behavior of the lowest performers; these policies impact high and low performers, thereby disincentivizing high performers from continuing in the model and producing savings. specifically, we request that cms eliminate the distinction of high and low revenue acos and avoid creating new blunt tools to define acos (e.g. physician-led and hospital-led). in any payment model cms should create a level competitive playing field and let those that perform best succeed most. cms should find non-provider defined approaches to eliminate poor performers.\n\n\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 3 of 16\n\n\n ensure a business case for taking on risk. cms must ensure that acos and new payment models, particularly voluntary models, provide incentives for taking on risk. the existing models to date have ignored the significant investment costs required to start or continue participation in a model. even when these costs are not incorporated into the payment model, providers will consider potential return on investment when determining whether to enter a new model. cms must recognize this dynamic and ensure that acos and other models will attract providers. specifically, cms should:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increase the shared savings rate for acos to at least 50 percent. as discussed below reducing the savings rate prevents acos from recouping initial investments, reinvesting savings into population health activities, and recruiting providers with the use of gainsharing agreements.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 provide additional flexibility in the models for acos taking on risk. to be best suited to take on more risk, within an aco or any payment mode, and effectively manage the care of populations providers require flexibility. while beneficial, the current approaches to providing flexibility (e.g. snf and telehealth waivers, beneficiary incentive program) represent limited portions of medicare benefits and thus limited opportunities for transforming care. within the next generation aco model cms incorporated several options that provide flexibility and should be considered for inclusion in the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0094choice on enrolling tin or npi, infrastructure payment, prepayment of shared savings and primary capitation. similarly, cms should consider aspects of medicare advantage that could be incorporated into acos. while ma is a capitated full-risk model, providers would benefit from the flexibilities in performance-based risk models. specifically, cms should consider incorporating utilization management into acos and expanding on the beneficiary incentive payment by incorporating aspects of the ma value-based insurance design (vbid) model, allowing acos to offer supplemental benefits or reduced cost sharing to aligned beneficiaries with specified chronic conditions, focused on the services that are of highest clinical value to them.\n\n redesigning participation options to facilitate performance- based risk\n phase-in of performance-based risk in the basic track\n cms proposes to redesign the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance-based risk tracks by retiring track 1 (no risk, upside only) and track 2 and creating a new basic track. in the basic track, participants could begin participation in a one-sided risk model and phase-in risk over the course of a single agreement period; the highest level of risk is comparable to the current track 1+. additionally, the proposed rule retains track 3, renaming it as the enhanced track. eligible acos would enter into these two tracks for an agreement period of 5 years (the first agreement period, if stated in july 2019 would be 5 years and 6 months). within the basic track, cms proposes a glide path that includes 5 levels: a one-sided risk model available only for the first two consecutive performance years (levels a & b), and three levels of progressively higher risk and potential reward in performance years 3 through 5 of the agreement period (levels c, d, and e). acos would automatically advance at the start of each participation years along this glide path until they reach the track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maximum level of risk/reward (designed to be the same as the track 1+ model).\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 4 of 16 5https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180918.957502/full/?utm_term=half+a+decade+in%2c+medicare+accountable+ care+organizatio%e2%80%a6\n\n\n downside risk. numerous studies show that acos require about 3-4 years to become successful.5 this is not surprising given that acos receive feedback on their performance several months into their first agreement period\u00e2\u0080\u0095any initiatives designed to improve performance always take more time than anticipated, and this is particularly true for the complex organizations and agreements that comprise an\naco. under the current proposal, acos would have only one year of performance data before being \n required to move to a risk-based model. organizations need time to make the structural, cultural, and practice changes required to successfully manage and assume financial risk for a population. in recognition of the time required for acos to be successful, cms should allow at least three years of no-downside risk within the basic track to ensure the success of participating acos and encourage future participation. cms should extend an optional fourth year in a one-sided track for acos that achieve savings, not necessarily shared savings, across three performance periods and have high quality.\n shared savings rate\n premier strongly urges cms to set the entry-level risk for the basic track at 50 percent with gradual increases in the shared-savings rate as acos progress through the various levels. lowering the shared-savings rate for acos with no downside risk from 50 percent to 25 percent provides little incentive for new acos to join the program. the low shared-savings rate also does not consider the substantial investment needed on the part of acos. according to an analysis by the aha, the investment required to put in place and sustain the elements necessary for a successful aco has been $11.6 to\n$26.1 million higher than previous estimates by cms. these costs, coupled with the cost of having a \n repayment mechanism in place to cover losses, creates a high hurdle for organizations who are transitioning to accountable care.\n the proposed shared savings rate is a significant decrease for existing acos, which will be unable to reinvest savings back into population management and care coordination. shared savings payments are critical as part of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transformation toward value-based care and are necessary to incentivize providers to make the infrastructure investments needed to transform care delivery and processes. without them, acos will struggle to provide care and services needed to appropriately manage the health of the population and move more rapidly to risk, undermining the overall goal of the program. reducing shared savings also produces problems with provider participation and aco buy-in, as some organizations already find this difficult at current shared savings level. to incentivize acos to take on risk, cms should increase the shared-savings rates as acos take on additional risk. we recommend increasing the shared savings by 5 percent with each step: levels a/b: 50 percent; levels c/d: 55 percent; and level e: 60 percent.\n calculation of loss sharing limit\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 5 of 16\n\n\n benchmark. accordingly, increasing the benchmark-based loss limit creates an unlevel playing field for acos that include hospital participants this proposed policy is counter to the goal of acos to encourage providers to work together to improve care for beneficiaries and discourages both health-system led and physician-led acos from recruiting hospital participants.\n cms should allow all acos to remain in track e or whatever track meets the nominal risk requirements under qpp. if cms increases the qpp aapm nominal risk threshold, cms should create a glidepath in mssp for acos to transition to the new standard of risk.\n transition from level e to enhanced track\n premier urges cms to create additional levels within the enhanced track to build a more gradual transition from level e to enhanced. as proposed, many acos would not be eligible for the basic track or able to renew within the basic track for a second agreement period and would only have the option to enroll in the enhanced track. cms should either build a glide path to the highest risk level within the enhanced track or offer an additional track to help bridge the gap between the basic and enhanced tracks. to further maximize interest in acos transitioning to the enhacned track, cms should start the shared savings rate at 80 percent (same as the next generation aco program) and increase the maximum shared savings and losses rate over the agreement period.\n permitting annual participation elections\n annual risk election\n cms proposes to allow acos in the basic track to more rapidly transition (i.e., skip a level or levels) during the agreement period, but level e must be entered into no later than the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth performance year under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal. premier encourages cms to provide acos with more flexibility in their annual participation elections. if an aco selects a higher level of risk than it would have been automatically assigned, it should not be required to automatically advance the following year (i.e. an aco is not required to advance beyond the track they would have been assigned if they did not choose to advance to a higher track). as noted earlier, acos require additional time moving to risk. this option would provide acos the option to gain experience in a limited risk track for more than one year. additionally, we ask that cms consider allowing high performing acos more than one year in limited risk tracks (i.e. level c and d). cms could set parameters for successful acos to continue in a particular track prior to automatic advancing (i.e. achieving savings, not necessarily shared savings, and high quality).\n annual election of beneficiary assignment\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 6 of 16\n\n\n techniques from the start of the performance period on a population for whom they know they are responsible.\n determining participation options based on medicare ffs revenue and prior participation\n cms proposes to define participation options by making a distinction between low revenue acos and high revenue acos. high revenue acos are a proxy for acos that typically include a hospital billing through an aco participant tin; cms defines this as an aco whose total part a and b revenue for aco participants is greater than the total parts a and b expenditures for aco assigned beneficiaries. acos falling below this threshold are considered low-revenue acos, a proxy for physician group acos. cms believes that high revenue acos are more capable of accepting higher risk than low revenue acos. cms provides fewer participation options for high revenue acos. high revenue acos with \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d can only participate in the enhanced track regardless of whether they are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cre- entering\u00e2\u0080\u009d the program. in addition, low revenue (and inexperienced) acos may operate under the basic track for a maximum of two agreement periods, whereas high revenue acos are limited to one agreement period.\n premier strongly opposes this proposal and urges cms to eliminate the low/high revenue distinction for determining participation options. we firmly believe that all acos should the treated the same. this proposed distinction is unnecessary and harmful, as it would discourage acos that have the potential to generate substantial savings to the program from participating. the premise cms uses for hospital-led versus physician-led distinction is also flawed. cms argues that this policy decision is due in part to low revenue acos producing 2 percent of savings compared to 0.2 percent for high-revenue acos. a premier analysis of hospital-led vs. physician-led acos revealed two-major findings that refute this assumption: our analysis of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 definition of hospital-led (the aco includes a hospital tin participant) found that it is inaccurate with at least 20 percent of health system-led acos being designated as \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician led.\u00e2\u0080\u009d some of the highest performing individual acos are hospital-led acos. twenty-one premier acos in mssp track 1 have achieved savings in multiple years of the program while also maintain quality higher than the national average. should they, therefore, be advantaged over physician-led acos?\n cms argues that many low-revenue acos are not well-capitalized and therefore unable to absorb losses as well as high-revenue acos. regardless of structure, significant investments are needed in population health platforms and care process changes for acos to bear risk. medicare revenue is also not indicative of ability to bear risk. cms is unable to identify if an aco is well capitalized through sources outside of medicare revenue (i.e., insurer or investor backed acos). accordingly, cms is unable to truly identify whether an aco is well capitalized and thus should not create distinctions based on assumptions about capital. setting up a system that disadvantages hospital-led acos limits the types of innovations needed to build a high performing healthcare system for the range of communities across the nation.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 7 of 16\n\n\n clinicians. the greatest fear related to consolidation is its potential to lead to higher prices. ultimately, the only way to protect against escalating costs is to advance these alternative payment models that hold providers accountable and give them the opportunity to improve care and reduce costs for an entire population.\n premier believes that the goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients. the best way to drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate, to innovate, and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare. including a hospital is an effective way to balance the need for access to specialty care while increasing the focus on primary care. one might argue that an aco should require a hospital participant and other providers across the care continuum to ensure that acos do not simply keep patients away from a particular setting but ensure patients receive care in the least restrictive setting. while it would be absurd to define what providers an aco must include, it is equally absurd to say that acos that work to include multiple provider types should be forced to risk sooner.\n premier believes that healthy market competition relies on a level playing field. this administration has been outspoken in advocating for market solutions and level playing fields among competitors. this proposed policy, however, is contrary to a market-based approach whereby all competitors have similar opportunities for success. whenever there is an uneven playing field, one competitor will use it to their advantage over another. alternatively, competitors can take steps to game the system. advantaging one group over another can also create perverse incentives to undermine a competitor overall.\n defining participation options by \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cms also proposes to limit participations options by categorizing acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d with performance-based risk medicare aco initiatives and determining participation options based on prior participation of aco legal entities and aco participants. cms defines a \u00e2\u0080\u009cre- entering aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d as (1) the same legal entity as an aco, identified by tin, or a (2) new legal entity that has never participated in the mssp and is applying to participate in the program and more than 50 percent of its aco participants were included on the aco participant list. cms defines an experienced aco that meets either of the following criteria: (1) the aco is the same legal entity as a current or previous aco that is participating in, or has participated in, a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under track 2 or track 3; or (2) 40 percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or in an aco that deferred its entry into a mssp agreement period under track 2 or track 3, in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n premier supports the participation options based on prior participation and definitions of renewing/re-entering acos and the 50 percent threshold. we generally support the cms definition of experienced but urge cms to increase the threshold from 40 percent to 50 percent to align with the new/re-entering definition. we also encourage cms to monitor the impact of this policy and consider creating an appeals process. for example, it is possible that two separate acos discontinue operation in a region then a new entity, completely unaffiliated with either prior entity, forms in the region and recruits participants involved in the prior organization. the intent of the policy is to avoid gaming of the options for the glidepath not to discourage new entities. to balance this potential outcome, cms should also consider a second criteria, setting a threshold for a percentage of participants that previously were in the same entity. for example, cms would first identify if 50 percent of participants would qualify an aco to be reentering or experienced; then, if less than 30 percent of participants were part of the same legal entity, the aco could appeal the label of reentering or experienced.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 8 of 16\n\n\n\n cms proposes additional provisions to address an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial performance when an aco may otherwise be in compliance with program requirements. cms states that just as poor quality performance can subject an aco to remedial action or termination, an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to lower growth in medicare ffs expenditures should be the basis for cms to take pre-termination actions. these actions could include a request for corrective action by the aco, or termination of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement. specifically, cms proposes to terminate acos if it is negative outside corridor for two agreement periods. cms appears to be particularly concerned about one-sided risk acos that continue to participate in the program and generate net losses to medicare.\n premier opposes the cms proposal to terminate acos if negative outside corridor for two agreement periods. we believe that these additional provisions, if implemented, would provide cms with too much discretion to terminate aco participation in the program. we are concerned that such unchecked authority provided to cms would further discourage acos participating in the mssp, as this would create additional uncertainty for participants and would also make it difficult to establish agreements with other organizations. moreover, cms proposals with respect to the glide path that would limit participation in one-sided risk models would also provide acos with incentives to leave the program if they were not able to generate savings.\n election of minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss rate (mlr) by acos\n cms proposes that acos under the basic track would have the same msr/mlr options that are currently available to acos under one-sided and two-side models of the mssp. acos under the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path in level a or level b would choose the msr/mlr to be applied before the start of their first performance year in a two-sided model. cms also proposes to use a variable msr/mlr when performing shared savings and shared losses if an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population falls below 5,000 for the performance year, regardless of whether the aco selected a fixed or variable msr/mlr. premier supports these proposals and appreciates the flexibility these options provide to meet acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs.\n participation options for agreement periods beginning in 2019\n cms proposes to offer a july 1, 2019 start date as the initial opportunity for acos to enter an agreement period under the basic or enhanced track. as proposed, acos that entered a first or second agreement period with a start date of january 1, 2016, may elect to extend their agreement period for an optional fourth performance year, defined as the six-month period from january 1, 2019 through june 30, 2019. cms notes that this election to extend the agreement period is voluntary and an aco could therefore conclude its participation in the program with the expiration of its current agreement period on december 31, 2018.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 9 of 16\n\n\n\n managing two distinct patient populations will require the aco to be responsible for the beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cost and quality during a time in which the aco is unable to manage the patient. as a result, acos will have to scale up resources and infrastructure for one performance period in order to mitigate the quality and cost impact. moreover, with little influence over beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expenditures outside of the performance period, acos could potentially be at risk for exceeding their benchmark. to mitigate this impact, cms should provide an option to allow acos in current models to extend their agreements for one year, resulting in a start date of january 1, 2020 for entering the new model. cms could still provide a july 1, 2019 start date option for new and existing acos. at a minimum, cms should use a singular assignment window and methodology to determine the assigned population for the entire calendar year 2019, regardless of whether they are in an extended agreement or the new model.\n finally, we are concerned that implementation issues could arise if cms rushes the application process, so we urge cms to ensure that there is enough time for cms and participants to prepare for an application cycle after the final rule. premier asks that cms delay the july 1, 2019 start and offer a one- year extension to all current acos who are ending their agreements if cms is not ready to implement a new model.\n benchmarking methodology refinements\n calculating growth rates used in establishing, resetting and updating the benchmark\n cms proposes to use what it refers to as a national-regional blend or a blend of national and regional growth rates to trend forward by1 and by2 to by3 when establishing or resetting an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical benchmark. cms would also use this approach to update the historical benchmark to the performance year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this would be calendar year 2019 for acos within the six-month performance period from july 1, 2019 to december 31, 2019. to calculate the national-regional blend, cms would calculate a weighted average of national ffs and regional trend factors, where the weight assigned to the national component would represent the share of assignable beneficiaries in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regional service area that are assigned to the aco. the weight assigned to the regional component would be equal to 1 minus the national weight. as an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s penetration in its region increases, a higher weight would be placed on the national component of the national-regional blend and a lower weight on the regional component, reducing the extent to which the trend factors reflect the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own expenditure history.\n premier appreciates that cms has responded to our previous concerns with solely a regional trend factor; however, we urge cms to adopt a policy premier and others have long recommended. that is, aco beneficiaries should be removed from the regional reference population. including the aco population in the reference population causes the aco to be compared to itself rather than the ffs medicare spending in the region. by including aco beneficiaries, the regional cost data incorporates efforts acos have made to reduce spending. as a result, benchmarks may diverge from the counterfactual spending, making it increasingly difficult for acos to achieve savings in comparison to the benchmark.\n use of regional factors when establishing and resetting acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benchmarks\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 10 of 16\n\n\n national per capita expenditures for parts a and b services in baseline year 3 for assignable beneficiaries).\n premier supports the cms proposal to incorporate the regional adjustment into the initial agreement period. we do not support lowering the regional contribution to below 50 percent and urge cms to maintain the current maximum contribution of 70 percent. as such we recommend the following schedule of weights to be applied:\n schedule of weights for regional adjustment timing when subject to regional adjustment aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical spending is lower than its region aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical spending is higher than its region first time 30% 25% second time 50% 35% third 70% 50% all subsequent periods 70% 70%\n premier also supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed policy to cap regional adjustment at 5 percent of national expenditures to control for outliers. cms should, however, provide additional flexibility to incentivize acos to take on more risk. cms should provide an option for acos to use national benchmarks (in lieu of regional) for risk-bearing acos. this would be more desirable for acos in historically low spend regions that believe their targets are too low to take on downside risk.\n risk adjustment methodology\n premier appreciates the risk adjustment refinements cms proposes that would eliminate the distinction of newly and continuously aligned beneficiaries for purposes of risk adjustment. this appropriately recognizes that risk scores should increase or decrease during the course of the agreement period and that the beneficiary population underlying health changes with time. we urge cms, however, to raise the cap as +/- 3 percent is too restrictive; +/- 5 percent would more accurately account for changes in risk over a performance period. ideally, cms should provide additional incentives for acos to move to higher risk levels by providing additional flexibility in accounting for the risk of the population. this could be accomplished by allowing the cap to increase as acos take on additional risk. level e in the basic track, for example, would have a higher cap than levels c and d. we also believe that the cap for the enhanced track should align with the percentage change in risk scores for ma plans.\n\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements\n skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver expansion\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 11 of 16\n\n\n\n telehealth waiver expansion\n in keeping with the provisions of the bipartisan budget act of 2018 (bba 2018), cms proposes that existing originating site and geographic restrictions would be waived when medicare-approved telehealth services are furnished to ffs beneficiaries by mssp aco professionals. the waiver would take effect beginning with performance year 2020 and be limited to those acos that bear performance-based risk and to whom beneficiaries are prospectively assigned. the services must be billed through the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tin and may not be designated as inpatient-only. the expanded telehealth policy would apply to track 3 and to track 1+ acos as well as to those on the newly proposed enhanced track and on levels c, d, and e of the basic track. premier strongly supports the telehealth expansion as proposed, particularly when combined with the increased flexibility that would occur with the proposed ability for acos to annually elect either prospective or preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment.\n other needed waivers\n premier notes once again that additional waivers are critical to removing persistent legal and regulatory barriers that inhibit mssp aco providers from working together to provide better-coordinated, high- quality care, most notably pertaining to the applicable fraud and abuse laws (e.g., the stark and anti- kickback statutes and the beneficiary inducements civil monetary penalty (cmp) provisions). premier continues to recommend that cms should issue: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an aco \u00e2\u0080\u009cpre-participation\u00e2\u0080\u009d waiver to protect aco-related start-up arrangements, in anticipation of new mssp participants and the proposed redesigned tracks; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an aco participation waiver that applies broadly to aco-related arrangements during the term of the participation agreement; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 a shared savings distributions waiver that applies to distributions and uses of any earned shared savings payments or internal costs savings.\n\n\n tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n beneficiary incentive program implementation\n beneficiaries assigned to mssp acos, regardless of assignment methodology, retain their rights to seek care outside of the aco without penalty. therefore, to effectively deliver value-based care, acos must seek to actively engage the beneficiaries for whom they will be held accountable for quality and cost; yet mssp acos are prohibited from marketing activities, such as those permitted for medicare advantage (ma) plans. current regulations do allow acos to provide in-kind items or services as incentives, the majority of which are judged on a case-by-case basis, but acos are inhibited by the simultaneously applicable statutes (e.g., anti-kickback and cmp provisions). the bba 2018 enables performance-based risk-bearing acos to establish incentive payment programs to encourage their assigned beneficiaries to obtain medically necessary primary care services, beginning no later than january 1, 2020. cms proposes implementing regulations, including aco eligibility and incentive program application and certification processes, with a start date of july 1, 2019 (coinciding with the first agreement period of the redesigned aco tracks). cms also addresses beneficiary eligibility, primary care services that would qualify for incentive payments, and incentive program recordkeeping, along with payment amount, timing, and distribution method.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 12 of 16\n\n\n provider and beneficiary burden. given longstanding concerns about compliance of aco incentive programs with applicable fraud and abuse laws, premier requests that cms provide template language for use by acos to notify beneficiaries about their new incentive programs. finally, since establishing a primary care incentive payment program is optional for acos, premier recommends that cms make available summary information about the uptake of beneficiary incentive programs when reporting overall mssp results. information from early adopters of incentive programs would be valuable to the remaining acos when making their decisions about applying to establish incentive programs.\n beneficiary notifications\n cms requires that mssp acos notify beneficiaries that their care is being furnished under a shared savings payment model and that they may opt out of having identifiable, claims-level data about themselves shared with their acos. cms has modified the content, frequency and delivery mechanisms for beneficiary notification multiple times since the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inception. currently, notices must be posted in acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 primary care delivery sites and a written beneficiary information notice must be provided upon beneficiary request. cms proposes to expand the requirements beginning july 1, 2019, creating a cms template notice, designed to be a comprehensive single source of mssp information that must be given to beneficiaries during their first primary care visit of each performance year. cms further proposes to add material to the revised notice informing beneficiaries of their option to voluntarily designate an aco professional to coordinate their care (i.e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary clinician\u00e2\u0080\u009d or\u00e2\u0080\u009d main doctor\u00e2\u0080\u009d), thereby implementing the voluntary alignment provisions of bba 2018.\n premier respects cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 intention to provide beneficiaries with sufficient information to make thoughtful and well-informed decisions about their healthcare, and we understand that cms must implement the bba 2018 statutory mandate for informing beneficiaries about voluntary alignment. premier, however, firmly opposes the proposed changes to provide beneficiary notification during the first primary care visit of each performance year. reasons for our opposition include the following: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 a comprehensive written notice at the time of a planned primary care visit is likely to overwhelm beneficiaries with information about myriad topics only distantly related to that visit. the clinical efficacy and experience of care for that visit are likely to be impaired and the information needed only for future use is unlikely either to be retained or to be readily retrieved later when needed. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 prior similar requirements for expanded notifications during primary care visits led to considerable confusion among beneficiaries; for example, some beneficiaries believed that the data-sharing notification was in reality an attempt by the aco to steal their identities. many acos had to reassign staff members from clinical duties to answering beneficiary questions about various notification provisions. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 clinical workflows and electronic record systems would require reconfiguration (e.g., scheduling additional visit time, incorporating reminder prompts and documentation of notification delivery) to assure that the required notifications occurred at the time of the initial primary care visit of each performance year. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 beneficiaries should be able to specify how information is most effectively exchanged with them by cms and by their acos (e.g., hard copy, 1-800-medicare, electronic mail).\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 13 of 16\n\n\n without input from those groups; their input should also guide delivery method choices made available to beneficiaries for various notifications.\n opt-in assignment methodology\n cms discusses at length and invites comments about all aspects of a hybrid assignment methodology that would include direct aco opt in (a beneficiary chooses assignment to a specific aco); voluntary alignment with an aco professional (with resulting assignment to the aco in which that professional participates); and a modification of the current claims-based assignment methodology (incorporating a minimum level of primary care visits furnished to a beneficiary). cms does not make any formal proposal about the hybrid methodology nor indicate a timeline for further consideration of its implementation.\n premier appreciates that cms is exploring the potential for opt-in assignment to increase aco beneficiary engagement that then could lead to more effective care coordination with improved quality and decreased costs. premier does not support implementation of the hybrid opt-in methodology as discussed in the rule at this time. instead, premier recommends that cms do the following: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 maintain the existing claims-based methodology combined with the voluntary alignment option (and minimizing the notification burden related to that option). \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 expeditiously test an option for beneficiary opt-in directly to an aco (in parallel to the existing beneficiary voluntary alignment directly to an aco professional). testing should explore appropriate marketing opportunities for acos analogous to those for ma plans. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 explore additional approaches hybrid assignment and choose one or more for limited-scale testing. before proposing any program-wide replacement mssp assignment methodology, cms should explore rules for rejecting opt-in or voluntary assignment (e.g. when a beneficiary resides outside the geographic region, when a beneficiary does not receive at least one service from a participating provider in the aco).\n\n updating program policies\n voluntary alignment policy revisions\n medicare ffs beneficiaries may choose to designate an aco professional as their primary clinician for coordinating their care, and the beneficiary who does so becomes voluntarily aligned to the designated professional\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aco. currently, a primary clinician must be either a primary care practitioner or practice one of a limited list of specialties (e.g., cardiology), and the beneficiary must have received at least one primary care service from a professional who practices primary care or a listed specialty in the aligned\naco. as part of bba 2018 implementation, cms proposes policy revisions to begin with performance \n year 2019 including removing the specialty restrictions to primary clinician eligibility and no longer requiring the voluntarily aligned beneficiary to have received any services from a professional in the aligned aco during the applicable beneficiary assignment window. premier supports the removal of specialty restrictions for primary clinicians but recommends retention of the requirement for a beneficiary to receive at least one primary care service from an aco participant.\n revised definitions of primary care for use in beneficiary assignment\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 14 of 16\n\n\n system (hcpcs) g-codes (e.g., depression screening) along with new g-codes proposed elsewhere in the rule (e.g., complexity inherent in office visits for certain specialties). cms also proposes to more accurately distinguish short-term, rehabilitation-related evaluation and management services provided in nursing facilities from ongoing primary care services furnished to longer-term nursing facility residents. cms would identify the former services by linking the appropriate cpt codes to nursing facility claims for the same dates of service rather than relying on the place of service code for snfs (code 31) as listed on the professional claim. premier supports the changes as proposed and agrees with cms that linking snf facility claims by date of service to professional claims will better identify short-term, rehabilitation-focused care that should not be counted as primary care services that contribute to beneficiary assignment to acos.\n extreme and uncontrollable circumstances\n in december 2017, cms issued an interim final rule with comment period that established policies to address quality performance scoring and shared loss determinations for mssp acos impacted by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances occurring in performance year 2017 (e.g., hurricanes and widespread wildfires). cms proposes some limited changes to update the existing policies for use in performance year 2018 and subsequent years, including revisions to align the performance scoring and shared loss determination processes with the proposed redesigned aco tracks. premier supports continuation of the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policies as applied in 2017 with the proposed revisions.\n program data and quality measures\n premier agrees with cms that the existing aco quality measure set appropriately emphasizes outcomes over process. premier also supports the goals of the meaningful measures initiative in general as well as the streamlined aco measure set for 2019 as proposed in the medicare physician fee schedule proposed rule. premier recommends that cms seek input from the measures application partnership to enhance the aco measure set by identifying measures that best reflect the focus of alternative payment models such as acos on care coordination and population health and that cms commit funding to development of such measures.\n cms states that the medicare program has become the largest payer for prescription opioids in the united states. as a result, medicare drug event records now constitute a substantial and critically important repository of substance use disorder data. cms currently provides part d prescription drug event data to each aco on a monthly basis, but items potentially related to substance use disorders are routinely de-identified, provided only in aggregate, or both. acos are held accountable for the total health of their beneficiary populations, but the ability of acos to most effectively manage population health is being increasingly constrained by the limited and non-specific substance disorder data with which they are provided. many beneficiaries are taking multiple medications and are at high risk for adverse drug interactions when opioids are prescribed for them. premier believes that it is unfair to hold acos accountable for measures of substance use disorder management until cms provides acos with access to the data necessary for instituting appropriate treatment (i.e., complete and identifiable data for all prescribed medications and their related diagnoses).\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 15 of 16\n\n\n and identifiable data from cms about substance use disorder--related diagnoses and services furnished to their assigned beneficiaries by providers to whom part 2 does not apply.\n cms further states that over one-third of beneficiaries assigned to mssp acos with continuous part d coverage have at least one opioid prescription but that rates vary substantially across acos (10-60%). premier firmly believes that such variability strongly suggests opportunities to improve the quality of care for substance use disorders in many acos. assuming that cms makes sufficient beneficiary medication data available, premier generally supports consideration by cms of adding opioid use measures to the mssp measure set. in particular, however, premier opposes addition of measures that focus primarily on opioid dosing (e.g., nqf #2951 use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer). premier is concerned that rigid adherence to dosing guidelines (e.g., the centers for disease control & prevention guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain) may cause serious adverse outcomes (e.g., depression, suicide) for patients being successfully managed on long-term opioid analgesics whose dosing regimens are abruptly changed to achieve guideline compliance.\n promoting interoperability (pi)\n cms seeks to harmonize mssp quality and health it activities with the quality payment program (qpp) through two actions that would become effective january 1, 2019: 1) retiring the aco-11 measure (use of certified electronic health record technology (cehrt)); and 2) requiring instead certification by each aco that the level of cehrt usage by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clinicians meets or exceeds the advanced apm cehrt threshold under the qpp. the latter requirement would become a condition of participation for all mssp tracks, and all payment models within those tracks, that also meet the financial risk standard required of advanced apms. premier supports both of these proposed actions regarding aco cehrt usage and appreciates the associated burden reduction for acos and their clinicians. however, the first change as proposed could potentially create disparate scoring standards for the promoting interoperability category in mips for aco clinicians that are not an advanced apm or do not meet the thresholds to be considered a qualifying participant. while the aco requirement is that clinicians would only have to certify cehrt usage, the mips requirement would require clinicians to actually submit pi data for scoring using mips-apm scoring standard. premier requests that cms avoid creating confusion by confirming that clinicians in acos that are mips apms would not be subject to full pi category reporting and scoring but instead could simply certify their cehrt usage. the pi category weight for such clinicians would then be redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories.\n pharmacy care coordination: request for comments\n premier supports exploration by cms of approaches that could facilitate collaboration between acos and part d stand-alone prescription drug plan sponsors and lead to improved outcomes, such as more widespread use of medication therapy management. cms should investigate ways to make complete pharmacy data more readily available to mssp acos and their clinicians. particular attention should be given to enabling technology methods (e.g., secure data access portals, data sets accessible using application programming interfaces) that could provide acos with real-time access to claims data (prior to or synchronous with claims processing) for their aligned beneficiaries. real-time access would allow acos to build provider alert processes that would improve care by triggering rapid clinical interventions when needed, as is being done already by some ma and commercial plans.\n\n\n", "0450": "the comments of the catholic health association of the united states are attached.\n 1875 eye street nw, ste. 1000   washington, dc 20006   phone 202.296.3993

to success\n\n dear ms. verma:\n the catholic health association of the united states (cha) is pleased to submit these comments on the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) proposed rule on the medicare shared savings program and accountable care organizations (acos) published in the federal register on august 17, 2018 at 83 fed.reg 41786.  we appreciate your staff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ongoing efforts to increase the coordination of beneficiary care, improve quality and manage healthcare costs in the medicare program.  cha offers the following comments on the proposed rule.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 redesigned mssp participation options\n cha appreciates and shares cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal of encouraging more mssp acos to transition to two- sided risk models.  however, we are deeply concerned that the proposed redesigned structure is too aggressive and will deny participants the time and tools they need to realize the potential quality, clinical and business benefits from acos.  the effect of many of the proposals will be to make providers reluctant to enter or remain in the program.\n glide path to performance based risk\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 2 of 5\n would offer the both the highest potential for shared savings and the highest potential liability for shared loss.\n the proposal would allow at most two years in a one-sided model. we strongly recommend that this period be extended and that acos have the opportunity of participating for at least three years before they begin to assume down-side loss.  studies have shown that acos are more likely to achieve shared savings with time, with the shared savings rate doubling over three years of experience.1  sufficient time in an upside-only model prior to moving to downside risk will promote aco success.  should participants find themselves ready to assume risk sooner, we agree they should have the option to choose to advance more rapidly through the basic levels.\n we also urge cms to increase the shared savings rates in the basic track. cms should maintain the current track 1 savings rate of 50% for basic levels a and b.  we agree that, as proposed, the shared savings rate should increase as acos begin to assume and increase downside risk, with the opportunity for savings increasing from 50% rising by 5 to 10 percentage points with each step. shared shavings help participants to recoup the up-front investments that are crucial to the success of acos.\n cha urges cms to incorporate a transition from basic level e to the enhanced track. under the current proposal, the only option available for many acos would be the enhanced track. cms should either build a glide path to the highest risk level within the enhanced track or offer an additional track to help bridge the gap between the basic and enhanced tracks. we also urge cms to increase the incentive for acos to enter the enchanced track to 80% (same as the next generation aco program).\n annual participation elections\n as already noted, cha supports the proposal to allow acos to skip levels within the basic track. cms indicates that an aco can only spend one year at a given level, even if it has skipped ahead to that level, progressing to level e and remaining there for the duration of the agreement period. we suggest cms allow acos that advance themselves to remain in that track instead of automatically advancing, in other words, not to require them to move beyond the level they would have been in had they not chosen to advance.\n cha also supports allowing acos to choose either prospective beneficiary assignment or prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation, as required by the bipartisan budget act (bba) of 2018, and to give acos an annual opportunity to change their beneficiary assignment choice. many acos will choose prospective assignment to help them manage care as they assume greater levels of risk. other acos may prefer the retrospective\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 3 of 5\n assignment model so they can add beneficiaries throughout the year. we support giving acos this choice, a clinical and business decision each aco can make according to its situation.\n determining participation options based on medicare ffs revenue\n an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to participate in a given basic track level will be determined in part by its designation as a high revenue or low revenue aco, high revenue being a proxy for acos that typically include a hospital  and low-revenue a proxy for  physician group acos. cms states its belief that high revenue acos are more capable of accepting higher risk than low revenue acos. high revenue acos would have fewer participation options, in that those with \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d would only be eligible for the enhanced track whether they are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cre-entering\u00e2\u0080\u009d the program. in addition, low revenue (and inexperienced) acos may operate under the basic track for a maximum of two agreement periods, whereas high revenue acos are limited to one agreement period.\n cha opposes the proposed distinction between high and low revenue acos. we urge cms to eliminate it and to treat all acos the same.  we are concerned that the proposed distinction would discourage acos that have the potential to generate substantial savings to the program from participating.  we also believe cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rationale for the distinction is flawed.  an analysis described by premier in its comment letter of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009chospital-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d (the aco includes a hospital tin participant) found it to be inaccurate, with at least 20 percent of health system-led acos being designated as \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician-led.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  cms also relied on its assertion that low revenue acos produce greater savings than high revenue acos.  however, premier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s analysis found that some of the highest performing individual acos are in fact hospital-led.\n cha believes the creation of disincentives for hospital-led acos is inappropriate because the purpose of acos is to create incentives for providers to work together across care settings in the best interest of the beneficiaries through collaboration, innovation and coordination.  including a hospital in an aco facilitates the provision of specialty care as well as primary care and enhances the ability to make sure that patients receive care in the most appropriate setting.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 fee-for-service beneficiary enhancements\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 4 of 5\n also supports efforts to protect from liability beneficiaries who have not been prospectively assigned but are inadvertently provided with telehealth services under a waiver they cannot participate in.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n beneficiary incentives\n cms current authorizes acos to provide in-kind items or services as incentives to beneficiaries. the bba of 2018 provides that risk-bearing acos may establish benefit incentive programs. consistent with the bba, cms has proposed that eligible acos be allowed to provide incentive payments directly to beneficiaries when they receive qualifying primary care services from designated types of primary care providers, in the amount of $20 and in non-cash form such as gift cards or checks.  cha supports this proposal to provide beneficiary incentives, and suggests that cms provide template language for providers to use when telling beneficiaries about the program, to avoid any issues with fraud and abuse laws.\n beneficiary notification\n current regulations on beneficiary notification require aco participants to post signage with relevant information in participating sites and, in some instances, make written notification available to beneficiaries upon request. cms proposes to expand the content to inform beneficiaries of their option to voluntarily designate an aco professional to coordinate their care (i.e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary clinician\u00e2\u0080\u009d or\u00e2\u0080\u009d main doctor\u00e2\u0080\u009d) to implement the voluntary alignment provisions of bba 2018.  cms also proposes to require that aco participants provide this information to each medicare ffs beneficiary at the first primary care visit of each performance year. while cha agrees beneficiaries should be provided with notice of their options, cha does not support this proposal.  we are concerned that the proposal as structured will be administratively burdensome for providers and confusing for beneficiaries. instead we recommend that cms maintain the current notice requirements and provide information about voluntary designation through another means after outreach to beneficiary user groups on what would be most effective.\n quality measures\n cms has invited input on possible changes to the quality measure set and modifications to program data shared with acos to support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative and to respond to the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opioid misuse epidemic.\n\nms. seema verma \n october 16, 2018 page 5 of 5\n working to identify the next generation of core measures. cms should seek to identify measures that best reflect the focus of acos and other alternative payment models on care coordination and population health and should commit to funding development of such measures.\n cha shares cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concern about the public health crisis surrounding the opioid overdose epidemic and the desire to avoid over-prescription of opioids. at the same time, effective pain management is an essential element of patient well-being and a key element in the provision of palliative care services to patients and families facing serious illness.  the catholic health ministry is strongly committed to providing patients with excellent palliative care services, which focus on providing relief from the symptoms, pain and stress of a serious illness.  as you consider the addition of opioid-related aco measures, we urge you to take care to avoid creating incentives that could unintentionally deny access to opioids for those who truly need them for pain relief.\n last, while statutory changes are necessary, we reiterate the importance of aligning 42 cfr part 2 (part 2) confidentiality requirements for sharing a patient's substance use disorder records with the requirements in the health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa). unlike hipaa, part 2 does not allow for sharing or re-disclosure of identifiable substance use disorder information for treatment, payment or health care operations (\"tpo\") purposes without patient consent. moreover, part 2 requires regulated programs to provide a notice to recipients of identifiable substance use disorder information noting that the information cannot be re-disclosed. from a compliance perspective, the different standards between hipaa and part 2 have made it extremely difficult for our hospitals and health systems to know when and how this information may be shared, including within individual hospitals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 despite the importance of care coordination for individuals with substance use disorders. while supporting part 2 reform, we also urge cms to make available to providers engaged in population health management such as acos, and bound by a data use agreement with cms, complete and identifiable data from cms about substance use disorder-related diagnoses and services furnished to their assigned beneficiaries by providers to whom part 2 does not apply.\n in closing, thank you for the opportunity to share these comments on the proposed medicare shared savings program and accountable care organizations rule. we look forward to working with you on these and other issues that continue to challenge and strengthen the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hospitals and health care system. if you have any questions about these comments or need more information, please do not hesitate to contact me or kathy curran, senior director public policy, at 202-721-6300.\n sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n", "0451": "as you know, under the current medicare shared savings program (mssp) beneficiary assignment regulations, an np is an authorized aco professional, but their patients cannot be assigned to the aco unless they receive one primary care service from a primary care physician participating with the aco each year. this has inhibited np practices from joining or establishing shared savings aco's and limited the scope of the shared savings program (mssp). if the mssp is to continue to develop and improve patient access, quality and cost effectiveness, it must be fully inclusive of nps and their patients.\r\n\r\ntherefore, i support cms' proposal to update the voluntary alignment option for beneficiary assignment in the shared savings program (mssp). this proposal would allow a patient to choose an np as their primary shared savings aco clinician and be assigned to an mssp aco without requiring a primary care service from a primary care physician. this proposal will increase the participation of nps and their patients in the mssp and is consistent with a patient-centered approach

well as the conditions they are used to treat, care coordination and transitions, and preventive health measures. apha appreciates the opportunity to provide input to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed redesign of the shared savings program and offers the following recommendations based on our members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 feedback, including those working in acos, in response to the proposed rule.\n\ni. redesigning participation options to facilitate transition to performance-\n based risk (pgs. 41789-41806)\n\n 2\n would have the option to participate under a basic track (offers a path from one-sided models to progressively higher risk-reward potential), or the enhanced track (highest level of risk- reward potential). while apha acknowledges the advantages that can result from increasing acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risks, such as facilitating value-based purchasing, we are aware of challenges acos have faced when deciding to accelerate risks. we offer the following points to consider as cms moves forward.\n while a number of apha members already participate in the advanced next generation aco models, many of these models are in closed health care systems with established infrastructure(s) and greater control over the health care services provided to their attributed beneficiaries. although apha appreciates and supports variable models and types of networks, certain options impact acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to assume risk, particularly for those shared saving program acos with multiple contracted providers. because there is still a significant amount of provider and beneficiary education needed, apha recommends cms pilot the proposed models in different types of systems (e.g., open and closed health care systems), utilizing team-based care (e.g., pharmacists, etc.), to better understand implications, including practitioner responses, to aco participation and subsequent shifts in risk.\n apha appreciates the increased flexibility cms is granting acos to take on two-sided risk. however, a number of our members stated that their acos are also considering becoming medicare advantage (ma) plans due to the increased flexibility recently granted to ma plans to request advanced apm status for certain provider contracts.1 accordingly, for planning purposes, apha asks cms for clarification if it is the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desire to shift its aco models to ma models.\n\nii. program data and quality measures related to opioids (pages 41906-41908)  \n\n\na. program data (pgs. 41907-41908) \n\n apha appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for feedback regarding aggregated medicare part d data that could be useful to acos to combat opioid misuse in their assigned beneficiary population. generally, apha encourages data-sharing across the health care system, as there are many different uses for aggregated data by different entities, including acos. apha foresees an opportunity to utilize part d claim and claim line feed (cclf) files to better understand health care expenditures, including the implications of part d services on other components of medicare and vice-versa. such information may also be helpful to acos in considering policies to manage their beneficiary population.\n apha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s members involved in acos indicated real-time data is useful in helping combat opioid misuse in their assigned beneficiary population. acos typically rely on real-time data when developing interventions and targeting those interventions. for example, we are aware of acos using prescribing data (e.g., examining prescribing frequency and morphine milligram equivalent amounts) to help identify prescribers for additional pain management education.\n 1 cms. other payer advanced apm determination process: medicare health plans fact sheet. november 2017. available at: https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-payment-program/resource-library/2018-medicare-health-plans-apms.pdf\n\n 3\n however, because the part d data cms shares and proposes to share can be outdated, its usefulness has limitations. accordingly, apha requests cms facilitate acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 access to data, such as prescription data, in real-time. furthermore, apha recommends cms examine the formatting of data to effectuate its use and understandability.\n\nb. federal information to share with acos (pg. 41907) \n\n in the proposed rule, cms indicates it will continue to share information highlighting federal opioid initiatives, including the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccenters for disease control and prevention (cdc) guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe surgeon general's report on alcohol, drugs, and health\u00e2\u0080\u009d, with acos. to better address different facets of the opioid epidemic and patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pain management needs, apha encourages cms to include different types of clinical guidelines and information regarding: pain management, including acute and chronic pain management; naloxone (e.g., \u00e2\u0080\u009csurgeon general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advisory on naloxone and opioid overdose\u00e2\u0080\u009d2); treatment of substance use disorder; and stigma (e.g., samhsa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cwords matter: how language choice can reduce stigma\u00e2\u0080\u009d3). in addition, apha recommends cms share information with acos regarding inclusion of pharmacists on care teams, such as cdc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvancing team-based care through collaborative practice agreements\u00e2\u0080\u009d4. apha believes this information, although not opioid-specific, will help acos effectively utilize pharmacists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 medication expertise when addressing patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unique medication needs and those of its population more broadly.\n\nc. quality measures (pgs. 41907-41908) \n\n in the proposed rule, cms seeks comments on measures to add to the quality measure set to address the opioid epidemic and addiction. apha members support adding the nqf- endorsed measures5 highlighted in the proposed rule to the aco quality measure set. apha requests cms also consider opioid-related measures for persons with polypharmacy6 and persons with geriatric syndrome. should such measures not yet be developed, apha encourages cms to work with the pharmacy quality alliance (pqa).\n while apha recognizes cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intent to enhance the quality measure set to better address the opioid epidemic and addiction, our members indicate the use of real-time data could be more effective and timelier in addressing the opioid epidemic and managing population health. accordingly, apha encourages cms to perform additional outreach to acos to identify\n\n2 u.s. surgeon general. surgeon general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advisory on naloxone and opioid overdose. april 5, 2018, available at: \n\n 4\n strategies that use real-time data to address the opioid epidemic and for cms to consider how it can encourage broader use of such strategies.\n\niii. promoting interoperability (pgs. 41908-41911) \n\n apha appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued promotion and encouragement of certified electronic health record technology (cehrt). in the proposed rule, cms states \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6all acos in a track or a payment model within a track that does not meet the financial risk standard to be an advanced apm must certify that at least 50 percent of their eligible clinicians use cehrt to document and communicate clinical care to their patients or other health care providers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d however, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal would not adequately incentivize interoperability with and among necessary members of the health care team who are not considered eligible clinicians, including pharmacists, because only eligible clinicians use of cehrt is counted towards the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certification of at least 50 percent. therefore, apha recommends cms include pharmacists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cehrt use in calculating acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cehrt certification goals.\n\niv. coordination of pharmacy care for aco beneficiaries (pgs. 41911-41912) \n\n apha is very pleased cms acknowledges in the proposed rule the positive impact pharmacists and their services have on beneficiaries and their care. in the proposed rule, cms requests feedback on ways acos, in particular shared savings program acos, and part d sponsors can improve the coordination of pharmacy care to achieve \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6better health outcomes, better health care, and lower per-capita expenditures for medicare beneficiaries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d we agree \u00e2\u0080\u009c[i]ncreased collaboration between acos and part d sponsors may facilitate better and more affordable drug treatment options for beneficiaries by encouraging the use of generic prescription medications, where clinically appropriate, or reducing medical errors through better coordination between providers [including pharmacists] and part d sponsors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d pharmacists already support both acos and part d plans in efforts to improve medication and health outcomes. apha believes better integrating the pharmacy and medical benefit and data will provide a more comprehensive picture of overall quality, outcomes and costs. current coverage and payment policies related to medications place incentives on the short-term, focusing on cost containment for the product rather than weighing the overall clinical benefit to the patient and the impact to their medical costs. we concur with cms that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpart d sponsors may be able to play a greater role in coordinating the care of their enrolled medicare ffs beneficiaries and having greater accountability for their overall health outcomes, such as for beneficiaries with chronic diseases where treatment and outcome are highly dependent on appropriate medication use and adherence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d therefore, pharmacists look forward to an enhanced role in, but not limited to, the areas mentioned in the proposed rule \u00e2\u0080\u0094 increasing clinician formulary compliance (when clinically appropriate) and medication compliance; providing pharmacy counseling services from pharmacists; and implementing medication therapy management (mtm).\n apha also wants to ensure cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to enhance pharmacy care coordination is broader than focusing solely on expanding the use of pharmacy benefit managers7 (pbms) and\n 7 as hhs is aware, there are pbm practices in the medicare part d program negatively impacting patient costs, care and access, such as direct or indirect remuneration (dir) fees and narrow distribution networks. these practices impact the sustainability of community pharmacies and\n\n 5\n raw data analysis without utilizing frontline pharmacists to leverage the provider-beneficiary relationship to truly coordinate care. apha has concerns cms may not appreciate the difference between part d mtm and medication management provided through coordinated care models as well as the variability of the mtm benefit within part d. medication management services delivered in acos and pcmhs focus on comprehensive longitudinal management and monitoring of medications by pharmacists working in coordination with the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care team based on individualized patient needs. follow-up visits are scheduled related to achieving clinical goals with input from other providers. with part d mtm, there is significant plan variability in beneficiary eligibility for mtm services where part d plan sponsors use plan-level data to determine the number of part d medications, number and types of chronic conditions, and assigned cost thresholds for eligibility.8 thus, a beneficiary may qualify for mtm under one part d plan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criteria and not under another plan, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear to providers which of their beneficiaries are eligible for mtm under a given plan. additionally, eligible beneficiaries qualify for an annual comprehensive medication review, however, follow-up services to address problems and optimize medications varies greatly in delivery format and frequency. accordingly, apha strongly recommends any efforts by cms to improve \u00e2\u0080\u009cpharmacy care coordination\u00e2\u0080\u009d through mtm services address the current barriers to beneficiary access and pharmacist/ pharmacy participation.\n\nv. incorporating pharmacists into acos \n\n pharmacists can play a direct role in helping acos meet their two primary objectives: achieving quality measures and saving money. many of those benchmarks require careful attention and monitoring of medications as well as the conditions they are used to treat. example metrics where pharmacists will likely play a key role include medication reconciliation after discharge from an inpatient facility (aco-12) and preventive health measures, including influenza immunization (aco-14); pneumococcal vaccination (aco-15); preventive care and screening: tobacco use: screening and cessation intervention (aco-17); statin therapy for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular (cv) disease (aco-42);diabetes mellitus: hemoglobin a1c poor control (aco-27); and falls: screening, risk-assessment, and plan of care to prevent future falls (aco-47).  however, pharmacists are not recognized under medicare as \u00e2\u0080\u009celigible clinicians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which impedes their incorporation into health care teams and the effective and efficient delivery of quality care. one immediate solution would be for cms to use its authority under section 1848(q)(1)(c)(i)(ii) [of the social security act] to expand the definition of eligible clinician to include \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6such other eligible professionals (as defined in subsection (k)(3)(b)) as specified by the secretary\u00e2\u0080\u00a69\u00e2\u0080\u009d to pharmacists.\n numerous studies have shown pharmacist-provided patient care services can have a significant impact on lowering costs and improving outcomes for patients with costly chronic\n consequently, patient choice and access to care. accordingly, prior to any discussion of expanding the purview of pbms within the medicare program, our organizations recommend cms first eliminate problematic pbm practices in the medicare part d program to maintain patient access to medications. 8 cms. 2017 medicare part d medication therapy management (mtm) programs. fact sheet. august 17, 2017. available at:

expanding patient access to pharmacist-provided patient care services can help reduce the possible $672 billion spent by the u.s. annually on medication-related problems and nonoptimized medication therapy.11 as cms may know, eighty-nine percent of americans live within five miles of a community pharmacy.12 better utilizing pharmacists in all practice settings to provide care could have a profound, and immediate impact on access, quality, health outcomes and costs for a large portion of the population, particularly in medically underserved communities.\n currently, pharmacists, including those in acos, deliver some medicare services under compliant arrangements with physicians and other providers. however, these services are not attributed to or able to be billed directly by pharmacists, thereby leading to challenges in finding sustainable business models  and reaping the benefits from pharmacist-provided patient care services. consequently, pharmacists often operate as \u00e2\u0080\u009cinvisible providers\u00e2\u0080\u009d on patient-care teams, resulting in cms and other payers being unaware of the vital role pharmacists play in improving patient outcomes. therefore, apha strongly recommends cms take advantage of any regulatory discretion it has to remove barriers recognizing pharmacists as eligible clinicians in acos.\n once again, thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed rule and consideration of our comments. as pharmacists continue to work in collaboration with our physician colleagues as vital members of patient care teams, we are happy to facilitate discussions between cms and our members who currently provide pharmacist-provided patient care services under acos and other advanced apms in various practice settings. if you have any questions or require additional information, please contact michael baxter, director of regulatory affairs, at mbaxter@aphanet.org or by phone at (202) 429-7538.\n

register, vol. 83, no. 160, august 17, 2018.\n\n submitted electronically via www.regulations.gov\n dear ms. verma,\n unitypoint accountable care (uac) appreciates this opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed rule. unitypoint accountable care is the aco affiliated with unitypoint health (uph), one of the nation\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s most integrated healthcare systems. through more than 30,000 employees and relationships with more than 290 physician clinics, 38 hospitals in metropolitan and rural communities and 15 home health agencies throughout our 9 regions, uph provides care throughout lowa, central illinois and southern wisconsin. on an annual basis, uph hospitals, clinics and home health provide a full range of coordinated care to patients and families through more than 6.2 million patient visits. in addition, uph is committed to payment reform and is actively engaged in numerous initiatives which support population health and value-based care. unitypoint accountable care (uac) has value-based contracts with multiple payers, including medicare. uac is a current next generation aco, and we include providers that have participated in the medicare shared savings program (mssp) as well as providers from the pioneer aco model.\n\n uac appreciates the time and effort of cms in developing and proposing this rule and respectfully offers the following comments.\n\n general comments\n as an early adopter of aco models, uac has and is participating in medicare aco models as a glide path to assuming greater risk while enhancing overall population health. uac is one of the largest aco participating in the next generation aco model with roughly 80,000 beneficiaries attributed to this\n cms-1701-p unitypoint accountable care\n program and has received first-year shared savings with performance results pending for the second year.\n historically, uac has providers that have participated in the mssp as well as providers from the trinity pioneer aco, which was the most rural aco and achieved two years of shared savings. in our opinion, medicare aco models have succeeded in offering a differentiated patient experience through enhanced provider engagement and testing benefit enhancements and programmatic waivers. we also agree that a transition to value-based care necessitates participation by all providers in two-sided risk arrangements and applaud efforts by cms to examine geographies, provider types and settings as well as beneficiary engagement to encourage further aco model penetration. while we support the pathway to success proposal as an initial step to streamline aco thought and resources, we believe that more work is needed to make aco model costs sustainable and predictable, to foster regulatory flexibility that encourages further care delivery innovation, and to promote aco service delivery in rural areas and across provider settings. we would also like to see differentiation between basic track level e and the enhanced track beyond heightened risk. these differences should include expanded regulatory relief, beneficiary enhancements and waivers, and beneficiary engagement tools. we would also encourage cms to more closely link aco performance and regulatory standards to those applicable to medicare advantage (ma).\n\n redesigning participation options to transition to performance-based risk cmss is proposing to restructure the mssp to include a basic and enhanced track and create a glide path to risk. among the proposed changes are lengthened agreement periods, annual participation elections, participation options based on medicare revenue and aco experience, and participation requirements targeting two-sided models.\n e comment: we generally support the renaming and streamlining of medicare\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s framework for acos.\n in particular, we support:\n o longer 5-year agreement periods. we agree that this will add stability for potential participants\n\n\n making investments in this program.\n o initial 18-month timeframe for start-up activities and performance. this allows any new aco\n\n\n participant, regardless of track and level, the ability to acclimate to the new program, including its administrative requirements and the receipt of more performance/claims data. although cms has proposed to implement this 18-month timeframe for 2019 only, we would support this initial performance period for future years as well.\n\n o prospective attribution throughout the pathways to success framework. when we participated in the mssp, our retrospective attribution churn rate was approximately 25% per quarter and undermined efforts at targeted care coordination and quality improvement initiatives. to avoid this churn, we believe that it is imperative for acos to have a durable perception of their target population.\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u008c\u0090 transition to risk. we back the transition from upside-only risk to two-sided risk within the initial agreement period and agree that cms should look at aco experience to determine participation eligibility. we believe that all acos should be able to assume downside risk within performance periods four or five and that, while experienced acos should not be able to revert to one-sided models, cms should consider some flexibility for experienced acos with small attributed\n page 2\n cms-1701-p unitypoint accountable care\n populations (less than 5,000) to permit their initial participation to include basic track, levels c or d at the option of the aco.\n\n o advanced alternative payment model (advanced apm) status. we agree that advanced apm status should be limited to basic track, level eand enhanced track participants. we believe this status is an incentive in itself for transitioning to heightened models of payment risk.\n\n\n\n given our experience with medicare aco models and the factors that influenced our participation, we believe that the pathway to success proposal could be strengthened to better encourage providers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 transition to value. although we believe that acos must transition to risk, there is a learning curve associated with successful population health strategies and implementation. key areas for your reconsideration are:\n\n o minimum savings rate (msr). using cms performance data, the national association of acos found that in 2017 60% of mssp acos generated savings for medicare and 34% of mssp acos earned shared savings.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 the gap in these figures (i.e. 26%) is attributable to acos whose savings did not meet the msr threshold. for acos in basic track level a and level b, msr is set according to the number of assigned beneficiaries with a floor of 2.0 for 60,000+ beneficiaries. in subsequent years, lower msr/mlr (minimum savings rate / minimum loss rate) corridors may be established by the aco. although we understand economies of scale, we are concerned that small acos are immediately disincentivized to participate.\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u008c\u0090 shared savings rate. rates are proposed at 25% for basic track, levels a and b; 30% for basic track, level c; 40% for basic track, level d; 50% for basic track, level e; and 75% for enhanced track. this is a drastic departure from current law, in which mssp track 1 participants are eligible to receive a 50% savings rate. we question the appetite of new providers to participate when potential rewards are limited to 25% as well as of some experienced acos to continue at lower rates. we support the national association of acos recommendation that rates be revised to 50% for basic track, levels a and b; 55% for basic track, levels c and d; and 60% for basic track, level e.\n\n o early termination for acos with \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3poor financial\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 performance. this is defined as aco expenditures\n\n\n for the assigned beneficiary population that exceed the aco updated benchmark by an amount equal to or exceeding either the acos negative msr under a one-sided model or the acos mlr under a two-sided model after two performance years. we believe that this provision overemphasizes cost savings without taking into account other performance indicators, that risk corridors disadvantage rural providers, and that two years is not sufficient duration. we request that cms revisit the early termination provision and its intended use.\n\n lastly, while we support participation distinctions based on aco experience, we are opposed to the eligibility distinction based on medicare ffs revenue (i.e. low-revenue acos versus high-revenue acos). cms rationalizes this distinction by stating:\n\n . our policies would recognize the relationship between the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s degree of control over total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for its assigned\n\n\n 1 naacos, more medicare accountable care organizations (acos) achieve quality and cost goals in 2017:\n medicare shared savings program (mssp) acos improve quality and save

medicare-acos-achieve-quality-and-cost-goals-in-2017\n page 3\n cms-1701-p unitypoint accountable care\n beneficiaries and its readiness to accept higher or lower degrees of performance- based risk... . by basing participation options on the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s degree of control over total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s assigned beneficiaries, low revenue acos, which tend to be smaller and have less capital, would be able to continue in the program longer under lower levels of risk; whereas high revenue acos, which tend to include institutional providers and are typically larger and better capitalized, would be required to move more quickly to higher levels of performance- based risk in the enhanced track, because they should be able to exert more influence, direction, and coordination over the full continuum of care.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5\n the inclusion of a \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3low-revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 model is cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s recognition that aco models and other value-based arrangements have low adoption rates in rural areas and small physician practices. we were surprised that cms did not take a more targeted approach \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 offering incentives for rural providers within the proposed framework, including lower levels of msr, higher rates for shared savings, or differentiated rules that invoke involuntary termination. that said, we do appreciate this affirmative attempt by cms to include rural providers and beneficiaries rather than using a mips-like approach, which has been to exclude/excuse rural providers from participation. however, we do not believe that rural and small providers fit squarely within the low-revenue category. in fact, we believe this revenue-based distinction establishes a dichotomy that will lead to unintended and even contrary results for rural providers, small providers, and many acos with mixed ffs and cost-based revenue (including both urban and rural provider/suppliers).\n\n to illustrate our point, we suggest that cms examine healthcare delivery in some midwest / plains states (such as lowa, kansas, nebraska, south dakota, north dakota). the penetration of medicare acos and ma plans in these states is low to moderate and the population base is relatively small. to accelerate the adoption of value-based care in rural america, cms must encourage regional care delivery (regardless of provider status as low- or high-revenue), structure reimbursement to recognize cost of care versus access to care (instead of cost-based reimbursement), and streamline regulations to enable providers and beneficiaries to compare aco services and ma plans.\n\n o regional care delivery. contrary to the definition of \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3low revenue\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5, rural healthcare delivery cannot exist in isolation. the low- and high-revenue distinction does not portray ideal care in rural areas and its reliance on urban specialists and hospitals. in reality, most \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3rural\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 acos would be more accurately characterized as mixed-revenue \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 for example, midwest providers do not practice in isolation, they have relationships with urban hospitals and specialists, and they are challenged with an eroding commercial payer base and tight operating margins. many urban hospitals have relationships with rural providers and vice versa. hospital-based acos are not homogenous and we believe that the acos composition should be considered when determine its eligibility glidepath. we would also refute generalizations that acos encourage consolidation and reduce competition and choice for medicare ffs beneficiaries. this assertion fails to distinguish between provider ownership and collaborative arrangements and does not account for provider motivation. in uac, approximately half of our providers are independent and choose to enter into an aco contract to obtain support services that they cannot afford and to offer a\n\n\n ? medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6pathways to success, cms-1701-p, 83(160) fed reg 41786, at page 41788\n page 4\n oo\n cms-1701-p unitypoint accountable care\n collaborative platform to reduce fees for their beneficiaries. other drivers of participation in the aco include avoidance of mips reporting, the advanced apm bonus and economies of scale (i.e.\n caseload size for risk bearing). we do not believe that a low-revenue distinction will result in an influx of participation by small and/or rural acos.\n\n restructuring rural reimbursement to differentiate access from care. cost-based reimbursement is the elephant in the room and is at odds with principles of value-based care. first, cost-based reimbursement has inverse incentives; namely, reduced utilization actually increases cost. for example, if we reduced the average daily census in a critical access hospital (cah) by half from 10 to 5, the cost will be readjusted against those five patients through the cost report and interim rate setting process. basically what cost $100 in year one is now $200 in year two\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s rate, because fixed cost and core staffing expense remain static and there\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s virtually no opportunity to lower variable expense. over time, cahs always receive their costs. the same holds true for physicians in rural health clinics (rhcs). they receive an all inclusive rate payment, which is capped in a rhc and unable to be flexed. second, cah cost reports include hospital services like depreciation and administrative costs, but do not include investments in community-based services. the aco must incur these investments as \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3costs\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 against its benchmark. third, aco performance periods do not sync with cah operations, which have a fiscal rate adjustment in july.\n\n despite the proposed cap adjustments, we believe that more must be done. by separating the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3cost of access\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 from the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3cost of care,\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 reimbursement incentives and high-value care could and should be aligned in rural areas. the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3cost of care\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 concept is the equivalent of traditional medical care and could be reimbursed through medicare fee for service rate schedules. like all healthcare facilities, we believe that small/rural hospitals should be held accountable for reducing the cost of care while maintaining quality standards. a value-based payment program could be implemented for cost of care services with the potential to be rewarded through a shared savings or other quality program. \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3cost of access\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 refers to services that maintain/improve access for beneficiaries in rural areas that are proven to lower the total cost of care. these items should be encouraged. examples of access costs include care coordination teams, palliative care, telehealth, homecare, hospice, evisits, and urgent care clinics. these cost items could be reimbursed using an incremental rate founded on cost-based reimbursement and proposed adjustments could be made via cost reports or similar mechanisms. as envisioned, an add-on earned for rural access could be applied to any value-based program. it would allow rural providers and facilities to participate in value-based programs for their \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3cost of care\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 component, while still receiving proportional cost-based reimbursement to promote \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3cost of access\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 infrastructure.\n\n streamline aco and ma regulations to promote comparisons. despite efforts by this rule to condense and more narrowly define aco tracks, the future of acos remains unclear. we believe there has been a missed opportunity to more clearly defined acos as a service delivery alternative and compare its advantages and disadvantages to traditional ffs and ma alternatives. in this rule as well as future rulemaking, we urge cms to include discussion of how aco and ma regulations can be similarly constructed and to be intentional about regulatory differences. this would not only streamline provider compliance but also enhance public perception and beneficiary understanding. for example, we would suggest that the meaningful measures initiative provide\n page 5\n cms-1701-p unitypoint accountable care\n guidance on how quality measures and reporting could be more similar, including the use of common definitions and the potential for star ratings.\n\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements\n cms is proposing to offer telehealth and 3-day snf waivers to two-sided acos, regardless of the\n beneficiary attribution methodology. the telehealth waiver not only eliminates the geographic restriction\n for originating site but allows the originating site to include a beneficiary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s home.\n\n e comment: uac has been on the frontlines of developing both benefit enhancements proposed by this rule. our utilization of these waivers has historically exceeded their use by other medicare aco participants. we firmly believe that benefit enhancements are a powerful tool to enhance patient care and provider engagement and we fully support their use by risk-bearing acos. we agree with cms that acos that bear financial risk have a heightened incentive to restrain wasteful spending and mitigates the likelihood of over-utilization of healthcare services. benefit enhancements remove barriers to care and allow providers to determine the best means of delivering care and providing access to care for their patients. these tools are foundational for value-based care and we would suggest that as acos accept more risk, they should be afforded greater access to benefit enhancements. in future rulemaking, we would encourage cms to consider additional benefit enhancements that would be available under the enhanced track.\n\n in terms the proposed 3-day waiver, we would raise issue with the cms assumption related to how rural areas may \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3control unnecessary costs.\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 as a reminder, uac is located in lowa and central illinois, in largely rural geographies. while we concur that there are fewer snfs located in rural areas, the current ffs payment differential between snfs and cah swing-bed services may assist with access to care but will not necessarily reduce costs. cah swing-bed services are reimbursed at 101 percent of \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3reasonable cost\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5, while snf services are currently paid at predetermined daily rates under the snf prospective payment system. the oig found that cah reimbursement equated to almost four times the snf reimbursement.? we urge cms to revisit how to incorporate and encourage cost-based services and facilities to transition to value.\n\n providing tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n cms is proposing that two-sided acos, regardless of the beneficiary attribution methodology, establish a\n beneficiary incentive program. the incentive payment would be paid to each assigned beneficiary for each\n qualifying service received. in addition, cms is proposing to reinstate a beneficiary notification\n requirement and enable an opt-in based assignment methodology. this point of care notification would\n include information on voluntary alignment, aco providers/suppliers participation in the shared savings\n program and opting out of data sharing.\n\n e comment: we support removing restrictions on two-sided acos that limit tools to promote beneficiary engagement and instituting practices to empower patients and caregivers with\n\n\n 3 oig, \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3medicare could have saved billions at critical access hospitals if swing-bed services were reimbursed using the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system rates\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5, march 2015, accessed at httos://oig.hhs loas/ rts/region5/51200046.pdf\n page 6\n cms-1701-p unitypoint accountable care\n information and incentives to inform high-value care decisions. this includes the ability to offer beneficiary incentive programs. along with this support, we urge cms to carefully monitor these programs to identify future opportunities to improve beneficiary engagement rates and enhance meaningful outcomes. although this is a good start, we believe that the proposal should allow more targeted and tiered benefits to specific aco populations or subpopulations. we would also call out that acos are proposed to fully fund the costs associated with operating a beneficiary incentive program, including the cost of any incentive payments. this funding assumes a stable and predictable payment mechanism, which has not been demonstrated under mssp financial models, and may result in the availability of this incentive to fewer beneficiaries than anticipated.\n\n cms is proposing that acos must notify beneficiaries at the point of care about voluntary alignment, its participating in the mssp and the opportunity to decline claims data sharing. this notice is to occur during a beneficiary\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s first primary care visit and is in addition to current posting requirements and the availability of written notices upon request. we request that cms reconsider the notice means and timing as we believe any point of care notice at the physician offices is difficult to train and operationalize. in our experience, a point of care notice that is unrelated to the issue at hand creates room for error, becomes one of multiple point-of-care communications, and lends to beneficiary confusion, rather than clarity. instead, we would recommend that cms institute an annual beneficiary notification that includes an aco response line. in addition, since mssp retired a similar notice procedure in the past due in part to beneficiary confusion and provider burden, we would suggest that cms use a different and more user-friendly format for this notice and perform an evaluation of this form and process during its initial rollout.\n\n benchmarking methodology refinements\n cms is proposing to revise the risk adjustment methodology for adjusting the historical benchmark as well\n as to use regional factors when establishing and resetting benchmarks. in particular, cms is proposing to\n reduce the maximum weight used in calculating the regional adjustment from 70 percent to 50 percent and to cap the regional adjustment amount using a flat dollar amount equal to 5 percent of national\n medicare ffs per capita expenditures. cms will use the cms-hcc prospective risk scores to adjust the\n historical benchmark for changes in severity and case mix for all assigned beneficiaries, subject to a\n symmetrical cap of positive or negative 3 percent for the agreement period. in calculating the regional\n trend and update factors, cms will use a blend of regional and national growth rates based on medicare\n ffs expenditures with increasing weight placed on the national component of the blend as the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s\n penetration in its regional service area increases.\n\n e comment: consistent with our past commentary, we believe that the benchmark methodology of shared savings is flawed, in that shared savings models will not produce long-term savings. the mssp program is structured to give a bonus to high-cost providers who reduce spending, not reward cost- efficient providers who enter the program and keep costs down. an analysis of 2015 performance showed just how powerful the benchmark is: acos who generated savings not only had higher benchmarks, but also had higher per-capita spending than those acos who surpassed their\n page 7\n cms-1701-p unitypoint accountable care\n benchmarks.* although cms is trying to address this by altering the regional benchmarking blend, we are not convinced that this proposal goes far enough, particularly for beneficiaries in rural areas and environments with cost-based reimbursement. we would recommend that cms engage rural stakeholders to further explore benchmark methodology that accurately reflects cost of care versus cost of access. if this divide can be bridged, acos will become a viable service delivery platform option for rural beneficiaries.\n\n also, we cannot overstate the importance of accurate risk coding and cms should encourage and not penalize the accurate and detailed documentation of health status information. it should also be noted that accurate coding is a direct result of ongoing cms initiatives and policies that have encouraged ehr use and standards across healthcare providers and settings. we support the +3 percent symmetrical cap for acos in the basic track to encourage population health strategies beyond improved risk coding. for acos in the enhanced track, we would suggest that cms consider a benchmarking methodology akin to that used in the ma program.\n\n updating program policies\n cms is proposing to revise the voluntary alignment process, the definition of primary care services for\n beneficiary assignment and the quality and interoperability measures. cms is also soliciting input to better\n encourage acos to coordinate pharmacy care.\n\n e comment: to conform policy with section 50331 of the bipartisan budget act of 2018, cms will assign a beneficiary to an aco based upon their selection of any aco professional, regardless of specialty, as their primary clinician. while we agree that beneficiary choice is a preferable assignment method to claims-based attribution, we are concerned that this voluntary alignment will remain for the duration of the entire agreement period and any subsequent agreement periods under the mssp. at issue are proceduralists or episodic care specialists. for example, a beneficiary may voluntary align to an oncologist during a cancer episode, but no longer require care from that provider once the cancer is in remission. it would seem that cms may want to consider an annual election process for beneficiaries to voluntarily align.\n\n unitypoint health has been supportive of the meaningful measures initiative and applauds cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s efforts to streamline data collection and reporting. we provided specific comments on the current aco measure set during the rulemaking process for the cy 2019 physician fee schedule,? which included an overall reduction in the number of quality measures and a transition to outcome-based measures. we agree with the current proposal to replace aco-11 (use of certified ehr technology)\n with an attestation related to cehrt use \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 next generation acos have used this attestation approach successfully. additionally, we are pleased to learn that cms is considering an opioid use measure. for the resulting measure, we encourage cms to institute first as a reporting only measure before ramping up to a pay-for-performance measure to iron out any reporting inconsistencies and to allow\n\n\n 4 bielamowicz, l. acos still aren\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096t saving money for medicare. april 5, 2018. https://gisthealt

pathways to success proposed rule, which streamlines the medicare shared savings program. uph is one of the nation\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s most integrated healthcare systems. through more than 30,000 employees and our relationships with more than 290 physician clinics, 38 hospitals in metropolitan and rural communities and 15 home health agencies throughout our 9 regions, uph provides care throughout lowa, central illinois and southern wisconsin. on an annual basis, uph hospitals, clinics and home health provide a full range of coordinated care to patients and families through more than 6.2 million patient visits.\n\n in addition, uph is committed to payment reform and is actively engaged in numerous initiatives which support population health and value-based care. unitypoint accountable care (uac) is the aco affiliated with uph and has value-based contracts with multiple payers, including medicare. uac is a current next generation aco, and it contains providers that have participated in the medicare shared savings program (mssp) as well as providers from the pioneer aco model. as such, we are committed to the accountable care organization (aco) model and believe it has resulted in better care for our beneficiaries and a more flexible service delivery model for our providers. uac has submitted a separate comment letter on the substance of cms-1701-p.\n\n the purpose of this letter is to reiterate uph\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s interest in the evolution of acos beyond the enhanced track. we envision this new state as a model that combines

page 2\n executive summary: medicare advantage (ma) plus proposal\n the ma plus model is a proposal submitted to the cms innovation center that is designed to be the future of medicare service delivery. built upon the popular ma chassis, this provider integrated model seeks to promote the delivery of high-quality care to medicare beneficiaries and promote economic efficiency in the medicare program. the model respects the provider-patient relationship, offers a superior beneficiary experience as designed by providers and their patients, and removes barriers to delivering care that is high-quality, convenient, requested and timely.\n\n need\n medicare costs are a growing percentage of the federal budget. congress and regulators have mandated that the healthcare industry move to value and increasingly tie payment to quality and health outcomes.\n providers are overwhelmed with increasing healthcare regulations and desire to move to a stable payment environment. seniors in rural areas and elsewhere want affordable access to healthcare and fear reductions in coverage.\n\n solution\n the medicare advantage program is an increasingly popular option for seniors and has shown promise in curbing costs, quality outcomes and offering supplemental benefits desired by seniors. medicare aco models have succeeded in offering a differentiated patient experience through enhanced provider engagement and testing benefit enhancements and programmatic waivers. by further enabling ma with aco best practices, the ma plus model will enhance healthcare access, provide high-quality care and offer fiscal relief to the medicare program. the model prioritizes choice in healthcare, encourages marketplace competition and assists the government by lessening its role in healthcare administration.\n\n the ma plus model is proposed as a five-year pilot. model features include:\n\n e = eligibility limited to provider integrated ma plans, which require collaboration with a medicare aco and meaningful provider representation on the plan\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s governing body.\n\n e \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba=6attribution-based enrollment of beneficiaries related to their alignment with medicare acos is utilized with affirmative election to remain in fee-for-service medicare.\n\n e network adequacy requirements will allow alternative high-quality standards for tele-health and center of excellence designations.\n\n e the ma program will serve as the chassis \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 current ma payment rates and regulatory structure, except as to enrollment methodology and as otherwise defined in the proposal.\n\n e tailored beneficiary communication strategy and outreach related to plan benefits, cost and enrollment process will be implemented. marketing to non-attributed aco beneficiaries is prohibited.\n\n e acorisk scores for enrolled members will be utilized for the ma plus plan in initial years.\n\n executive summary: medicare advantage (ma) plus proposal\n e quality performance will be measured under the ma star measurement and rating system, with initial plans deemed as 3-star plans unless heightened aco quality performance merits a 4-star rating.\n\n e regulatory flexibility and applicable fraud and abuse waivers will apply to enable benefit enhancements and other practice flexibility.\n\n e a-apm status will be available for this model \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 ma plus plans will complete the all payer combination option application and ma plus revenue and patient count will be considered as part of the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3medicare only\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 threshold needed to maintain a-apm status under macra.\n\n for affiliated acos, this model proposes protections to address concerns that could stem from a reduction in beneficiary count as a result of attribution-based enrollment in the ma plus plan. these protections include waivers of minimum beneficiary count requirements; recalculations of the minimum savings rate; rebasing the benchmark; partial forgiveness of advance payment model obligations; recalculation of population based payment; ability to switch to lesser mssp program tracks; and ability to withdraw from the aco program.\n\n hypotheses under the auspices of the cms innovation center, the model proposes to test the following hypotheses:\n\n e heightened levels of beneficiary satisfaction are associated with the ma plus model;\n e =6attribution-based enrollment into the ma plus model is an accepted process for beneficiaries to transition from fee-for-service medicare;\n e the ma plus model is a preferred avenue for providers to enter into risk-based contracts, and transition to value-based payment; and\n e alternative mechanisms to achieve network adequacy for the ma plus model promote enhanced healthcare access and increase the adoption of ma plans in rural areas.\n\n timeline\n cms is requested to consider this proposal for a 5-year pilot period under the cms innovation center. as proposed, the pilot period will start january 1, 2020 and will conclude on december 31, 2024. applications for participation will be accepted on an annual basis.\n\n unitypoint health october 16, 2018 - page 2\n\n\n attachment 1: ma plus model

honorable seema verma administrator centers for medicare & medicaid services 7500 security boulevard baltimore, md 21244 re: medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-- pathways to success dear administrator verma: the undersigned national organizations dedicated to advancing effective mental health and substance use care in our nation thank the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) for the opportunity to comment, and would like to take this opportunity to offer several recommendations to support the accountable care organizations (acos) participating in the medicare shared savings program (mssp) in addressing mental health, addiction, and suicide in the individuals they serve. acos can play a critical role in addressing the growing overdose and suicide epidemics in the united states, but they need additional cms support. acos are currently incentivized to report on depression remission at twelve months (the only patient-reported outcome performance measure (pro-pm) across mental health, addiction, and suicide). according to the most recent public use file, among acos reporting this measure and excluding acos that reported a score of zero, the median rate of depression remission at twelve months in acos was approximately\n9%. a recent meta-analysis estimated that the rate of spontaneous remission at twelve months in \n an untreated population is approximately 53%.1 we do not have data on pro-pms related to substance use or outcomes related to suicide. acos need additional support from cms in addressing mental health, addiction, and suicide. the undersigned offer recommendations in three areas:\n1. promote behavioral health capacity in all acos \n cms should work with acos to ensure that each has the capacity to meaningfully address mental health and substance use in their population. the u.s. preventive services task force noted in 2016: in  2009,  the  uspstf  recommended  screening  all  adults  when  staff-assisted  depression  care supports  are  in  place  and  selective  screening  based  on  professional  judgment  and  patient preferences when such support is not available. in recognition that such support is now much more widely available and accepted as part of mental health care, the current recommendation statement\n 1 whiteford ha, harris mg, mckeon g, baxter a, pennell c, barendregt jj, wang j. estimating remission from untreated major depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis. psychological medicine. 2013 aug;43(8):1569-\n85. \n\n\n has omitted the recommendation regarding selective screening, as it no longer represents current clinical practice.2 while rates of depression screening have improved over the past several years, the poor performance on depression remission at twelve months indicates that there may be widespread gaps in post-screening follow-up. the same is likely true of addiction and suicide services. cms should support acos, using cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technical assistance, quality improvement, and learning collaborative infrastructures, as well as financial incentives, to implement effective mental health and substance use interventions that work in their practice context, such as the collaborative care model or other forms of evidence-based behavioral health integration using the newly created billing codes,3 certified peer support specialists and/or other forms of recovery support services, tele-behavioral health, and/or digital health interventions.\n2. explore ways to enhance data collection for patient-reported outcomes (pros) \n in mental health and substance use the majority of performance challenges in the depression remission at twelve months measure may be attributable to loss to follow-up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the aco was not able to screen a second time to determine if remission was achieved. data collection for mental health and substance use pros could be maximized and made more efficient by allowing individuals to screen at home. mental health and substance use screening could also be built into the beneficiary engagement incentives, so that repeated screening with an online portal integrated into the certified electronic health record technology is part of the incentivized healthy behaviors. this approach is especially salient as the evidence grows for measurement-based care and the value to patient outcomes for repeated mental health and substance use screening.4 cms should explore whether supporting acos in implementing home-based collection of mental health and substance use pros to determine if doing so allows acos to better follow-up and address the behavioral health needs of their population.\n3. offer additional outcomes-based payments in behavioral health \n additional investment in mental health and substance use services, supports, and infrastructure may help build new capacities and catalyze further innovation in acos. to ensure cost- neutrality for cms, cms can tie new payments to predicted future savings. for example, increased rates of depression remission likely predict savings to cms in reduced total health care spending over the next several years. cms could develop a methodology to share some of these predicted future savings with acos as they achieve specified behavioral health outcomes, assuming appropriate protections can be built in to avoid cherry-picking issues. note that the methods could be similar to those being used in the outcomes-based credits in the recently\n\n\n cms-approved maryland total cost of care model.5 with a methodology for sharing expected cms savings with acos, cms could justify outcomes-based investments in mental health and substance use care. conclusion the undersigned thank cms for the opportunity to comment and look forward to continuing to work with the administration on addressing our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s addiction and suicide epidemic. please do not hesitate to contact nathaniel z. counts, j.d., senior policy director of mha, at ncounts@mentalhealthamerica.net for follow-up or questions.\n sincerely, mental health america american foundation for

pool of acos moving along the risk continuum.\n pcpcc background and vision for primary care\n founded in 2006, pcpcc is a not-for-profit multi-stakeholder membership organization dedicated to advancing an effective and efficient health system built on a strong foundation of primary care and the patient-centered medical home (pcmh).  representing a broad group of public and private organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including payers, healthcare clinicians and other providers, leading corporations and patient and consumer advocacy groups \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the pcpcc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission is to unify and engage diverse stakeholders in promoting policies and sharing best practices that support growth of high-performing primary care to achieve the \u00e2\u0080\u009cquadruple aim\u00e2\u0080\u009d: better care, better health, lower costs, and greater joy for clinicians and staff in delivery of care.\n 2\n\n advanced primary care is the foundation for successful acos\n empowered primary care, as exemplified by the pcmh model and demonstrations such as comprehensive primary care plus (cpc+), create a team-based care structure and incent the population-based delivery approach that forms the foundation of successful acos.  key elements within the shared principles of primary care \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as an emphasis on health promotion and prevention, increased access to first-contact care, and partnering with patients to manage chronic conditions facilitate the focus on high-value care that is necessary for strong aco outcomes.  these interventions can reduce emergency department use and unnecessary hospitalizations and align incentives across the medical neighborhood to support outcomes in acos.\n pcpcc remains strongly committed to accountable care and appreciates efforts by cms to strengthen the program and move more participants to risk-bearing models.  we continue to believe there is a path forward for continued efforts to align a variety of cms programs designed to encourage high-value care and consumer satisfaction \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including both pcmhs and acos. many program rules and restrictions, quality measures, and reporting requirements could be better aligned to simplify participation for clinicians and better align incentives across programs.\n advanced primary care and the aco program\n recent research conducted by the pcpcc1 demonstrates the importance of pmch to acos achieving success. in a first-ever study of its kind, pcpccs 2018 evidence report examined the interaction between these two models through both qualitative and quantitative methods. the quantitative research showed that:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 medicare acos with a higher proportion of pcmh primary care physicians were more likely to generate savings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 mssp participants with more pcmhs showed greater average savings of up to 1.9 percent (see study for methodology/important caveats). these results, for acos with more pcmh pcp share, are notable given that the overall savings for all mssp acos in the study sample is 0.6 percent.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 medicare acos with a higher proportion of pcmh primary care physicians had higher clinical quality scores related to preventative screenings and services as well as chronic management (both diabetic and coronary artery disease composites).\n the research qualitatively showed that strong foundation of advanced primary care as embodied in the pcmh is critical to the success of care delivery reforms focused on keeping people healthy and preventing illness, managing chronic conditions to reduce hospitalizations and er visits, better meeting patient needs and preferences, and reducing costs, among other goals.\n 3\n\n with 10 percent of the us population in acos and growing, and more than 20 percent of primary care physicians practicing in pcmhs, these findings have widespread applicability for public and private policymakers as these programs continue to evolve. pcpcc is pleased to see recognition of this primary care impact from cms and encourages further effort to promote accountable care models based on a strong, advanced primary care foundation. more specifically, pcpcc encourages cms to build on this evidence to drive more mssp success by having acos report the percentage of primary care practices that have pcmh recognition and incentivizing a rising percentage of advanced primary care practices.  this would both strengthen the mssp program and build on congressional intent in the medicare access & chip reauthorization act.\n clinician-led alternative payment models\n pcpcc applauds cms attempts to make the aco program more accessible for low-revenue and inexperienced acos but encourages it to further consider glide-track options. the transition to value-based payment must be a system-wide transformation.  for this to be successful, there must be more opportunities and more accessible opportunities for practices and organizations to begin moving along the path to outcome-based payment. a narrow program that accelerates progress for some, but leaves many behind, will not meet our national ambitions to transform to a high-value, outcome-based healthcare delivery system. specifically \u00e2\u0080\u0093 additional and highly accessible alternative payment paths are needed for groups of clinicians who need time to gradually expand and experiment with risk-based payment in the merit-based incentive payment program (mips) before moving into more complex aco programs.\n pcpcc notes that the proposed rule does not mention comprehensive primary care plus (cpc+) practices participating in acos.  we believe that the cpc+ model is empowering practices to begin the transition to risk through care management fees and performance-based incentives.  as noted by our research mentioned above, these types of transformations are foundational to achieving success in accountable care models. cms should ensure that care management fees do not harm acos that are transforming primary care practices to encourage primary care investment and coordination with acos, until those costs are fully incorporated into the baseline and therefore the benchmark.\n specific responses to cms proposals\n voluntary and beneficiary opt-in alignment methodology\n pcpcc strongly believes that the foundational elements of a strong healthcare system, as espoused by barbara starfield, include first contact accessibility, coordination, comprehensiveness, and continuity.2  recognizing the importance of relationship-based care, we strongly support voluntary alignment which allows patients to select their providers and\n 4\n maintain a strong primary care relationship. we are pleased to see cms expand the number of qualified clinicians that the patient can select as a primary clinician, as this supports a strong, continuous relationship between the patient and their provider.\n while better engaging consumers in their care is an important goal, pcpcc does not believe the opt-in methodology provides adequate additional benefit to merit the added complexity that the opt-in process would create. we also believe that the focus on a consumer-clinician relationship in voluntary alignment to be a better attribution tool than the consumer selecting an aco directly.  pcpcc has concerns about the provider behavior that might be incented by a defined aco \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d period \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccherry picking\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009clemon-dropping.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  instead, cms should allow the voluntary alignment methodology to permit greater direction from the consumer, when appropriate.\n beneficiary engagement\n pcpcc believes that the opportunity to provide incentive payments to beneficiaries would be a strong tool to help consumers be more engaged and active participants in the delivery of their care.  strong safeguards would be required, however, to ensure that incentives are not abused to alter the composition of the patient panel through cherry picking\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009clemon-dropping.\u00e2\u0080\u009d pcpcc encourages cms to allow these sorts of incentives at the specific point of care, rather than as an aco-wide incentive. this would encourage behavior among active participants and help prevent incentives from being used as a recruitment tool.\n high and low revenue acos/experienced and inexperienced acos and the ramp-up to risk\n as noted above, pcpcc believes clinician-led acos, often \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-revenue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d have significant potential to transform the healthcare system.  we appreciate efforts by the administration to reduce administrative burden and allow greater access to shared savings for these organizations. a new england journal of medicine article by harvard medical school researchers recently found that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cacos that are physician groups have stronger incentives to lower spending than hospital-integrated acos ... after 3 years of the mssp, participation in shared-savings contracts by physician groups was associated with savings for medicare that grew over the study period, whereas hospital-integrated acos did not produce savings (on average) during the same period.\u00e2\u0080\u009d3   we believe that the move two-sided risk will help hospitals acos better align incentives and improve performance.\n as noted, we are concerned by projections that many acos would leave the program, and fewer would choose to enter it. ideally, we would like to see provisions for low-revenue acos spur much greater interest and participation in the aco program among organizations that cms would define as low-revenue and inexperienced.  we encourage cms to prioritize the entrance of new participants into the mssp program as it implements these concepts.\n\n 5\n pcpcc is strongly supportive of the additional flexibility in the aco program, and supportive of five-year agreements \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which would provide needed stability and transition time for acos.  we are concerned, however, that two years may not be enough time for a new aco to transition to a model that includes risk.   similarly, we believe that cms must provide adequate notice to participants as well as clear and deliberate timelines for any transition.  implementing significant changes mid-year is likely an unnecessary complication for participants.\n while not perfectly analogous, we believe that pcpcc research on pcmh practice transformation can help inform this decision \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as practice transformation is a key tool to success in accountable care. our 2017 analysis revealed that the longer a practice had been transformed, and the higher the risk of the patient pool in terms of comorbid conditions, the more significant the positive effect of practice transformation, especially in terms of cost savings.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe peer-reviewed findings \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 supported this claim in that a majority of the studies that looked at four years or more of data had positive results, whereas many studies looking at two years of data or less had missed or non-significant results.\u00e2\u0080\u009d overall, the data suggests that the longer a practice has been transformed, the more positive its impact on quality, cost and utilization.4 cms may want to take this research into account when considering a faster ramp- up approach for acos to accept risk.\n addressing critical behavioral health needs\n cms seeks comments on further developing the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality measure set in response to the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative as well as to support acos in addressing opioid utilization.  while pcpcc supports the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on opioid utilization, we believe quality measurement and incentives for accountable care organizations should be tied to broader patient outcomes.  pcpcc believes that cms has an opportunity to leverage meaningful measure 12 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the prevention, treatment, and management of mental health, which seeks to promote effective prevention and treatment of chronic disease.   this measure, which encourages effective integration with primary care through diagnosis, prevention and treatment of depression and effective management of mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), and dementia (e.g., alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease), has a huge potential to be transformative. a broader measure, that leverages continuous, relationship-based care in the primary care setting will be better able to sustain positive patient outcomes over time (including challenges with opioid abuse when relevant).\n pcpcc is also pleased to see the recent cms quality payment program quality funding announcement for measure development \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including the development of mental health and substance use measures under the leadership of the american psychiatric association. particularly important are the development of patient experience outcome measures.\n\n\n 6\n conclusion\n our multisector members look forward to working with you to support new and continued models that will drive higher-value care and improved patient outcomes.  please contact christopher adamec, director of policy at cadamec@pcpcc.org or 202-640-1212 with any questions.\n sincerely,\n\n\n ann

and proposes a way of extending mental health outcomes into childhood.  note that because social functioning and recovery are multidimensional constructs with complex determinants, we propose that accountability for the measures discussed here be at the population health management level (e.g. in comprehensive primary care plus-type arrangements) or even health care system level (e.g. in

proposed is composed of at least three scales: depression (with the phq-9 as the reference instrument), anxiety (with the generalized anxiety disorder 7-item (gad-7) as the reference instrument), and social functioning (with the promis satisfaction with social roles and activities (ssra) as the reference instrument). the depression and anxiety scales are used to screen for the presence of a mental health condition, and the ssra is used to measure improvement over time when need has been identified. using the linking methodology developed by the nih-funded prosetta stone project, all instruments for which empirical equivalency can be established with the reference instruments (e.g. phq-9 and gad-7) should be eligible for use in this quality measure, promoting flexibility for providers and

enhanced tracks as presented will stunt the growth of the aco program. presumably, cms seeks to encourage the growth of smaller or more rural acos since these are shown to produce more savings compared to larger acos (many of which are attached to a hospital). generally speaking, it takes 3-5 years to implement and tweak any new program and make it successful, especially if you are a new group. the truncated two-year glide path before risk must be incurred will lead to a lot of acos abandoning the program before they are able to fully implement a working program, especially considering the delays in data received from medicare (both the cclf data and the quarterly and benchmark data). in fact, with the extended reconciliation process, any aco will have to make the decision about whether to continue with the program shortly after they receive the first year's payment in october of their second year (if they are owed payment after the first year at all). i feel that the shortened timeframe, especially combined with the very low shared savings rate of max 25% will prove unattractive to many new acos. added to this, the burden of having a repayment plan in place before year 3 (again, shortly after they receive their first payment of max 25% if they are eligible for the payment in the first year) will shut out many smaller, more rural acos. smaller, more rural acos tend to have less resources than larger, hospital-based acos and may not be able to have the cash flow to both 1) support aco activities to produce savings and 2) have a lot of money tied up in escrow/surety bond to ensure repayment. if you seek to encourage smaller acos to apply, stay in the program, and flourish, you need to have a longer glide program available, perhaps the first 5-year contract can be risk-free before moving onto risk in a subsequent contract. this will also allow smaller acos enough time to shore up the cash for the repayment mechanism, should they need it

development of sound federal health care policy that fosters patient access to the highest quality specialty care, the undersigned members of the alliance of specialty medicine (the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3alliance\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5)\n write in response to proposals aimed at redesigning and providing a new direction for the medicare shared savings program (mssp) accountable care organizations (acos).\n\n general concerns\n specialist participation in acos\n despite a recent medicare payment advisory commission (medpac) analysis that found sixty percent (60%) of aco-participating physicians are specialists?, the alliance remains concerned that many acos have adopted \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3narrow networks\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 to inappropriately limit specialty physician participation. the lack of \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3network adequacy\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 standards allows this primary care-dominated model to essentially \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3bar\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 the participation of specialists, even when specialty physicians express an interest in joining the model.\n\n some acos have told specialists that the items and services related to the care they deliver is \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3expensive\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 and would be difficult to control, potentially having a negative impact on cost and resource use. in addition, the quality measures acos are held to are primary-care focused, leaving specialists with little opportunity to improve care and quality scores. specialists that are participants report their engagement as limited, if at all. in fact, the vast majority of specialists have been unaware of their aco participation status until they received notification through cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 quality payment program (qpp).\n\n specialty physicians are an essential and needed component of the health care system, and especially in the medicare program. specialists use their deep knowledge and expertise to reach a precise medical diagnosis, present the full array of available interventions, collaborate closely with their patients to determine which option is most appropriate based on their preferences and values, and coordinate and\n\n\n 1 http://www.medpac.gov/docs/default-source/reports/jun18 _ch8 medpacreport sec.pdf?sfvrsn=0\n manage their specialty and related care until treatment is controlled and/or complete. as such, it is essential that cms establish pathways for specialists to meaningfully engage in the aco program, especially as the program grows and as beneficiaries can opt-in to this model of care. in addition, we urge cms to provide acos with technical assistance that would allow them to appropriately analyze clinicial and administrative data, improving their understanding of the role specialists could play in addressing complex health conditions, such as preventing acute exacerbations of comorbid conditions associated with chornic disease. further, we urge cms to establish requirements that prohibit acos from restricting specialist participation. finally, as the agency continues to implement the qpp, we ask that cms publicly release data on the participation rates of specialists in acos (by percentage and specialty type).\n\n access to specialists\n cms monitors access to specialty care providers through its requirement that acos report data collected from beneficiaries via the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3access to specialists\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 module of the cg-cahps survey; however, we are concerned that this measure will not be enough to demonstrate whether beneficiaries are being referred to specialists at the most clinically appropriate point in their care. in fact, data collected through the survey could be unreliable as beneficiaries may be unaware that specialty medical care is necessary in order to properly manage a diagnosed health condition.\n\n early intervention and referral to specialists, when appropriate, drastically reduces the progression of certain chronic illnesses, such as rheumatoid arthritis or certain types of spine conditions resulting in neurological symptoms. to ensure beneficiaries receive important specialty care at the most clinically appropriate time, we urge cms to closely examine the referral patterns of acos and establish benchmarks that will foster an appropriate level of access to and care coordination with specialists, in addition to collecting feeback from beneficiaries on access to specialty care.\n\n emphasis on clinical data registries\n as part of its \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3meaningful measures\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 initiative and in the spirit of reducing regulatory burden, cms recently proposed to limit the number of quality measures reported by acos. we recognize the importance of addressing administrative burden, however, by relying on only a handful of broad-based primary care-focused measures, specialists are unable to demonstrate the value they bring to care epsiodes and end up being held accountable for aspects of care outside of their control and clinical focus.\n thus, it is imperative that measures reflective of specialty care are included in the aco program, which would incentivize acos to meaningfully engage specialists in their networks. to balance these priorities, cms should develop a measure (to be reported by acos) that would capture the percentage of physicians reporting to specialty-focused clinical data registries. such a measure would emphasize reporting to registries, as well as help acos assess the quality of specialty medical care provided by specialists in its network.\n\n specialty designation for non-physician practitioners\n specialty physician practices frequently retain non-physician practitioners, such as nurse practitioners (nps) and physician assistants (pas), to enhance and improve care delivery and care coordination activities. however, these mid-level providers are generally viewed as \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3primary care providers\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 by the medicare program and considered in the claims-based assignment methodology. as a result, an entire group of specialists not otherwise considered in the assignment methodology could be forced into exclusivity with a single aco if one of its mid-level providers under the same tax identification number (tin) is considered in the claims-based assignment methodology. to address this challenge, cms should adopt specialty designations for non-physician practitioners. that is, when nps and pas enroll in\n medicare, they should self-designate a primary specialty in which they practice. specialty designation for non-physician practitioners would also ensure appropriate attribution of care, as well as more objective quality and cost evaulations and comparisons across provider types.\n\n provisions of the proposed rule\n structual changes to the aco program\n cms proposes to significantly restructure participation options for acos, to include discontinuing track 1 (one-sided shared savings-only model) and offering a new basic track to facilitate the transition to incrementally higher performance-based risk. as we understand, specialists that have been able to engage in acos are participating in track 1 acos. therefore, cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096 elimination of this track will further hinder specialists from moving into alternative delivery and payment models.\n\n while many specialists will continue to participate in the merit-based incentive payment system (mips)\n track of the qpp, it is essential that pathways for specialist participation in the aco program increase.\n therefore, we urge cms to maintain the current one-sided shared savings-only model (i.e., track 1), particularly as acos increase their engagement of specialists in the model.\n\n revisions to policies on voluntary alignment\n the bipartisan budget act of 2018 requires the secretary to permit a medicare ffs beneficiary to voluntarily identify an aco professional as their primary care provider for purposes of assignment to an\naco. to meet the statute, cms proposes to modify its current voluntary alignment policies to provide that\n it will assign a beneficiary to an aco based upon his/her selection of any aco professional, regardless of specialty, as their primary clinician. specifically, a beneficiary may select a practitioner with any specialty designation, for example, a specialty of surgery, as their primary care provider and be eligible for assignment to the aco in which the practitioner is an aco professional. to accomplish this, cms proposes to revise \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba425.402(e)(2)(iii) to remove the requirement that the aco professional designated by the beneficiary be a primary care physician as defined at \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba425.20, a physician with a specialty designation included at \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 425.402(c), or a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist.\n\n by removing this requirement, we are concerned that physicians with a specialty designation not listed at \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba 425.402(c) would be subject to

proposed rule\r\ndear administrator verma,\r\naugusta care partners is an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\r\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos. these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community. as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations pathways to success.\r\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our acos finite resources.\r\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\r\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the acos total population, instead of differentiating between newly assigned and continuously assigned beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssps complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality, the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\r\nits no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administrations efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\r\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my offices operations.\r\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing high-quality and efficient care to our community.\r\nsincerely,\r\nclark b. bernard, m.d.\r\nneurosurgeon\r\naugusta spine clinic\r\naugusta care partners     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n

rule specifies that it will reduce the maximum regional benchmarking from 70% to 50% and apply it during the first agreement period. cms will use a blend of regional and national benchmarking based on aco penetration in their service area. applying regional benchmarking, especially in the first contract period for a new aco can be disastrous if the aco accepts historically high-cost providers (like physicians who provide snf services or home visits to homebound patients) into their group. if an aco attempts to work with several high-cost providers (who may exclusively see patients with an average cost of $30,000+ annually due to the severity of their illnesses), their historical aco budget may be as high as $20,000 per beneficiary per year. however, the regional costs may be $14,000 per beneficiary per year. applying a 25% regional cost will bring their financial benchmark down to $18,500. therefore, the aco would have to work much harder with these higher cost physicians to save $1,500 per beneficiary per year (a savings of 7.5%) to break even. they would have to save a further 2%+ to make any savings at all. if they manage to save an unheard-of 11%, they would only get credit for 3.5% and then only receive a maximum of 0.875% (which is 25% of 3.5%) out of a total 11% in savings if they also max out their quality scores. in fact, if they are in the enhanced or basic (year 3+) tracks, then they will have to save at least 5.5% to prevent having to pay medicare for losing money. considering most successful acos save only 3-5%, this would make it extremely likely the aco will have to pay back money, even if they manage to save money over historical costs. even if you use more conservative numbers ($15,000 historical benchmark and a $12,000 regional benchmark would result in a benchmark of $14,250, which still requires a savings of 5% to break even), it would still present a potentially insurmountable problem. in conclusion, regional benchmarking, particularly in the first contract period, makes it very unattractive for acos to even attempt to work with historically high-cost providers as these providers will greatly increase the difference between the regional and historical benchmarks to the acos detriment.", "0465": "create a distinct set of participation levels for mssp acos that serve as safety-net and are community based and operated. our non-profit aco makes up a minority of mssp acos, that serve almost exclusively low income and underserved populations in numerous hpsas. our aco, consists of a disproportionate share dual eligibles (16%) and disabled (33%), including over 220 esrd attributables. 39% of the beneficiaries in our aco are under the age of 65. we have over 400 primary care practitioners working out of 169 primary care centers; all but 7 are fqhcs. it should also be noted that many of the employed primary care practitioners are subsidized by national health services corp. even though our aco is not hospital-owned, we connect with 30+ hospitals in georgia.\r\n\r\nour participant roster changed dramatically as of january 1, 2018, removing a large, municipal hospital partner that would not execute on our aco value-based care strategies (strategies that none the less generated reduction of unnecessary medical costs by 5.6% on average for each year [2013-2016] performing below a benchmark less than 9000). the expansion took our aco from largely urban to predominantly rural, comprising the largest fqhc networks statewide. py 2017 was first year that the aco ran a deficit. for all surplus performance years, our aco generated approximately $11.6m in savings, with only $1.6m of the infrastructure investment recouped. it is assessed that the py2017 deficit was attributed in part, to the former large hospital systems failure to execute as described above and soft steered medicare beneficiaries into high cost, admission-generating, specialty care. further, the chronic disease prevalence trend within our cohort is 2-3 times higher than the national average, with higher than average emergency department utilization due to social determinants of health (sdh) barriers. safety-net acos are not special but are different. the question has been raised on numerous occasions by our aco board as to whether or not cms accounts for the all commensurate factors in the benchmarking methods relative to fqhcs? all things considered with regard to risk adjustment methods, it seems that without clarification of the benchmarking allocations as applied to fqhcs in particular, that risk assumed under any of the proposed level, would insufficiently funded in accordance with those outlined in the proposed ruling.\r\n\r\nregarding infrastructure costs, participant organizations (2 of 13 are non-profit) have invested over $5m since 2013. cmmi should reinstate the aco investment model (aim) to subsidize and shared the investment in ongoing development, innovation and management operations. for example, our aco analyzed early on that many of our the chronically-ill attributed beneficiaries were being managed, seemingly with disconcerting intention by hospital-based ers, that set the goal to divert medicare beneficiaries from the fqhcs for primary care. consequently, the forged collaboration resulted in a strong ed diversion program, all at the direct expense borne by the fqhcs and the non-profits. add to the proposed rule that the aim program be instituted, comprised largely of fqhc and community-based health centers (non-profit, non-hospital owned/operated). our aco has made significant strides in appropriating their hcc coding for more accurate risk assessment and adjustment. prior the acos formation, and despite the fact that most of the health centers locations participated in some level of vbr with medicare advantage plans, some organizations were not focused documentation accuracy until the training was made available by the aco. in this regard, our aco has reached exceptional milestones, and is beginning to see the return on the intended value of participating in the mssp: to have a sustainable and reliable infrastructure capable of performing consistently well under risk and maintaining triple aim objectives, but also not put government subsidized and other dollars at undue risk. the mssp should account for the extraneous and intensive cost to deliver not only clinical needs with high tech, high touch service, but social determinant needs, that are in excess and fall well outside of the calculated benchmark expenditures and go almost fully un/under accounted. our methods are well defined in our initial mssp application. earned shared savings were used to enhance such infrastructure but remain insufficient. the current benchmarking factors dont fully address sdh barriers which contribute to deficits as a result. it also seems that behavioral health (substance abuse and mental health) and social determinant of health are underfunded for disparate populations. we propose cms have a separate allocation of funding to address sdh and psychosocial needs (including to fulfill service shortage gaps). alter the regional benchmark to allocate more of the regional spend for fqhcs which could project and address the costs associated with sdh.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n

track 1+).\nfinalize the proposal to enact extended, five-year agreement periods.\nnot cut in half the shared savings rates for shared savings only acos and to apply the following shared savings rates: 50 percent for basic levels a and b, 55 percent for basic levels c and d, and 60 percent for basic level e.\nwe oppose requirements that high revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or any acos \u00e2\u0080\u0094 be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e.\nnot require any acos to participate in the enhanced track but keep that a voluntary model for acos prepared for higher levels of risk and reward.\nupdate the risk adjustment methodology by allowing risk scores to change by +/-5 percent over an agreement, as opposed to the proposed +/-3 percent range, and to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries.\nfinalize policies that support the move to regional benchmarking, including increasing the current maximum of 75 percent regional expenditures, and remove aco beneficiaries from the regional population and account for fqhc costs of social determinant of health intervention that may not be attested in historical claims payment but that could be attested through cost reporting.\nnot finalize the proposal to permit cms to terminate an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement if the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expenditures for the assigned beneficiary population exceed a certain amount after two performance periods.\nnot finalize the proposal to establish a june 30 deadline to voluntarily terminate aco participation agreements and not hold acos accountable for all shared losses if terminating after this date.\ncreate a policy that allows acos with agreements expiring in 2018 the option of extending their current participation agreements from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019.\nnot move forward with the proposed beneficiary opt-in assignment methodology and instead improve upon and enhance the current voluntary alignment process.  allow beneficiaries who receive services from fqhcs to have a full selection of providers from the aco provider supplier list by location, and expanding from the current pecos entries, because attributables should be able to select their practitioner at an fqhc location/site level versus the individual provider level.\nfinalize proposals to expand eligibility for the skilled nursing facility (snf) three-day rule and telehealth waivers, while considering additional waivers for acos to further engage patients.  allow waivers that provide for use of mobile applications that incentivizes (i.e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoints for rewards\u00e2\u0080\u009d) beneficiaries to further engage in self-management behaviors.\nfinalize proposals to

organizations-pathways to success, as published in the august 17th, 2018 federal register.\ni represent as the ceo of three acos in texas that are in the pre-participation period and intend to apply for the program year starting july 1, 2019. our aco participants is composed of independent physician practices and small acute care hospitals, some of them serving in the rural areas.\nas the national health care trend is now shifting from a volume-based care to a value and quality based care system; the medicare shared savings program (mssp) is progressing to have a potential impact to improve care for individuals, health for populations and reduce health care expenditures.\nhowever, the mssp is at an early development stage with a long path to success with currently only 10.5 million assigned beneficiaries into the acos (27% of a total of 38.3 million traditional medicare beneficiaries).\nwith only 27% assigned beneficiaries into mssp, it is to note that a high majority of remaining 28.5 million i.e. 77% of traditional medicare beneficiaries are unassigned into the acos. hence, we recommend considering with caution that any stringent changes to the mssp may hurt the progress already made and may also hurt the prospective growth of the mssp in the future.\nlisted below are our comments on the proposed rule changes.\nshared savings rate under basic track levels a

existing track 1 model the shared saving rate is at 50%.\ncomment: we strongly oppose the reduction of shared savings from 50% to 25% under the one-sided no-risk models. the proposed change will severely hamper the acos in current pre-participation period to consider withdrawing plans to apply to the 2019 mssp program year due to the lack of an opportunity to meet the operational overhead costs. our risks of loss outweigh the opportunity of shared savings incentives.\nstate of performance of mssp acos in all performance tracks. data source: data.cms.gov.\nperformance year\u0007\ntotal

annual operational overhead cost is expected to be 1.5 to 2 million us dollars. under the proposed minimum 25% sharing rate the mssp program will not be an appealing business model to make investments

loses of the year.\ncomment: on behalf of start-up acos starting their 1st performance year on july 1st, 2019, it is strongly requested that cms be merciful towards these acos during their 3rd year of program (i.e. the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1st year in risk track model) where the aco is required to glide into a mandatory risk track model.\nit is to note that the embargoed report on shared savings results of the basic track- level a and b may be released to the aco during the 3rd quarter of the following/next year. considering this fact on the release of embargoed report, and the fear of liability for prorated shared losses, it will be highly unpredictable for acos to judge their standing to either continue or voluntarily terminate from their 1st year of risk track model on or before the proposed june 30th date deadline. these acos will be forced to make an uneducated decision to discontinue/terminate their participation based on the incomplete quarterly cclf reports of first two quarters. so, it is strongly requested that cms extend the no penalty voluntary termination deadline from june 30 to september 30th, for acos in their 1st year of any risk track model, but

fiscal year (fy) 2019 proposed rule for the medicare shared savings program.  specifically, we would like to direct this comment on behalf of the 45 rural hospitals within the state of washington.\nwsha agrees that the transition to value-based care is key to realizing the triple aim within our health care system.  however, we are concerned that the proposed rule will make this transition much more difficult.  we understand cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in encouraging providers to move quickly towards risk assumption, but believe a period of upside-only risk is necessary to allow providers to move along the learning curve and achieve savings.\nwashington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rural providers are by-in-large small, independent hospitals with relatively low numbers of medicare enrollees.  their ability to find success within the aco model, let alone assume financial risk, is often hampered by a lack of ability to invest in the time, data systems and care redesign that must occur to be successful. many of our critical access hospitals lack the resources to make significant up-front investment in this area.  similarly, their fragile financial position makes the assumption of down-side risk prohibitive to participation.\nthe proposed rule creates unnecessary barrier for small and rural hospital participation.  while many have taken significant steps forward, others are just beginning to understand the change required to be successful in a value-based model.  a more gradual pathway is required for small and critical access hospitals.  we urge you to preserve an appropriate pathway to aco participation for rural hospitals, such as the one that currently exists in the aco investment model.\nwe thank you for the opportunity to comment on this

accountable care organizations.\r\n\r\nbackground\r\nthink whole person healthcare (think) is an independent primary care clinic in omaha, nebraska. think is track 1 medicare accountable care organization (aco) and maintains aco-like agreements with commercial payers. it is also a cpc+ clinic. thinks mission is to provide high-quality, low-cost care coordinated around the patients whole health. think aco achieved shared savings for the 2017 fiscal year.\r\n\r\nhaving opened its doors in 2015, think is still growing and attracting new patients and physicians as it continues to be the highest performing aco is nebraska.\r\n\r\ncomments\r\nthink strongly supports many of the provisions of the proposed rule, and we appreciate cms support to improve our efforts in providing accountable care. for example, we are very excited in the new agreement period to take on two-sided, as we feel this is the best way for an aco demonstrate its commitment to shared savings.\r\n\r\nthe only objection we have is to the amended rule regarding a cap of 3 percent for annual risk adjustment, located at 425.605 of the proposed rule. by placing acos in a 5-year agreement period but capping the benchmark increase for hcc risk to 3 percent over the life of the agreement, cms will restrict acos from seeking out and caring for unhealthy patients. it will also discourage efforts to train physicians and providers to treat and document conditions and diagnoses. finally, for acos competing with fee-for-service providers, this cap handicaps our ability to draw both new patients and new providers. let us explain why.\r\n\r\nas a coordinated care clinic, think specializes in those patients with multiple chronic conditions and complex health outlooks. it is these patients who put the most financial strain on the medicare system, and more importantly, are in the most need. thinks primary care approached, supported by care coordinators, pharmacist and specialist professionals, keeps these patients from expensive hospital and er visits, maintaining health and improving their conditions. by capping risk score adjustment over a 5-year period, cms would punish our efforts to reach and target those patients who are the sickest, most expensive, and most in need of coordinated care. moreover, as we all know, as patients age they become more expensive to care for. indeed, an acos very proficiency in care quality will necessarily extend patients' lifetimes, making them more expensive to treat. in the end, cms's well-intentioned cap will discourage treatment of the sickest and oldest patients, for fear that those patients necessarily become even sicker and even older, without appropriate risk adjustment.\r\n\r\nour mission is maintained by ongoing efforts to retrain physicians to accurately document and code for the whole patient they see. providers in americas fee-for-service system are incentivized and used to coding for singular procedures or visits, not overall conditions. think spends a lot of time with physicians teaching them to document for diagnoses that help identify patients in need of special attention and extra resources. this benefits cms by reporting an accurate and timely picture of the health of its medicare populations, but this is only possible if incentives are in place to accurately and regularly document patient claim forms. the cap deters those efforts.\r\n\r\nand finally, as a growing practice looking to attract new patients and new providers, think would be penalized by this cap rule. acos are still relatively new and in drawing both patients and physicians from the fee-for-service systems into a value-based program, acos restricted by the cap will be in jeopardy of taking on more patients and sicker patients without being scored correctly to account for them. this will mean the costs of new patients brought by new providers will be allocated to think, but the risk score will not be accounted correctly for years to come. as cms looks to transition more of the medicare population to value based programs, its calculations should not discourage that goal.\r\n\r\nrecommendations\r\nwe understand the reason behind the 3 percent cap is to prevent gamesmanship by acos trying to increase their benchmark inappropriately. but to do so at the expense of those acos like think that are actively treating the sickest and most expensive medicare patients is counterproductive. we suggested a flexible cap or a higher one, perhaps of 10 percent over the agreement period. other options might be regular auditing

2018\n the honorable seema verma administrator centers for medicare & medicaid services\nu.s. department of health and human services \n hubert h. humphrey building 200 independence avenue, s.w. washington, dc 20201\n re: (cms-1701-p) medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations--pathways to success: submitted on october 16 ,2018 via www.regulations.gov\n dear administrator, verma:\n palm beach accountable care organization (pbaco) appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed rule, (cms-1701-p) medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations--pathways to success\n pbaco represents over 1,200 physicians and affiliated providers as well as 79,000 assigned beneficiary lives.  pbaco has well executed the triple aim through the medicare shared savings program (mssp) including contributing $34m in 2017 and $144m in total from 2012-2017 to the medicare trust fund; both the highest nationally in the mssp.  our py 2016 and 2017 quality scores were 98.08% and 99.32% demonstrating that our network of physicians is very committed to higher quality and patient experience. our mission is for our independent physician lead aco to excel in value based programs and to reward member physicians for high quality and efficient patient care for them to maintain their independence. the virtue of the shared savings/shared risk programs is that our incentives and outcomes are aligned; we comment with shared benefit and long-term program sustainability in mind.  we hope that medicare looks on these comments favorably and through the same light of partnership.\n below are cms proposals and pbaco recommendations.\n proposed: level a thru e basic aco cms proposal: 1st dollar savings at a rate of up to 25% based on quality performance; not to exceed 10% of updated benchmark increasing to 50% for level e. pbaco recommendation:  we do not support the proposal of 25% shared savings for basic aco levels a and b and argue that 25% shared savings is not enough financial incentive for aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to realistically start an aco enterprise, adequately fund operations and succeed in proposed shared savings programs at levels a and b. we believe that quality and sequestration adjusted 50% of shared savings for level a and b (closer to 45% on average) has demonstrated modest financial benefits to successful acos and hardly a windfall considering the near 25% shared savings success rate of first year starter acos. please use our pbaco and our historical $144m contribution to the medicare trust fund as a goal of the incentive and consider the consequences of stifling the initiation of future organizations with this potential.  please consider the below sizeable startup costs that were required to kick off pbaco operations.\n 2\n our aco benefited from former value-based experience, prevalent in florida, and an understanding of what level of investment/commitment would be required to be successful.  this level of investment/commitment created immediate business risk and pressures to be successful to cover these operational expenses as well as to earn adequate shared savings to compensate participants for value- based efforts.  we argue that the mssp would benefit from more initial investment/commitment from startup acos and the subsequent creation of this business risk.  we have unfortunately observed acos nationally with two or less employees for extended periods of time.  this can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen in the future and we support mssps intention to consolidate acos who do not have adequate investment/commitment and ultimately business risk and are not contributing to programmatic goals.  we argue that reducing initial shared savings rates to 25% for basic aco level a and b may have unintended consequences of stifling aco financial incentives to make adequate investment/commitments to have long term success. we support that mssp can attain the goal of consolidation by maintaining the 50% shared savings rate for basic aco levels a and b and finalizing many of the proposals such as to transition to downside risk as soon as year two, stricter risk standards for high revenue and experienced aco applicants, as well as higher levels of maximum losses.  however, we close that this particular proposal of a 25% initial shared savings rate may have negative long-term programmatic consequences of eliminating the incentive for high performing acos, like our pbaco in 2012, to launch, make adequate startup investments/commitments prevent them from producing long results for medicare beneficiaries and the medicare trust fund. cms proposal: we are proposing an approach that separates the choice of beneficiary assignment methodology from the choice of participation track (financial model), and that allows acos to make an annual election of assignment methodology: pbaco recommendation: we strongly agree with cms to allow acos to select prospective or retrospective assignment irrespective the track and to allow changing assignment methodology annually. we have formerly commented with our support of the flexibility our perceived predictability of retrospective assignment particularly for acos in transient markets (e.g. snowbirds).  thank you for listening!  we will simply state we believe prospective assignment to be a business risk and urge acos considering this methodology to research the transient nature of their market beneficiaries and to anticipate the frustration of participant physicians who are accountable for assigned beneficiaries that have not been seen by an aco physician (depending on the time of year) for 24 months or greater.  the maximum gap in visits for retrospective assignment to be possible is 12 months and is the absolute threshold of our physician participant tolerance.\n 3\n this policy was introduced in 2017 because of natural disasters impacting mssp acos in 5 states. the policy went through the formal proposed commenting period before impacted acos received their performance results to understand the true extent of the things we could not account for without data. using the claims data and analysis of florida acos performance results after the impact of hurricane irma, acos realized that there are things that could not have been forecasted. for example, no one ever expected fourteen patients would die at the rehabilitation center at hollywood hills when it lost air conditioning during hurricane irma because it did not have a backup generator for its air conditioner, but this is only one example of unforeseen tragedies and how it factors into the reality of extended admissions and length of stay because \u00e2\u0080\u0098unsafe place of discharge\u00e2\u0080\u0099 becomes a real concern because of systemic impact of evacuation, power outages and flooding at both facilities, patient homes and caregivers. this comment letter makes recommendations on the following points:\n\n1. final reconciliation results; the policy should not only mitigate shared losses but provide parity \n for the msr and mlr for acos who just missed their msr or exceeded their mlr because of the natural disaster and associated there in-part a costs;\n\n2. quality measures reporting for all acos impacted by a natural disaster, not just those who \n cannot report quality data; and\n\n3. the opportunity to identify natural disaster related impact at the beneficiary and claims level. \n\n mitigating shared losses for acos participating in a performance-based risk track\n 4\n example 1: track 1 aco impacted by disaster: 1.5% increase in annual per capita expense\n furthermore, please see the below example of track 2 aco that has annual per capita expense above their benchmark but below their 3% mlr and experiences a natural disaster that causes a 1.5% increase in annual per capita expense.  had this aco not experienced a natural disaster and the py continued as projected in q1-q3, the aco would have received $0 shared losses.  unfortunately, under the proposed rule, they will pay significant shared losses. the current proposal does not mitigate the impact of the natural disaster relative to the benchmark/mlr and this aco experienced a catastrophic increase in shared losses. example 2: track 2 aco impacted by disaster: 1.5% increase in annual per capita expense\n 5\n we suggest that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad for affected acos and bad for mssp program sustainability when 100% year to date shared savings or 100% shared losses are at risk to natural disasters that are out of the control of acos (as illustrated in the above two examples).  to be clear, we support more program performance accountability and the transition to downside risk but only under circumstances under an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control. unfortunately, pbaco was affected by a natural disaster in september 2017, with hurricane irma.  we observed an increase in medicare services and annual per capita expense due to actual impact of the natural disaster to beneficiary health/safety/anxiety.  we additionally observed an increase in expense due to the waiver of medicare requirements under the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency act and the enhanced benefits offered to medicare beneficiaries when the hhs secretary declares a public health emergency (phe) exists in an affected state.  simply put, when a pfe is declared, the stafford act offers more medicare benefits with less restrictions and an expected higher overall cost. https://www.cms.gov/about-cms/agency-information/emergency/epro/past-emergencies/hurricanes- and-tropical-storms.html the below chart, calculated by medicare cclf data, shows an increase of 9%-21% in inpatient admissions/1000 and snf admissions/1000 during the natural disaster period. while these 9%-21% increases in monthly admissions are profound, the impact during the most severe days of hurricane irma (september 9th \u00e2\u0080\u0093 14th) were more significant including 200% or more increases in the daily average of inpatient and snf admissions as compared to the august 2017 through october 2017 average. a1001 py 2017 results in ip admits/1000 and snf admits/1000.\n 6\n 7\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 recommend the removal of beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expenditures for beneficiaries who resided in a disaster area during a disaster period while the impact of hurricane irma to pbaco was unfortunate, it is far from the worst observed natural disaster in recent years.  we suggest that these comments extend existing rules seeking comment under the current proposed rule to offer more mitigation of uncontrollable per capita expense under extreme and uncontrollable circumstances as it pertains to benchmarking/msr/mlr.  we believe that this extension will be effective protecting mssp participant acos, mssp program sustainability and the medicare trust fund.\n modification of quality performance scores for all acos in affected areas: we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughtful analysis and proposals related to accounting for the impact of a natural disaster on an impacted acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 quality score.  natural disasters can have a significant negative impact on both aco process and outcomes measure scores. as an example, for process measures, it is not uncommon during a disaster for scheduled annual wellness visits to be canceled \u00e2\u0080\u0093 due to either clinic closure or beneficiary evacuation. in some instances, these visits aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t subsequently rescheduled which leads to missed opportunities to provide preventative care and identify emerging issues that require care coordination.\n we have three recommendations:\n\n1. use a \u00e2\u0080\u009chigher of the\u00e2\u0080\u009d methodology for substituting an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unaffected quality score from a \n historical py.  this is the methodology used by medicare advantage, referenced on page 8 below in the 2019 draft policy; https://www.cms.gov/medicare/prescription-drug- coverage/prescriptiondrugcovgenin/downloads/2019-technical-notes-preview-2.pdf\n2. remove impacted beneficiaries through a claim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identifier; or \n\n3. remove beneficiaries from the areas and during the period identified as being impacted from the \n natural disaster from the numerator/denominator or from the quality measures claims sample.\n\n for outcomes measures like readmissions, the impact is immediate and significant. as an example, below are 30-day hospital readmissions rates compared to prior years for two acos in florida that were in areas declared a federal emergency management agency (fema) major disaster for hurricane irma.\n 8\n\n\n hurricane irma made landfall in florida between september 10th and 11th 2017. not surprisingly, compared to 2016 (which was not impacted by a natural disaster) the aco, as illustrated in the charts above, saw a significant spike in readmissions because of the storm. these readmissions come from both the home setting and skilled nursing facilities. from the home setting, families or caregivers who are evacuating the area will commonly attempt to have a frail beneficiary readmitted to the hospital through the emergency department or direct admission from a primary care physician as the family/caregiver is unable to provide a safe recovery place during the evacuation. similarly, for situations where the family/caregiver attempts to shelter-in-place they will commonly have emergency services take the patient to the hospital due to loss of electricity which can lead to a clinical exacerbation of respiratory issues.\n it is also not uncommon for patients to be readmitted from skilled nursing facilities during a natural disaster. unfortunately, as has been well documented1,2,3 across the country, many of snfs and their staffs are ill-equipped to provide a safe environment in the wake of a natural disaster. this further contributes to elevated readmissions rates that are beyond an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control as frail patients are transferred to nearby hospitals that are better equipped to care for them.\n generally, we support the proposal that when an aco is unable to report quality measures it receives the mean aco quality score for the year it is impacted. however, we believe that the proposal can be logically modified from using the mssp mean aco quality score to using the aco specific mean or unaffected quality score.  this proposal has precedent as referenced in the \u00e2\u0080\u009chigher of the\u00e2\u0080\u009d language cited from page 8 of the below medicare advantage draft policy. https://www.cms.gov/medicare/prescription-drug- coverage/prescriptiondrugcovgenin/downloads/2019-technical-notes-preview-2.pdf\n\n 9\n hedis measures with a numeric result receives the higher of the 2018 or 2019 measure stars (and corresponding measure scores).\n we are concerned that assigning the mean aco quality score will disadvantage mssp participants with historically high-quality scores. therefore, we strongly recommend that for acos in disaster areas who have been in the mssp enough time to develop a quality \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrack record,\u00e2\u0080\u009d mssp use the quality score from the \u00e2\u0080\u009chigher of the\u00e2\u0080\u009d affected performance year or the prior performance year.  we support the proposal of using higher of the affected performance year and the mssp mean quality score in cases when no prior performance year quality score is not available.\n we offer the below illustration to increase the priority of our logical modification of the existing proposal. it demonstrates what an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s py 2017 quality, unaffected, was and assumes a negative impact of 5 percent during py 2018 during extreme and uncontrollable circumstances (e.g. hurricanes florence and michael). we believe that the middle row is the expected outcome of the proposal to use the mssp mean quality score and its impact on an aco with average/medium quality.  this aco would have had the mean quality score prior to the extreme and uncontrollable circumstance and subsequently is adjusted back to the mean through the proposal (demonstrated in the hurricane assistance column).  the top row demonstrates the impact of the proposal to an aco performing high quality where their unaffected quality score was very high, and their affected quality score is still above the mssp mean.  acos with historically high quality are unfortunately unassisted in the current proposal.  our biggest concern is the impact of the current proposal on acos with historically low quality.  unfortunately, and we expect unintended, low performing acos are unjustly awarded the mssp mean quality score when they had never historically achieved such results and hypothetically would have never achieved such results.  assuming these example acos achieve shared savings, the below illustration further defines the negative impact of the proposal to the medicare trust fund as $300,000 is unjustly paid to the low quality aco.\n\n\n our proposal of using \u00e2\u0080\u009chigher of\u00e2\u0080\u009d language from the referenced medicare advantage draft policy appears to adequately address all three scenarios and can be logically modified by using the aco specific mean vs. the mssp mean.\n we wish to further illustrate the impact of extreme and uncontrollable circumstances to florida in 2017, specifically hurricane irma, with the below example.  the examples show readmissions data above are proven more broadly by comparing the 2016 to 2017 \u00e2\u0080\u009cfail rates\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the all-cause and snf readmissions measures (aco-8 and aco-35). \u00e2\u0080\u009cfails\u00e2\u0080\u009d represent a 0 score which is assigned to acos whose performance falls below the 30th percentile.  the table below provides the comparison of the number of florida acos who \u00e2\u0080\u009cfailed\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the all-cause readmissions (aco-8) and snf readmissions (aco-35) measures for 2016 (which was not impacted by a natural disaster) and 2017 (which was impacted by hurricane irma).\n\n 10\n 2016 2017 percentage increase all cause readmissions (aco-8) 9 20 122.22% readmissions from snf (aco-35) 9 12 33.33%\n while the national fail rate for both measures increased, the increase was significantly greater in florida which suggests the fail rate in florida was negatively impacted by a localized trend like hurricane irma. nationally, the increase for all-cause readmissions (aco-8) was 71.64%, compared to 122% in florida. for readmissions from snfs (aco-35) was 20.25% nationally compared to 33.33% for florida acos.\n this is particularly relevant if you consider the below current mssp scoring policy and how it relates to acos who drop below the 30th percentile.  any aco with individual measure quality scores 30+ percentile or greater receive 55% of the possible points.  any small negative impact to the measure score that pushes it <30 percentile results in a 0% score.  this non-linear nature of the current methodology represents a significant vulnerability of quality scoring to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances.  note: we support this methodology under normal circumstances.\n\n\n this is particularly true for claims-based measures and similar to the all-cause readmissions measure (aco-8) or the snf readmissions measure (aco-35).  we believe that our proposal of using \u00e2\u0080\u009chigher of\u00e2\u0080\u009d language from the below referenced medicare advantage draft policy appears to adequately address all three scenarios and can be logically modified by using the aco specific mean vs. the mssp mean.\n from page 8: hedis measures with a numeric result receives the higher of the 2018 or 2019 measure stars (and corresponding measure scores). https://www.cms.gov/medicare/prescription-drug- coverage/prescriptiondrugcovgenin/downloads/2019-technical-notes-preview-2.pdf\n the impact of the current rule creates a misalignment in the program that rewards low performing acos by providing a higher mean score that has a negative impact to the trust fund, is relatively close for medium quality acos and unintentionally penalizes high quality acos with the readmission measures.\n in summary, we are proposing parity for the quality measures reporting enabling a reconciliation for high quality acos and average quality acos to the current proposal.\n 11\n\n1. use a \u00e2\u0080\u009chigher of the\u00e2\u0080\u009d methodology for substituting an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unaffected quality score from a \n historical py.  this is the methodology used by medicare advantage, referenced on page 8 below in the 2019 draft policy; https://www.cms.gov/medicare/prescription-drug- coverage/prescriptiondrugcovgenin/downloads/2019-technical-notes-preview-2.pdf \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 removing impacted beneficiaries, or timeframe when 1135 waivers or emergencies are declared, from readmissions-based measures; or \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 removing part, a claims identified through natural disaster codes from readmissions or utilization-based measures.\n 12\n transportation unable to drive due to wind speeds and patient safety concerns without electricity, flood, caregivers who evacuated or unsafe conditions.\n\n1. unsafe place of discharge: after hurricane katrina, natural disaster payment modifiers were \n introduced in 2005. there was a policy change in 2012 that \u00e2\u0080\u0098it no longer may be used at the provider or supplier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discretion. use of the dr and cr condition code will be mandatory for any claim for which medicare payment is conditioned on the presence of a formal waiver,\u00e2\u0080\u00994   this institutional code enables acute and post-acute facilities to use these payment modifier codes for claims submission and payment where the billing would otherwise be out of compliance (e.g., ordering replacement dme such as oxygen tanks for a copd patient or discharging a patient to a snf without a two-night admission preceding the discharge).  we feel the definition of these modifiers must be expanded or a new natural disaster payment modifier should be created to help isolate the extreme or uncontrollable events by claim or beneficiary during a natural disaster. there should be away for the health care providers of service or stakeholder to communicate these patient level details to cms, especially if they agree to be accountable for cost and quality of care.\n the policy changes in 2012 pose a challenge for acos as part a costs spike immediately before, during, and after a natural disaster. the society for academic medicine published a report that after a mass casualty incident (mci), hospital los was 4.9% longer for the mci surge cohort and\n 4 source: chapter 10 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 use of the cr modifier and dr condition code for disaster/emergency-related claims (rev. 2999, issued; 07-25-14, effective: 01-01-12, implementation: 08-25-14) https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and- guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c38.p\n 13\n $8,342 more expensive than a non-mci surge patient cohort.5  further, the annals of emergency medicine published a study that compared the first 30 days of medicare claims data from the southern zip codes affected by a deadly rash of tornadoes on april 27, 2011, with claims from the rest of the year and showed hospitalizations rose by 4% during and post the storm. with hurricanes, there is a longer lead time for evacuation and families caring for the frail and elderly medicare patients, particularly those with a recent hospitalization, are returned to the hospital for safety. many family members and patients do not have a safe place to evacuate with access to the care they were receiving at home. this is supported by the spike in readmissions (as illustrated by the data included in the quality section) that was observed for acos in florida during hurricane irma. we strongly recommend expanding the use of the dr code as a payment modifier to identify \u00e2\u0080\u0098unsafe place to discharge\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which would provide a beneficiary-level identifier for cost, utilization and quality measures (aco readmissions measures which are claims based.)\n\n2. timing of claims submission: at the time of an extreme event or natural disaster, a facility is \n working tirelessly to address the patient surge, transfer patients who have clinical needs that cannot be met under emergency operating conditions and meet a myriad of other community needs. training health system providers to use these codes is not common. given the infrequent nature of these events providers focus their scare training resources for revenue cycle staff to remain in compliance with medicare and medicaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever-evolving billing regulations. therefore, at a time when providers are pushed beyond capacity to manage patient care during emergencies there is no routine revenue cycle workflow to ensure the disaster modifiers are accurately assigned.  only in instances where a biller knows a claim is out of compliance for payment, may the workflow to add the code be triggered. given these challenges, our recommendations are twofold to protect mssp participants from adverse financial outcomes that are beyond their control because of a natural disaster. first, cms should expand the use of the natural disaster payment modifier codes to capture unsafe places of discharge. second, cms should allow for an additional 6-12 months to correct and resubmit claims to ensure they include the natural disaster modifier as appropriate.  (a lot of this analysis could not come to light until cms had publicly released the final reconciliation in august.) this would enable acos as stakeholders to analyze the claims feed they receive to identify patient admissions and discharges that may have been impacted by the natural disaster. potentially impacted cases can be reviewed with patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 physicians. the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s provider is the closest to the patient and can accurately identify impacted patients ensuring the natural disaster modifier is assigned correctly. then the aco can work with the appropriate facility to resubmit the claim. this creates alignment with the facilities who otherwise run the risk of unfairly receiving hospital readmission and mips penalties as well. it also increases the accuracy of beneficiary reporting at the claims level. with this proposal, an aco would have accountability and cms would have the tools to identify and remove claims during the final reconciliation addressing cost and utilization as well as from readmission- related quality measures.   this will ensure that it mitigates the unintended extreme part a impact from natural disasters where patients could not be safely discharged to a skilled nursing facility or home due to\n 14\n lack of electricity, flood or unsafe conditions that cause spikes in admissions, increased length of stay and readmissions are omitted. cms proposal: we believe that the proposed modifications of the snf 3-day rule waiver would provide additional incentives for acos to participate in the shared savings program under performance-based risk and are necessary to support aco efforts to increase quality and decrease costs under performance-based risk arrangements: we propose to add a new section of the shared savings program regulations at \u00e2\u00a7 425.613 to govern the payment for certain telehealth services furnished\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. by a physician or practitioner participating in an applicable aco.\n 15\n\n cms proposal: whether we should create an alternative beneficiary assignment methodology, to promote beneficiary free choice, under which a beneficiary would be assigned to an aco if the beneficiary has \u00e2\u0080\u009copted-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d to assignment to the aco. pbaco recommendation: pbaco does not believe that another complexity be imposed on acos. beneficiaries that want to opt into the aco should be automatically included into the aco without any need for the maintenance of additional lists.\n cms proposal: we propose to permit eligible acos to apply to establish a beneficiary incentive program during the july 1, 2019 application cycle or during a future annual application cycle for the shared savings program. pbaco recommendation: we supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a beneficiary incentive program for certain acos. as discussed above, such patient engagement tools are critical to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to better manage a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care. while we support this proposal, we have concerns with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to implementation, which would require the aco fully fund the costs of such a program. there are numerous upfront costs required to establish and maintain an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations. acos invest these dollars to support the model and efforts to transform patient care, sometimes never realizing these investment costs. those acos that do earn shared savings do not see such funds until years after the upfront investments have been made. therefore, it is unreasonable to expect the aco to fully fund the costs of such a program, and we urge cms instead provide such funding as is the case in the next generation aco program. minimum, cms should consider funding the program for the first year to support the cost of running such a program.\n pbaco believes that the incentive programs should be of a targeted nature and should contribute to reduction or control of chronic conditions. example: providing diabetes patients with an electronic hba1c monitor. cms proposal to provide an incentive of $20.00 to all assigned patients is flawed since this method will not increase the number of patients visiting pcps. when patients are provided incentives for actions such as visiting their primary care physician for a post hospital discharge visit with copays waived we will find patient costs being closely monitored.\n 16\n including apis using a minimum of fhir 2.0 to further speed up population analytics and real time interoperability. basic certification will be a dis-service to advanced acos that are taking considerable risk. even today several ehr venders believe that they have until end of 2019 to be minimally certified. among the 458 vendors certified to date approximately half are completely certified with functioning apis using fhir 2.0. cms, we recommend a more diligent process to decertify ehrs that are non- compliant.\n cms proposal: the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical benchmark is determined according to \u00e2\u00a7425.601 except as follows: (a) the benchmark is adjusted for changes in severity and case mix between by 3 and cy 2019 based on growth in prospective hcc risk scores, subject to a symmetrical cap of positive or negative 3 percent as described under \u00e2\u00a7425.605(a)(1) or \u00e2\u00a7425.610(a)(2). pbaco recommendation: the current mssp policy that treats beneficiaries differently depending on whether they are considered newly or continuously assigned creates unnecessary confusion and complexity. cms is in effect limiting risk adjustment due to demographic factors for continuously assigned beneficiaries. it is unreasonable to assume a provider organization, however effective, can manage a population such that patient conditions never worsen over time and it never carries a higher disease burden. therefore, we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to eliminate the newly and continuously assigned beneficiary categories and recommend additional changes to the risk adjustment proposals.\n though we appreciate the agency allowing risk score increases, the selection of 3 percent is arbitrary and insufficient when applied across a five-year agreement. for example, if an aco starts in july 2019, the most that the risk score used in the updated benchmark calculation can change in performance year six (2024) would be between 97 to 103 percent of the 2018 risk score (based on 2017 hcc coding practices). this risk adjustment proposal would be reasonable in early years of the agreement period, when most acos would hit the 3 percent cap, but it would not be reasonable when applied to later years of the agreement. using mssp py 2017 results, 87 percent of acos would have had at least one enrollment type trigger the +/-3 percent cap when looking at the first three years of the agreement period. the average percentage capped in the first performance year of the agreement period is 88 percent, in the second performance year is 85 percent and the third performance year is 92 percent. over the fourth and fifth performance years we would expect the percentage of acos affected by the risk score cap to increase. we recommend cms finalize a policy that allows risk score adjustments during the agreement period, but we urge a more reasonable threshold of +/- 5 percent and specifically a variance of 1% per py this is the threshold at which the percentage of capped aco populations within the same enrollment type drops below 25 percent based on the 2017 mssp results.\n we recommend cms adjusts their existing proposal by capping increases in risk scores in aggregate instead of by individual enrollment types (e.g. esrd) resulting in a broader +/- 5 percent cap to further promote benchmark stability.\n finally, to reduce benchmark volatility, the risk adjustment model version should be consistent between the baseline and performance years. for example, the version 23 cms-hcc model could be used when comparing risk scores in the 2016-2018 baseline period to those in the 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2024 performance period. the next generation aco program follows this convention demonstrating that it is administratively feasible to maintain a consistent risk adjustment model version throughout the baseline and performance periods.\n 17\n 18\n nonsensical and, more importantly, harmful to the majority of program participants. we urge cms to modify its policy by changing the definition of the reference population to exclude all aco-assigned beneficiaries.  to address those acos whose reference population falls below 5,000 after removing the aco-assigned beneficiaries, we recommend cms use a modified approach to reach 5,000 beneficiaries in those instances. for example, cms could bridge the gap by increasing the weight of the counties that have a lower proportion of resident aco beneficiaries, and thus higher ffs population.\n cms proposal: we welcome comments on the new codes we are proposing to add to the definition of primary care services used for purposes of assigning beneficiaries to shared savings program acos. in addition, we seek comments on our proposal to revise our method for excluding services identified by cpt codes 99304 through 99318 when furnished in a snf. we also seek comments on the other proposed technical changes to \u00e2\u00a7 425.400(c)(1)(iv). we also welcome comments on any additional existing hcpcs/cpt codes that we should consider adding to the definition of primary care services. pbaco recommendation: pbaco agrees with cms for including add on codes 96160 and 96161, prolonged evaluation and management or psychotherapy service(s) beyond the typical service time of the primary procedure (cpt codes 99354 and 99355), addon codes 99354 and 99355, prolonged services codes 99354 and 99355 when the base code is a primary care service. we are also in agreement to include depression screening and alcohol screening in a primary care setting. pbaco is also in agreement for the inclusion of the three hcpcs codes as assignable codes.\n pbaco would like to comment on the billing of ccm codes and using ccm codes for assignment of primary care services. it is the experience of our aco based on practices in the aco that regularly bill ccm services we have observed the following: a) there is drastic drop in quality scoring due to remote admin of the ccm. b) there is a disconnect between the pcp and the patient since the pcp now does not have direct face to face contact for extended periods of time.\n our research of ccm requirements require that a face to face visit take place every 12 months.  it is our observation that ccm services are performed, at least for part of the year, without any performance year face to face visit.\n we propose that the relation of ccm to primary care service and aco assignment should require a face to face visit during the performance year.  in the event that no face to face visit occurs during a performance year with an aco participant, ccm are not counted as primary care services.  in the event that a face to face visit occurs during a performance year, ccm are 100% counted as primary care services.\n we believe that ccm is an excellent complicate with face to face primary care services but acts in no way as substitute with this combined remote and face to face care coordination plan. sep< thank you for your consideration of our comments and allowing us the opportunity to provide feedback on this nprm.  we believe that they are responsible to medicare ffs beneficiaries, our providers, and the medicare trust fund. sincerely,\n\n"}
