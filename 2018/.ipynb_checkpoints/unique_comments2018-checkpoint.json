fully accounting for patient factors.  implementing such a model too quickly, however, will likely have harmful effects on participation that act to increase rather than decrease medicare spending. in short, the proposed convergence of aco benchmarks within markets could cause the voluntary mssp to unravel, particularly when additional risk-bearing is imposed. thus, we believe that the primary goal of the mssp at this stage should be to reduce excessive spending so as to cause convergence in spending between providers and allow future consideration of a longer-term model in which payments might be set regionally as in medicare advantage.  as long as the mssp is voluntary and there is wide variation in spending, this goal can only be attained by strongly encouraging the participation of providers serving patients who receive less efficient care and establishing strong incentives for those providers to reduce wasteful spending.  below, we summarize and then detail our key concerns, their empirical and conceptual bases, and our recommended changes to the rule. we sincerely hope our analyses and comments are helpful in your deliberations and would be happy to discuss them further.\n summary our chief concern is that the combination of requiring risk for spending in excess of benchmarks (downside risk) and earlier blending of historical benchmarks with average regional spending via the regional adjustments will introduce even stronger incentives for acos with high spending for their patients to exit the mssp and for providers with already low spending to remain in or join the mssp. such systematic selection has already occurred and will grow worse as regionalization of benchmarks and downside risk are imposed. there is strong evidence of strategic participation decisions by acos already (summarized below).  if the mssp is to cause convergence in spending by encouraging acos with high spending to reduce wasteful care, it needs to retain and attract providers with high spending and give them strong incentives to lower it.  although downside risk and regionalized benchmarks strengthen incentives to save, only providers who participate will be exposed to the stronger incentives.  as acos with high spending exit and those with low spending enter and continue in the mssp, acos will appear to be performing better against their benchmarks (ostensibly greater savings per program metrics) but the true impact of the program will be a substantial increase in medicare spending in the form of subsidies to already more efficient acos. to the extent that risk-adjustment is incomplete, regionalizing benchmarks will also cause unmerited financial transfers from providers serving healthy and socially advantaged patients to those serving sicker and disadvantaged patients.\n 3\n particularly among physician groups and acos with high initial spending.2,3,4,5  while incentives have been very weak and should be strengthened, we believe that it is important to refine the mssp in ways that build on those early gains rather than risk reversion and a squandering of providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 demonstrated willingness to try to reign in excessive spending.\n therefore, while we agree with the goal of strengthening incentives to save, we recommend a direction that differs from the proposed rule in key respects.  specifically, to encourage participation and foster convergence in spending while the mssp remains a voluntary program, we recommend eliminating regional benchmark adjustments, eliminating the rebasing of benchmarks that has greatly diminished aco incentives to ever save, and increasing the shared savings rate according to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending relative to their regional average.  given the evidence that physician group acos have generated greater savings than larger hospital-integrated organizations, we agree with the spirit of proposed provisions that favor participation by low-revenue groups but would go even further to do so.  specifically, we recommend that requirements to assume downside risk be applied only to acos with high revenues on par with those generated by health systems providing inpatient, outpatient, and specialty care (i.e., accounting for a high proportion of medicare spending for their patients).  lower-revenue acos should still be able to elect downside risk in exchange for favorable regulatory treatment and higher shared-savings rates.  program results and design should be revisited regularly, with monitoring of within- market spending variation to guide consideration of a longer-term payment model at a future time.  such an approach would establish strong incentives for all acos to lower wasteful spending, regardless of initial efficiency, by allowing acos time to recoup up-front investments and by eliminating penalties (in the form of lower benchmarks) for achieving savings.  such an approach also would afford the time necessary to modernize risk- adjustment methods to address \u00e2\u0080\u009cupdcoding\u00e2\u0080\u009d and unintended consequences for disparities.\n in addition to these core recommendations, we also offer suggestions for improving the methods for risk adjustment, trending benchmark updates, addressing compositional changes in aco provider participants, and determining aco organizational revenue.\n in summary, we believe a conclusion that the mssp has been a failure after 6 years of operation is inappropriate. the incentives for participating acos to lower spending have always been weak\u00e2\u0080\u0094the program can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have failed if there was never much opportunity for success. moreover, the mssp has generated meaningful savings from physician groups, for whom the incentives have been stronger.  ideally at the outset, the program would have had sufficiently strong incentives to allow more definitive judgment of its success.  delivery system reform is a slow process, and the voluntary nature of the mssp limits the options for strengthening incentives, but incentives to save in a voluntary program can be strong without discouraging participation.  for these reasons, we believe that the proposed changes to aco benchmarking and risk-sharing are premature and counterproductive and that other available strategies should be pursued to accelerate progress.\n 4\n key points \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the mssp has generated net savings to medicare \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 benchmarks are not valid counterfactuals \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 regional blending of

for assessing program \n savings, base assessments of program impact solely on studies that are well designed to estimate it.  benchmarks need not be redesigned to be valid counterfactuals\u00e2\u0080\u0094their purpose is to set incentives\u00e2\u0080\u0094but they should not be used for program evaluation.\n2. set the shared-savings rate at a minimum of 50% for all acos in all performance years \n and tracks.\n3. eliminate rebasing of benchmarks that links an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new benchmark to its spending \n changes in the prior period.  this link should be severed completely.  instead, an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original baseline should be updated annually according to a growth rate that is unrelated to its prior performance, adjusting for changes in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participating providers.\n4. eliminate regional adjustments that blend aco historical benchmarks with regional \n spending.  replace with shared savings rates that rise continuously with lower aco spending relative to its region, starting at 50% for acos with the highest spending for their region and rising to 80% for acos with the lowest spending for their region.\n5. eliminate downside risk requirements for lower-revenue acos by retaining track 1, \n eliminating the basic track, and allowing voluntary participation in track 1+.  replace the \u00e2\u0080\u009cclinician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d basis for determining loss limits in track 1+ with the proposed revenue-based determination (revenue/total spending for aco population).\n6. continue to require high-revenue acos to assume downside risk commensurate with \n the enhanced track but set the threshold for defining high revenue at a higher level corresponding to an integrated health system. also require downside risk of very large physician groups with market power. rather than rely solely on participant lists, use additional data on full organizational structure to determine organization-wide revenue for core practices responsible for attribution.\n7. eliminate cap on downward benchmark adjustments that result from decreases in risk \n 5\n average in the future (not in the near term per recommendation 4), implement additional payments or benchmark adjustments so that acos are not penalized for serving higher-risk patients.\n8. remove an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed population from benchmark update determinations to \n preserve incentives for acos to lower spending. use multilevel statistical modeling approaches to estimate aco-specific update factors that reflect regional and national trends, with greater weight placed on national trends for aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that serve higher proportions of patients in their service area.  after a phase of program expansion, switch to using a desirable preset rate of benchmark growth applied to all acos.\n the mssp has generated net savings to medicare the use of benchmarks to assess the impact of the mssp on medicare spending has caused much confusion about whether the mssp has produced savings to medicare net of bonuses and the extent of those savings.  program benchmarks are important because they establish the incentives for acos to participate and lower spending.  but understanding aco responses to those incentives requires rigorous evaluation in which spending for aco- attributed patients is compared with spending that would be expected to have occurred in the absence of aco participation in the mssp (the counterfactual).  benchmarks are not valid counterfactuals for a variety of reasons, several of which have caused benchmark- based assessments to underestimate savings in the mssp (at least through 2016).  first, until 2017, benchmarks were updated with the use of national spending growth rates (in absolute dollars/year).  because medicare spending growth varies geographically, this feature of benchmark setting meant that an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark differed systematically from its counterfactual (expected) spending in almost all cases.  the direction of the bias has differed for acos in areas of faster vs. slower spending growth, and the average effect has been to significantly underestimate expected spending because the national growth rate (updated factor) was determined among all ffs medicare beneficiaries, including those with no primary care services to support attribution.  beneficiaries with no qualifying services, on average, have much lower spending and thus lower spending growth rates in absolute terms.  for example, we estimate that medicare spending growth from 2013 to 2016 was $140/beneficiary slower among all beneficiaries than among those with at least one office visit with a primary care physician. based on this difference, the national growth rate used to set benchmarks underestimated spending reductions achieved by acos for their primary care patients from 2013-2016 by approximately 1.3 percentage points.\n second, any spending reductions achieved by acos contribute to a slowing in national spending growth, causing benchmarks to fall.  for example, based on our most recent analysis of mssp savings,6 spending reductions achieved by the 2012-2014 entry cohorts of acos caused their benchmarks in 2015 to be approximately 0.3 percentage points lower than if they did not lower spending.  third, rebasing of aco benchmarks at the outset of second agreement periods that lowers benchmarks according to the extent of spending reductions achieved in the first period causes benchmarks in the second period to diverge even further below counterfactual spending, causing further underestimation of savings. this occurred for the 2012-2013 entry cohorts when they began their second agreement\n 6\n periods in 2016.  other features of benchmark setting have had less predictable effects but also could have contributed to underestimation of savings. for example, the approach to risk adjustment has appropriately tried to address other program goals, such as mitigating incentives to increase diagnosis coding intensity, but in the process may have not accurately reflected changes in the health risk of patients served by acos.\n for these reasons, analyses using aco benchmarks to quantify mssp savings are uninformative and should be ignored when assessing program savings.  benchmarks are of obvious importance in establishing incentives and determining performance bonuses but are not valid counterfactuals and yield highly misleading results when used to assess program impact.  for example, whereas benchmark comparisons would suggest that the mssp caused cumulative net losses to medicare of $266m in 2014 and 2015 (including shared-savings bonuses), our evaluations, which use local concurrent spending changes to establish counterfactual spending, more accurately quantify the impact of the program as generating $431m in cumulative savings to medicare over those two years after accounting for bonuses \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a $697m difference from benchmark-based savings estimates.  these greater savings are also consistent with market-level analyses conducted by government analysts and other researchers (including those summarized in the regulatory impact analysis of the proposed rule).  the review of the evidence in the regulatory impact analysis is at odds with characterizations of one-sided contracts in the mssp (e.g., on\np.41787) as an unaffordable option that increases medicare spending. \n\n although the direct savings we estimated are modest, the total savings to medicare are greater because of spillover effects.7  changes in care for patients attributed to acos are likely to affect medicare beneficiaries served by acos but not attributed to one.8  moreover, reductions in ffs medicare spending achieved by acos in turn lower payment rates to medicare advantage plans.  particularly because of the large size of the growing medicare advantage program, these spillovers are substantial, approximately doubling the net savings to medicare from the mssp based on our previously published calculations.9\n moreover, the savings have varied with the strength of incentives to which acos are exposed, suggesting that refinements that strengthen incentives without compromising participation would lead to greater savings.  in particular, we have consistently found that savings are significantly greater among physician-group acos than hospital-integrated acos.10,11,12,13  because physician groups provide less of the care spectrum, they have much\n 7 mcwilliams, j. (2016). \"savings from acos\u00e2\u0080\u0094building on early success.\" annals of internal medicine 165(12): 873-\n875. \n 7\n stronger incentives to reduce spending.  all else equal, acos have stronger incentives to lower spending on care they do not provide than care they do provide.  when acos lower spending on care they provide, any resulting shared-savings bonuses are offset to some extent by foregone fee-for-service profits.  similarly, spillover effects on non-aco patients (including commercially insured patients) have greater financial consequences for larger hospital-based acos.  if a primary care-focused aco implements systemic care redesigns to reduce excessive inpatient or specialty care for all of its patients (not just those covered by its mssp contract), it does not incur losses in revenue for non-aco patients.  thus, physician groups have much stronger incentives as acos to lower spending and to implement more systemic changes that affect care for all patients. not only have savings been convincingly higher for physician group acos but they have also been growing over time consistently in each mssp entry cohort.12  in our analyses, we have also confirmed that the greater savings estimated for physician groups are not due to those acos being located in higher-spending or higher-use regions or having higher spending for their regions (we obtain similar results when adjusting for those factors).  because physician groups effectively have a higher shared-savings rate (because they incur lower offsetting costs when lowering spending), these findings foreshadow the additional savings that may be realized if shared savings rates are increased.\n savings have varied with strength of incentives in other ways, too.  for example, savings have been particularly pronounced in post-acute care, a leading source of waste in medicare which most acos do not provide and thus almost universally have strong incentives to limit.  in addition, assuming the costs of reducing spending are lower when spending is higher (where there is more waste it is easier to cut), savings should be greater for acos with higher baseline spending for their region or in higher-spending regions. indeed, that has been observed as well.10\n recommendation 1: because benchmark-based calculations are not informative for assessing program savings, we urge cms to base assessments of program impact solely on studies that are well designed to estimate it. benchmarks need not be redesigned to be valid counterfactuals\u00e2\u0080\u0094their purpose is to set incentives\u00e2\u0080\u0094but they should not be used for program evaluation.\n current incentives weak for reasons other than lack of downside risk there is near-universal agreement that incentives have been weak in the mssp, but the discourse has focused almost exclusively on the lack of downside risk in mssp contracts as the cause of weak incentives.  the proposed rule intends to correct this perceived flaw by requiring currently participating high-revenue acos to assume significant downside risk immediately by entering the enhanced track, requiring new high-revenue participants to enter the enhanced track after 5 years, and requiring all new entrants and continuing low-revenue acos to assume some downside risk after 2 years of participation in the basic track.  however, there are other major reasons why incentives to lower spending have been weak in the mssp and thus other options for strengthening them.\n 8\n imperfect quality scores reduce the shared savings rate, it has been even lower, averaging\n44.2% in 2014 and 47.8% in 2017.  such shared-savings rates offer limited opportunities to \n profit relative to the status quo because acos incur substantial costs from being an aco and attempting to earn shared savings.14 these include the costs of aco governance and quality reporting, efforts to lower spending and improve performance on quality measures, and (if those efforts are successful) any offsetting losses in profits as described above. accordingly, the proposed reduction in the shared savings rate to 25-35% for acos in all levels of the basic track except level e is likely to eliminate opportunities for acos to save on net, reduce aco investments, and therefore reduce the savings to medicare generated by acos and attract fewer acos into the program.\n second, the rebasing of the historical component of aco benchmarks every 3 years to reflect an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most recent 3 years of spending greatly diminishes acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 incentives to ever save because spending reductions now are penalized with lower benchmarks later.15 to the extent that the costs of lowering spending are fixed (e.g., upfront investments with permanent effects on spending), rebasing reduces the time acos have to recoup those costs.  to the extent that the costs of lowering spending are variable (must be incurred each time spending is reduced), expending effort to reduce wasteful services in a given year might contribute to shared savings for that performance year (if the minimum savings rate is exceeded) but will definitely cause the benchmark in the next agreement period to be lower and below the expected spending level under a status quo in which the effort is not expended again.  thus, in a contract with symmetric upside and downside risk, variable cost interventions (even if effective) pose a present-day net cost to acos.15\n for example, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say it costs a physician group aco $1000 in care manager salary to prevent one $10,000 hospital admission through patient monitoring and timely engagement, diverting patients away from emergency departments and to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary care practices when possible.  for simplicity, assume 1-year agreement periods. the aco will receive $5,000 in shared savings for a net $4,000 savings from such effort in the first agreement period, but its benchmark in the subsequent period will be lowered by $10,000, posing a $5,000 future loss (assuming 50% shared losses) and thus a net $1000 present day cost from the care manager\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort if the aco plans to stay in the program for a second period.  the aco can expend the $1000 in care management again in the second period to avoid the penalty (it no longer produces a bonus from doing so because the benchmark is lowered), but as long as it participates in the program it must do so indefinitely, in every year of participation, to avoid the penalty (because spending will rise back to its previous level if the variable cost is not incurred).  thus, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incentives are either to never try to prevent admissions or to try to do so and then leave the program.16\n the key point is that acos have had little incentive to ever lower spending because of the link between the spending reductions they achieve and subsequent benchmarks. one could argue that it is astonishing that the mssp has produced any savings at all.  not surprisingly,\n 9\n dropout in the 2012 and 2013 entry cohorts of acos was most marked when their benchmarks were set to be rebased at the start of their second agreement periods in 2016. specifically, 44 of 191 acos (23%) left the program between 2015 and 2016 after annual exit rates averaging just 6.6% from 2013-2015 over the first agreement period.\n recommendation 2: set the shared-savings rate at a minimum of 50% for all acos in all performance years and tracks.\n recommendation 3: eliminate rebasing of benchmarks that links an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new benchmark to its spending changes in the prior period.  this link should be completely severed.  instead, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original baseline should be updated annually according to a growth rate that is unrelated to its prior performance, adjusting for changes in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participating providers.\n two concerns have been raised about the approach we are recommending, but we believe they have received too much weight in deliberations over mssp rules to date and are addressable.  first, without rebasing aco benchmarks down to their more recent levels of spending, some have commented that this will allow acos with initially high spending to eventually earn windfall profits.  we agree that some high-spending acos would be able to earn sizeable shared-savings bonuses eventually and believe that a principal goal of the mssp should be to avail such opportunities.  but shared savings are not equal to profits for the reasons we note above; they may be largely offset by the costs of lowering spending17 and program participation.  for many acos with initially high spending, particularly high- revenue acos that incur offsetting losses in ffs profits when restricting provision of care, the mssp may merely offer an opportunity to mitigate those losses as they lower spending to levels of efficiency offered by other providers in their area.  that may nevertheless be a goal of providers with high spending, particularly if they know with greater certainty the long-term direction of medicare payment policy.  but they will be unlikely to participate and pursue that goal if the costs are made too great by downside risk and regional blending.  as we discuss below, concerns about an uneven playing field between acos with higher vs. lower spending in the same market can be addressed by increasing the shared- savings rate for more efficient acos.  in addition, under both the current and proposed rules, benchmarks will be progressively reduced by the annual benchmark updates as the program matures and expands, because regional and national spending growth will progressively slow as acos increasingly lower medicare spending.  thus, the annual updates will still apply downward pressure on aco benchmarks, thereby limiting aco profits.  the key distinctions are that, with rebasing eliminated: 1) the downward pressure on benchmarks would be at a rate that appropriately lags behind the downward effect acos have on spending as opposed to at an equal rate (thereby encouraging participation); and 2) the downward pressure on a given aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark would not be caused by its own efforts to lower spending (thereby strengthening incentives to save).\n second, concerns have been raised about the ability to adequately adjust for changes in aco provider composition over longer periods of time.  an inability to do so could allow acos to select more efficient practices (taxpayer identification numbers [tins]) for\n 10\n inclusion to earn shared savings without lowering spending.  more generally, the clinicians and practices represented by a given tin may change substantially because of mergers and acquisitions, and tins may newly appear or cease to appear in claims.  these challenges can be addressed with relatively straightforward approaches, several of which we have implemented in our evaluations of the mssp.18,19  when an aco adds tins to their participant list, the baseline period for those tins could be established as the 3 years prior to the addition (i.e., different parts of the aco would have different baseline periods).  for tins that exhibit large changes from baseline to performance years in the number of clinicians billing under them or that newly appear in claims, npi-tin billing relationships can be used to identify additional tins in the original baseline period to assess baseline spending for a set of providers that is more consistent with an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participant list in a given performance year.  for tins where provider consistency between performance and baseline years is tenuous and cannot be corrected with such methods, rebasing could be allowed for the portion of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark accounted for by such tins.  moreover, to the extent that the mssp encourages acos to include more efficient providers in their contracts, that may help foster competition among providers to be efficient and attractive to acos.  thus, such behavior should not necessarily be viewed as wasteful gaming.\n problems with regional benchmark adjustments and evidence of cost- increasing participation decisions in the 2014 cohort the regional adjustment in the current benchmarking methodology, particularly when implemented in an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first agreement period as proposed, is highly problematic in a voluntary mssp, particularly if downside risk is imposed on participants.  it will surely lead to exit by acos with spending above their region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s average.  these acos with high baseline spending have produced greater savings than acos with lower spending18,20 and are critical to retain and attract if the mssp is to ever cause sufficient within-market convergence in spending to facilitate a transition to a longer-term payment system in which providers bear risk and population-based benchmarks are similar for different providers in the same market (accounting for patient factors).\n there is evidence already of acos with high spending for their region selectively exiting the program in response to the prospect of regional benchmark adjustments.  as noted in the proposed rule, the 25-35% blending of acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 historical benchmarks with regional average spending led to substantial swings in benchmarks in 2017 for acos that started in 2014.  this was to be expected from the documented wide variation acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk-adjusted spending relative to their service areas.21   as described in the table below, introduction of the regional adjustment in 2017 was associated with 21% dropout in the 2014 cohort and more than a quadrupling of the mean \u00e2\u0080\u009csavings rate\u00e2\u0080\u009d among remaining participants (from\n0.5% to 2.2%).  the \u00e2\u0080\u009csavings rate\u00e2\u0080\u009d indicates where an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending was relative to its \n benchmark, with positive values indicating that spending was below the benchmark.  to distinguish this quantity from estimates of actual aco savings estimated by rigorous evaluations, we refer to this quantity as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbenchmark savings rate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the increase in the\n 11\n benchmark savings rate in 2017 for the 2014 cohort (bolded in the table) was the most substantial increase observed in any entry cohort in any pair of years and thus unlikely due to improvement in aco performance alone.  the other year-to-year increases in benchmark savings rates were much more modest, including those associated with rebasing and extensive dropout in 2016 for the 2012-2013 cohorts.  of the remaining acos from the 2014 entry cohort, 81% had positive regional adjustments in 2017, meaning that their historical benchmarks were below average regional spending and thus that their participation was subsidized.  this pattern is highly suggestive of selective dropout of acos with spending above their regional average, causing the appearance of increased savings that would be more accurately characterized as subsidies to acos with lower spending.\n\n\n\n entry year 2015 performance 2016 performance 2017 performance n

claims data, we confirmed that acos in the 2014 cohort that exited the program in 2017 had substantially higher spending for their region than those who remained in the program.  specifically, we fit a model of total spending per beneficiary in 2014-15 as a function of county and year fixed effects and fixed effects for acos in the 2014 cohort. the latter set of fixed effects estimated the mean spending difference between each aco in the 2014 cohort and its service area.  this spending deviation was, on average, $787/beneficiary higher for acos dropping out than for those remaining in the mssp.\n 12\n we understand that the costs of lowering spending are likely greater for acos with lower spending (less \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-hanging fruit\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and that acos already providing more efficient care have voiced concerns that basing benchmarks solely on acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 historical spending creates unfairly greater opportunities for providers who have been historically less efficient. providers who are more efficient than others, however, are not necessarily efficient.  for example, in our empirical work on low-value care in medicare, we found that providers who provide the least low-value care still provide more low-value care than the difference between the most and least efficient providers.22,23  therefore, acos with low spending for their region should be able to reduce wasteful spending further, but likely require greater rewards to cover the higher costs of doing so.  therefore, to retain and attract acos with lower spending and to recognize their greater level of efficiency and the greater challenge they face in further reducing spending, we recommend replacing the regional adjustment with higher shared savings rates for acos with lower spending for their service area.  this could be implemented in a graded fashion, with shared savings rates rising continuously from a minimum of 50% for acos with the highest spending for their region to 80% for acos with the lowest spending for their region, using the most recent 2 years to assess acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 standing relative to their region.  relating the shared-savings rate to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 most recent level of spending will also strengthen incentives for acos to lower spending.\n it is important to recognize that higher shared savings rates do not mean lesser savings for medicare.  first, higher shared savings rates should attract more providers into the mssp. so even if medicare receives a lower proportion of the savings for a given aco, there should be more acos generating savings. second, higher shared savings rates should elicit stronger efforts by acos to lower spending.  to date, acos with spending below their regional average have not produced significant savings.  therefore, increasing the savings rate for an aco with low spending for their region can only increase savings to medicare from that aco, on average. third, because a higher shared savings rate does not apply to savings from spillover effects (e.g., lower medicare advantage payment rates), increasing the shared-savings rate will reduce the amount of savings to medicare from a given aco with a given performance level much less than the change in the percentage would indicate.\n finally, it is also important to bear in mind that most acos provide only some of the care spectrum (lower revenue acos).  these acos tend to be primary care or multispecialty physician groups.  thus, much of the inefficient care delivered to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population may not be provided by the aco.  accordingly, such inefficient care offers opportunities for efficient physician groups to enter those communities and reduce spending as acos.\n recommendation 4: eliminate regional adjustments that blend aco historical benchmarks with regional spending.  replace with shared savings rates that rise continuously with lower aco spending relative to its region, starting at 50% for acos with the highest spending for their region and rising to 80% for acos with the lowest spending for their region.\n\n 13\n downsides of downside risk not only can incentives in the mssp be strengthened without imposing downside risk for spending in excess of benchmarks, but downside risk may ultimately strengthen incentives very little and will likely cause more problems than it solves, acting to diminish instead of increase savings to medicare.\n as a preliminary point, it is important to recognize that track 1 is not riskless.  as described above, all acos incur significant administrative and reporting costs to participate in the mssp, and those that try to lower spending or improve quality incur additional costs.  these costs pose a potential downside even if the risk-sharing is one- sided.  acos lose money if they fail to earn sufficiently high shared-savings to offset the costs of participation and effort to achieve savings.  as evidence that track 1 is a downside risk track, the rate of dropout from the mssp has been substantial, and acos that have dropped out are disproportionately those that did not receive shared-savings bonuses. specifically by 2018, 40-45% of acos in the 2012-2013 entry cohort and 35% of the 2014 cohort had exited the mssp.  benchmark savings rates were substantially lower among acos dropping out than among those staying in the program.  in the 2012-2013 cohorts, for example, the mean benchmark savings rate among acos that have dropped out was\n0.37% before they dropped out, compared with 1.44% among those continuing in the \n program.  if track 1 were riskless, acos not receiving bonuses would stay in the program. given that dropout has been substantial and driven largely by the limited performance-based risk already present in track 1, we should expect that additional downside risk in the form of two-sided risk sharing will accelerate dropout and discourage participation.\n 14\n that provisions that would further discourage participation by acos that do not perform well against their benchmarks (downside risk and regional adjustment of benchmarks) would be detrimental to the program.\n since the enhanced track is essentially the pioneer model, the 50% dropout rate observed in the pioneer model should also serve as a cautionary tale about the extent of voluntary participation that should be expected in the enhanced track.  (only 16 of the 32 pioneer acos remained in two-sided models [pioneer or next generation] by 2016). limiting participation in the mssp by high-revenue organizations, however, may prove to be sound policy if a goal of the mssp is to foster competition by offering shared savings opportunities that appeal selectively to smaller organizations and physician groups.\n as another point of evidence that is important for considering downside risk requirements, recent assertions that the downside risk tracks (2, 3, and now 1+) have caused greater savings are misleading and we believe incorrect.  some analysts, including the medicare payment advisory commission,24 have observed that acos participating in tracks 2 and 3 have higher benchmark savings rates and have concluded that downside risk elicits greater savings.  however, only a small percentage of acos have participated in track 2 or 3 (8% in 2018), and most of them transitioned into these tracks after experience in track 1 (as of 2015, 99% of acos were in track 1).  thus, these acos were able to select into track 2 or 3 to take advantage of the higher shared-savings rates after ascertaining that their spending would continue to be below their benchmarks, whether because of preceding success in lowering spending or other factors that cause benchmarks to deviate from counterfactual spending.  indeed, of the 32 acos that transitioned from track 1 to track 2 or 3 by 2018, the mean benchmark savings rate was 3.6% over the 3 years prior to changing tracks, vs. just\n0.6% among other acos remaining in track 1.  for the subgroup of acos that entered track \n 2 or 3 in 2016 or 2017, the 1-2 years of downside risk exposure did not affect that pre- existing difference in benchmark savings rates, which remained similar in 2017 (3.5% for acos in tracks 2/3 vs. 1.3% for acos in track 1), suggesting that entry into a track with downside risk contributed no additional savings.  the mean benchmark savings rate in the 3 years prior to transitioning to track 1+ was similarly high (2.3%) among acos leaving track 1 for track 1+ in 2018.  the mean benchmark savings rate in 2017 among acos that entered track 2 or 3 directly, without a prior agreement period in track 1, was much lower\n(0.8%) than among acos selecting into downside risk tracks after experience in track 1.   \n\n in addition, we know from evaluations of the pioneer model25,26 that spending reductions in that 2-sided model were no greater than those achieved in 1-sided contracts in the mssp. similarly, the evidence shows that the two-sided next generation (next gen) model has performed no better than track 1 of the mssp when accounting for duration of participation in an aco program. specifically, the recent evaluation of year 1 of the next gen model by norc found gross annual savings of $210/beneficiary in 2016, but 15 of the\n 15\n 18 acos participating in next gen had significant prior experience in the pioneer model or mssp, including 2 of the 4 acos that drove the bulk of the savings.  these gross savings from next gen are no bigger than those achieved in the mssp when appropriately compared with mssp acos with multiple years of experience.  for example, in our recently published evaluation of the mssp, we found gross annual savings of $213/beneficiary in 2015 for acos entering in 2012 or 2013 (slightly greater than the next gen estimate).  thus, there is no evidence to date that downside risk has enhanced gross savings in medicare aco contracts, and thus no evidence that downside risk has elicited a stronger response from acos.\n without eliciting stronger efforts by acos to lower spending, downside risk does allow cms to recoup a portion of spending in excess of benchmarks.  for example, the 2016 net savings per beneficiary in next gen ($130/beneficiary in net savings to medicare) were greater than the 2015 net savings per beneficiary in the 2012-2013 entry cohorts of mssp acos ($62/beneficiary) despite the similar gross savings.  however, the net savings achieved by the 18 acos in next gen (most of which are large health systems) were smaller than the net savings generated by physician-group acos in the mssp ($180/beneficiary) and constituted much smaller aggregate net savings than produced by the more popular mssp ($62m from next gen\nvs. $190m from all 2012-2013 entrants in the mssp).  this underscores the importance of \n allowing physician groups (lower revenue organizations) to participate in one-sided contracts and suggests that downside risk could be used by cms to protect against losses from health systems, whose incentives in one-sided contracts are very weak. but we would note that any losses recouped by cms by requiring downside risk are likely to be at least partially, if not fully, offset by the increase in advanced apm bonus payments for providers accepting downside risk.  in addition, because the advanced apm bonus is structured as 5% of part b revenue, it acts to weaken incentives for acos to reduce provision of wasteful part b services (the size of the bonus is reduced when part b revenue is reduced).\n all else equal, we agree that introducing downside risk-sharing strengthens incentives for acos to lower spending.  but all else will not remain equal if downside risk is imposed, particularly because the mssp is voluntary and the proposed introduction of downside risk is coupled with regional blending of benchmarks.  since acos with spending above their regional average will disproportionately exit the program, most remaining acos will have spending below their regional average and thus benchmarks above their historical spending.  for those acos, downside risk adds little additional incentive to lower spending below the status quo because the incentive to lower spending when spending is below the benchmark stems from the upside risk sharing provisions. the cost of maintaining the status quo for those acos is the foregone profits from not earning more shared savings, not penalties from downside risk.  thus, because of the anticipated participation losses, imposing downside risk may not significantly strengthen incentives for remaining acos.\n 16\n losses, particularly when sustained repeatedly over multiple years.  because many acos will seek to mitigate their risk of losses, the extent to which downside risk incentives will reach the levels of organization currently exposed to one-sided incentives is unclear.  since health management firms take a cut of any shared savings, requiring downside risk will also weaken upside risk incentives for acos that partner with such firms.\n moreover, provider responses to mitigate downside risk will act to erode a key advantage of the aco model over the medicare advantage model \u00e2\u0080\u0093 lower administrative costs from direct contracting between medicare and providers.  as more acos pay premiums for reinsurance premiums and fees to management firms (which may take the form of a cut of shared savings), the administrative costs of the program will grow.\n finally, a stated motivation in the proposed rule for imposing downside risk is to discourage abuse of the program by provider organizations that participate to exploit waivers from stark and anti-kickback law and engage in anticompetitive behavior.  the proposed rule goes so far as to state, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfurther, the presence of an \u00e2\u0080\u0098upside-only\u00e2\u0080\u0099 track may be encouraging consolidation in the marketplace, reducing competition and choice for medicare ffs beneficiaries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  while this is certainly a valid concern, we are aware of no empirical evidence supporting this statement.  in fact, research to date has found little evidence of greater consolidation among aco participants as a result of the mssp.27 consolidation had been occurring before the mssp and has generally continued for other reasons.  while there may have been some defensive consolidation among non-aco providers27 (e.g. to rebuff payer attempts to engage them in aco risk contracts), that would not be addressed by changing risk-sharing provisions among mssp participants.  mssp participation has also not been associated with detectable changes in referrals, as measured by leakage.  specifically, mssp participation has not been associated with evidence of acos effectively steering outpatient specialty referrals internally to aco specialists.28  while this area remains one in need of further investigation, we do not believe it is appropriate to conclude that the mssp has contributed to consolidation or anticompetitive control over referrals.  given that the mssp model presents greater opportunities for physician groups (for the reasons described above) one could even argue that the mssp could contribute to greater competition in provider markets, as long as it continues to favor lower-revenue organizational structures in its incentives.\n moreover, use of downside risk to deter gaming or anticompetitive behavior implicitly assumes that the financial gains from abusing the program are smaller than the gains from genuinely engaging in efforts to lower spending.  however, the opposite is more like likely to be the case.  attempts to lower spending are fraught with uncertainty, challenges, and offsetting costs, and have not been strongly rewarded in the mssp because of rebasing and low shared savings rates, whereas engaging in anticompetitive behavior to enhance ffs profits is likely to be far more predictable and lucrative.  a health system could participate in the mssp to take advantage of waivers to maintain or increase referrals for inpatient and\n 17\n specialty care without affecting total medicare spending (i.e., only causing a shift in care that favors the health system). such behavior would increase provider revenue without resulting in penalties under downside risk. thus, requiring downside risk is likely to selectively discourage acos joining the program for the right reasons, while acos joining the program for the wrong reasons may not be dissuaded by downside risk as much because the gains from regulatory relief may outweigh any potential losses.  we would favor measures to identify abuses directly over blunt uses of downside risk requirements that risk having unintended consequences.\n in summary, there is no evidence that downside risk has elicited greater savings in medicare aco programs, and imposing downside risk in a voluntary program with regionally adjusted benchmarks is likely to induce cost-increasing participation losses and higher administrative costs, without achieving the goals of stronger incentives and selectively deterring abuse.\n recommendation 5: eliminate downside risk requirements for lower-revenue acos by retaining track 1, eliminating the basic track, and allowing voluntary participation in track\n1+.  replace the \u00e2\u0080\u009cclinician-led\u00e2\u0080\u009d basis for determining loss limits in track 1+ with the proposed \n revenue-based determination (aco revenue for medicare patients/total medicare spending for assigned population).\n recommendation 6: continue to require high-revenue acos to assume downside risk commensurate with the enhanced track but set the threshold for defining high revenue at a higher level corresponding to an integrated health system. also require downside risk of very large physician groups with market power. rather than rely solely on participant lists, use additional data on full organizational structure to determine organization-wide revenue for core practices responsible for attribution.\n we make the last part of recommendation 6 because we are concerned that acos, particularly high-revenue acos, may game revenue determinations if the aco participant lists are used to determine aco revenue, as proposed in the proposed rule.  for example, a large health system could include only its provider organizations or primary care practices in order to be judged as a low-revenue aco without significantly altering its attributed population.  for example, a large health system may own several hospitals and multiple physician groups, each billing under distinct tins.  or a health system may consist of a hospital system with a closely aligned provider organization billing under its own tin.  in such cases, which are common, the physician groups or provider organizations account for all or nearly all of the attribution but the hospitals and other facilities account for much of the revenue.  thus, an organization could include only its physician groups in its aco contract and lower its downside risk without changing its assigned population or its de facto governance (because of the common ownership or mutual interests shared by the health system and the physician groups).\n 18\n discourage a key strategy taken by acos\u00e2\u0080\u0094steering volume to more efficient providers and formalizing preferences with inclusion in contracts. we note that many acos with hospitals in participant lists are actually independent physician groups, and we categorized them as such in our evaluations.  these acos should be regarded as low-revenue to encourage their participation, but the proposed use of aco participant lists could categorize them as high- revenue, incentivizing them to drop such partnerships.  this could thwart healthy competition if such acos are able to get specialists and hospitals to compete on quality and efficiency for inclusion in aco contracts.\n therefore, we recommend using additional data sources, such as irs filings and pecos data, to determine the full organizational structure of the core practices that account for the bulk of the assigned population, and to use all tins and ccns in the full organization to determine organizational revenue.  we understand that pecos data are used to validate tins and ccns in aco participant lists, but these data can be additionally used by cms to determine the full organization to which aco participants belong.  in other work funded by the ahrq, we (a team of investigators at hms and the nber) have used these data sources to group independently billing tins and ccns into organizations or systems.  thus, although what we are suggesting would require some additional effort, we believe it would be feasible and would grow easier over time as such enhancements are made.  we would be happy to discuss with cms our experience in coalescing tins and ccns into organizations using these data sources.\n finally, we want to emphasize that we are recommending that revenue determinations be based ideally on the full organizational structure of the core practices that determine attribution.  if an aco includes physician groups that are part of a large health system, that aco should be considered high-revenue whether or not the other parts of the health system are included as participants.  if an aco includes physician groups that are financially independent of hospitals, that aco should be considered low-revenue (unless it is very specialty-heavy or has substantial market share), whether or not preferred hospital partners are included in the contracts.  that way, consolidation in provider markets is discouraged with more downside-risk in aco contracts, and partnerships or preferred networks that can support competition and do not cause commercial mark-ups are not discouraged.  the proposed use of only aco participant lists for revenue determinations could constitute a lost opportunity for discouraging price-increasing consolidation.\n strategies for addressing inadequate risk adjustment we agree with the proposed changes to account for increases in aco population risk scores and to implement measures to limit rewards for increases in coding intensity.  we do not, however, understand the rationale for limiting benchmark decreases to reflect decreases in risk scores.  capping downward adjustments for changes in patient risk introduces strong incentives for acos to engage in favorable risk selection (i.e., cream-skimming).\n 19\n resources available for quality improvement.  in particular, the aco cahps data, which include several measures of self-reported health and functional limitations, can be used to determine the extent to which increases in hcc scores reflect changes in coding vs. changes in health status.  discrepancies between the two could be used to limit benchmark increases due to coding increases in a more refined, aco-specific manner.  such adjustments could be instituted after an initial grace period (e.g., 3 years) that would permit coding increases that are unrelated to health status changes since they might reflect efforts by under-coding acos to achieve accurate coding. differences in spending predicted by hcc scores vs. cahps variables could also be used to identify acos that are undercoding relative to others at baseline and that should therefore be eligible for such a grace period.\n some of the clinical and social characteristics included in the cahps survey could also be used to further risk adjust aco benchmarks, and this information has been found to explain a meaningful amount of variation in aco spending after controlling for hcc score.29  we would caution, however, against adjustments for time-varying health status variables, as adjusting for health status weakens incentives for acos to improve patient health.\n an advantage of using acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 historical spending as the basis for benchmarks is that historical spending accounts for all differences in patient population risk between acos, whether measurable or not.  blending benchmarks with regional average makes program success depend heavily on risk adjustment for observable patient factors.  in the context of inadequate risk adjustment, regionally adjusted benchmarks would cause unjustified financial transfers from acos serving sicker and poorer patients to those serving healthier and wealthier patients.  unfortunately, risk adjustment will always be inadequate because all differences between patient populations can never be fully accounted for, particularly with available data sources.  it is not a question of whether risk adjustment is inadequate but the extent of its inadequacy.\n accordingly, in the future, should benchmarks be converged toward a regional average (again, we strongly recommend against regional adjustments at this juncture), we would urge cms to implement additional measures to ensure that acos are not penalized for serving higher-risk patients, independent of their efficiency or quality of care.  for example, an additional adjustment could take the form of a per-beneficiary care management fee that is higher for higher-risk patients, as in the comprehensive primary care plus program. to keep such a measure budget neutral and further encourage participation in the mssp, a small discount could be applied to ffs rates paid to all providers and redistributed as care management fees to acos, with higher payments to acos serving higher-risk patients regardless of their performance.  alternatively, aco benchmarks could simply be adjusted upward or downward by an additional amount (i.e., beyond adjustments for patient factors included in the risk-adjustment methodology) depending on whether their populations are higher- or lower-risk, respectively, than the regional average.\n finally, we are concerned that the proposed structure of the beneficiary incentive program could exacerbate favorable risk selection in the mssp.  specifically, because an aco must\n 20\n bear the costs of the incentive payments and because an aco must furnish an incentive payment to an eligible beneficiary each time the beneficiary receives a qualifying service (in accordance with section 1899(m)(2)(d)(iv) of the bipartisan budget act), the costs to an aco of serving higher-risk patients will be greater than the costs of serving lower-risk patients (since higher-risk patients use more services).  for this reason, we believe it is important for beneficiary incentive programs to be optional (as proposed), expect few acos to establish one, and do not expect the opportunity to establish one will attract acos into downside risk tracks.  we recommend close monitoring of acos that do implement beneficiary incentive programs.\n in general, we are in favor of patients sharing in the savings generated by their aco, whether in the form of direct payments, lower premiums, or in-kind benefits.  in the future, once more convergence in spending has occurred and benchmarks reliably reward more efficient providers, such mechanisms for sharing savings with beneficiaries could help to make more efficient providers more attractive to beneficiaries and foster competition to achieve savings (to compete for patients), as long as the benefits to beneficiaries are greater when aco savings are greater.  currently, linking the size of beneficiary payments to aco savings would tend to make the least efficient providers more attractive to beneficiaries since those providers are generating the most savings and would offer greater benefits. therefore, we agree with not establishing that link for now but believe it is worth revisiting once more convergence in spending occurs.  at that point, mechanisms to share savings with beneficiaries also could be used to mitigate incentives for acos to select low-risk patients by stipulating that higher-risk patients receive more of the savings than lower-risk patients.  acos engaging in favorable risk selection to generate savings would then become more attractive to the patients they may be trying to avoid.  we understand that the bipartisan budget act currently prohibits unequal payments to different beneficiaries.  we are suggesting this potential policy direction for future consideration.\n recommendation 7: eliminate cap on downward benchmark adjustments that result from decreases in risk scores to mitigate what would otherwise be strong incentives to engage in favorable risk selection. use aco cahps data to help distinguish between changes in coding intensity and changes in population health status.  should benchmarks be converged to a regional average in the future (not in the near term per recommendation 4), implement additional payments or benchmark adjustments so that acos are not penalized for serving higher-risk patients.\n 21\n for regional trend assessment. but small sample sizes can be handled easily with hierarchical statistical modeling approaches. the second is that aco populations may differ markedly from non-aco populations and thus have distinct expected spending trends.  but research to date has found that aco and non-aco populations are largely similar, on average.  moreover, this concerned is best addressed with rigorous risk adjustment of benchmark updates for an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population risk, as risk adjustment will not diminish incentives to save.  the third is that removing an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population will strengthen incentives for acos to select patients with favorable risks.  we believe this, too, is most appropriately addressed with risk adjustment.  no matter the updating methodology, acos will have incentives to select patients that are lower-risk in ways that are not accounted for by the risk adjustment methodology.  as we discuss above, we believe the risk adjustment methodology can be improved and additional steps can be taken to minimize incentives for favorable risk selection.\n therefore, we recommend removing an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed population from update determinations.  we generally agree with the proposed blending of concurrent national and regional growth rates to update benchmarks, with greater weight given to national growth rates for acos in areas where the ffs population served by other providers is limited.  but rather than use an arbitrary weighting scheme, we recommend the use of standard statistical approaches to estimation that account for random error from finite sample sizes. such methods are used, for example, to estimate excess readmission rates for the hospital readmissions reduction program.  specifically, at the end of each performance year, cms analysts could use claims data from the performance year and baseline year 3 (by3) to fit a simple multilevel model of total medicare spending per beneficiary as a function of county- level random intercepts and (time) slopes, excluding beneficiaries attributed to the aco of interest (the model would be estimated separately to determine each aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s update).  with empirical bayes estimation, the model will produce estimates of county-level spending trends that are shrunken toward the national trend when a county\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sample is small (whether because the county is small or because a large proportion of its population is served by the aco) and closer to the unshrunken county trend when the population in the county not assigned to the aco is large. for each aco, a weighted average of the estimated (shrunken) county trends can then be taken (reflecting the geographic distribution of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed patients) to arrive at the benchmark update for that aco.\n this approach would preserve incentives for acos to lower spending by removing their assigned population from update determinations while incorporating regional trends to the extent they can be reliably estimated and flexibly giving more weight to the national trend for acos that serve higher proportions of their service area.  we believe it is important initially to incorporate regional trend information to the extent possible because it is important initially to align benchmarks with acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 counterfactual spending to engender trust that acos will be rewarded for improvement.  after acos have had a few years to lower spending, benchmarks may later diverge from counterfactual spending without reactionary participation losses, as long as the divergence does not depend on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past performance, as discussed above.  this method achieves the goal of incorporating regional trends to the extent it can be reliably supported by the data.\n 22\n by including the rest of the aco population in update determinations (all but those assigned to the aco of interest), this approach to benchmark updating will still apply downward pressure on aco benchmarks at a rate that follows, but is less than, the rate of slowing in spending caused by the program.  thus, rebasing is not necessary to exert this downward pressure.  including the rest of the aco population in update determination will also introduce an element of competition in markets with multiple acos, as acos will be rewarded more if they lower spending more than their competitors.  this dynamic may become undesirably prominent in large service areas dominated by multiple acos.  in such markets, the weight given to the national trend will be limited because the market is large (allowing stable trend estimation), so that the update for an aco will be based almost entirely on the performance of its neighboring aco competitors.  thus, if all acos lower spending significantly and equally, none would be rewarded for doing so.  such cases are not currently common.  a more common scenario is the single aco dominating a small market.  for those cases, our recommended methodology would rely on national trends for updates.  but cms could monitor for cases of high aco penetration in large markets with multiple acos and use national trends for those markets, too.\n more generally, should the mssp expand to the point that the national non-aco population becomes small, we would recommend choosing a desirable rate at which benchmarks should grow and apply that rate to all acos.  the methodology we describe above is best suited to an expansion phase of the program.\n recommendation 8: remove an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed population from benchmark update determinations to preserve incentives for acos to lower spending. use multilevel statistical modeling approaches to estimate aco-specific update factors that reflect regional and national trends, with greater weight placed on national trends for aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that serve higher proportions of patients in their service area.  after a phase of program expansion, switch to using a desirable preset rate of benchmark growth applied to all acos.\n thank you for your consideration of our comments.  if you should wish to discuss any of our analyses or recommendations further, you can reach us

its august 9 proposed rule on the medicare shared savings aco program.\n\n | currently lead a track 1+ mssp aco, called north central arizona accountable care, llc, which started in january 2015. we are located in central arizona and have approximately 14,500 medicare beneficiaries.\n\n as you are aware, on august 9, 2018, cms released a proposed rule that would set a new direction for the mssp, referred to as the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3pathways to success\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 program. the proposal would improve the existing mssp in a number of ways, including:\n\n e lengthens agreement periods from three years to five years, promoting program stability; e ramps up risk more gradually for \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3basic\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 track acos;\n e provides an additional six to 18 months in a shared savings only model for 82 current acos that would otherwise be required to move to risk on january 1, 2019, if renewing participation;\n e makes basic level e (track 1+ equivalent) permanent; \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e3\u00b3 includes implementation of aco-specific payment rule waivers and beneficiary incentives;\n e provides flexibility to acos by allowing them to choose assignment annually regardless of risk-based status;\n e replaces the certified electronic health record technology (cehrt) use measure with attestation; and\n e adding waivers to the program.\n\n | agree that these are all significant improvements to the aco program. we do, however, have some significant concerns with the proposed rule, as | will identify below.\n\n areas of concern\n e shortening the time that acos have to take on downside financial risk, which will deter new entrants and drive existing acos to leave the program. the proposed rule reduces the onramp to taking on downside financial risk for new acos from six to only two years. based on a naacos survey conducted earlier this year, this will likely result in more than 70 percent of early acos leaving the program. further, research, including the hhs inspector general\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s, shows that it typically takes more than two years for acos to make the clinical and operational changes to prepare successfully for financial risk.\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e3\u00b3 cutting shared savings from 50 to 25 percent, which will deter new entrants. the proposed rule cuts shared savings in half for shared savings-only acos, severely undermining the business case to join the pathways to success program and begin the transition to value-based payment for new acos. acos are investing millions of dollars of their own capital to improve care; cms\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s proposed reduction of the shared savings rate will preclude acos from generating a return on investment. closing off the pipeline of new acos will significantly hamper the overall shift to value-based payment.\n\n \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e3\u00b3 changing the regional benchmarking may deter new entrants and drive existing acos to leave the program. regions that have lower benchmarks (and typically lower costs/spend) are unfairly offset by the regions whereby benchmarks and cost/spend is much, much higher. this makes it extremely difficult for aco in regions with lower benchmarking to compete when the standard or baseline is significantly higher. in other words, in regions where spend and benchmarks are low, there is less opportunity to reduce costs and increase savings for cms. what would be the incentive for acos to participate in ssp in low-cost, low-spend regions? (for example, how does an acos with an $8000 benchmark complete [for shared savings] with an aco with a $25,000 benchmark?) there is significant investment in aco start-up and operations, so there would be little, if anything, to offset the costs of starting and/or maintaining an aco.\n\n e lack of transparency in benchmarking may deter new entrants and drive existing acos to leave the program. while the proposed rule states that the benchmarking would be overhauled to depict a more accurate representation of the aco\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s costs (regional or national service areas) there is little transparency in the methodology. transparency of the current methodology would allow acos to perform enhanced analytics and better forecast future savings/costs.\n\n e existing benchmarking adjustments/readjustments may deter new entrants and drive existing acos to leave the program. the current benchmarking adjustments do not keep current with the changes in acuity and health status of patients. the annual update to historical benchmark does not take into consideration disease progression and/or unforeseen circumstances or changes in health status and/or acuity. an increase in adjustment frequency would assist acos in being more successful.\n\n e include and recognize of all chronic conditions within cms-hcc risk adjustment model so all costs of chronic conditions are factored into cost and utilization of services. for example, cms-hcc does not\n risk adjust for chronic ischemic heart disease (without angina pectoris); yet, chronic ischemic vascular disease of the brain (i.e. cerebrovascular disease) and extremities (i.e. peripheral vascular disease) are recognized and risk adjusted as chronic conditions. ischemic heart (or coronary artery) disease remains the leading cause of death in the united states, but is not accounted for in risk scoring without accompanying angina. individuals with heart disease (with or without angina) have to be chronically managed and need the resources to do so...\n\n given the significant negative impact presented by the areas of concern above, naacos strongly urges cms to modify the above two provisions to: 1) increase the permitted time in basic levels a and b to at least three years and for acos that meet certain quality and cost standards allow additional years; 2) rescind the proposed decrease in shared savings and retain the existing 50 percent shared savings rate for shared savings only and low risk acos; 3) do not make changes to the regional benchmarking; 4) increase transparency in benchmarking; 5) increase frequency of benchmarking\n t t/readjust t; and 6) include/recognize all chronic conditions in the cms-hcc risk\n adjustment model.\n thank you for your time and consideration to our comments.\n\n sincerely,\n ami giardina\n\n", "0016": "why pathways to success should support the value of assessments and integrated behavioral health services in primary care, including the use in acos\r\n\r\nin the absence of effective behavioral health assessment tools, the vast majority of people with mental health conditions go unidentified in primary care settings. that lack of identification and treatment in most cases leads to higher total medical costs and non-adherent patients.\r\n\r\nadditionally, failure to diagnose and effectively manage/treat patients in many cases results in increased risk of suicidality and addiction.\r\n\r\nthe use of validated assessment tools and integrated care can make acos far more clinically effective and financially sound.\r\n\r\nbehavior health is central to the development, prevention, treatment, and management of the preventable manifestations of diseases and health conditions (heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, unintentional injuries, pneumonia and influenza, diabetes, suicide, kidney diseases, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, hiv/aids) on which the u.s. spends about $1.5 trillion, 75% of our annual healthcare costs. 1\r\n\r\nthe connection between behavior and physical health is clear. it includes both behavioral risk factors (like smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity), behavioral interventions like stress management, behavioral sleep management, behavioral pain management, and psychological interventions addressing quality of life. people with common physical health conditions (diabetes, cardiac, obesity, etc.) have higher rates of mental health issues, with unipolar depression being the 2nd largest contributor to disease burden in countries like the u.s. more than heart disease, alcohol use, and traffic accidents. primary care settings provide about half of all mental health care for common psychiatric disorders. unfortunately, medical providers often lack the time or training to help patients manage behavioral health problems in evidence-based ways beside offering prescriptions for medication.\r\n\r\nwhat is integrated behavioral health care?\r\n\r\nbroadly, integrated behavioral health care can be described as any situation in which behavioral health and medical providers work collaboratively. also termed; integrated health, co-coordinated care, seamless care, comprehensive care, or integrated primary care, this approach comes in a number of models, varying in level of integration and dependent upon the resources of the health care practice or system.\r\n\r\nwhen behavioral health practitioners, such as health psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, clinical social workers, or health coaches are integrated into the medical setting, whether in-person or virtually, they are able to assess the global health of the patient and work cooperatively with the medical provider; truly providing patient-centered and comprehensive health care. according to cj peek and the national integration academy councils lexicon for behavioral health and primary care (2013),\r\nintegrated primary care is the care that results from a practice team of primary care and behavioral health clinicians, working together with patients and families, using a systematic and cost-effective approach to provide patient-centered care for a defined population. this care may address mental health and substance abuse conditions, health behaviors (including their contribution to chronic medical illnesses), life stressors and crises, stress-related physical symptoms, and ineffective patterns of health care utilization.\r\nultimately, early assessment and treatment of behavioral health issues leads to better outcomes for both mental and physical health while decreasing total cost of care.\r\n\r\n1.agency for healthcare research and quality:

\u00e2\u0080\u009cpathways to success\u00e2\u0080\u009d mssp proposed rule\ndear administrator verma,\naugusta care partners is an accountable care organization (aco) based in rural virginia that represents a strong partnership between independent physician practices and a community hospital with employed providers. we are currently in our second agreement period as a track 1 aco in the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\nit is important to note that while our aco has not yet achieved shared savings, we have maintained quality scores in the top quartile of all mssp acos and, at the same time, have sustained one of the lowest cost-per-beneficiary rates across all mssp acos.  these results can be directly tied to significant investments in improving coordination of care and our team of providers being committed to generating positive outcomes for medicare beneficiaries in our community.  as a participating augusta care partners provider, i feel it is important to voice my opinion on a few key points in the mssp proposed rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success.\nproviding an opportunity to choose prospective attribution in both the basic and enhanced tracks is a significant improvement. our aco has been challenged by the uncertainty of preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment with retrospective reconciliation. having the option to definitively know our attributed patient panel at the beginning of the year offers some much-needed stability and helps guide the appropriate allocation of our aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finite resources.\nthe flexibility offered by the snf waiver is a huge benefit. i appreciate that cms is expanding access to this important program feature.\ni am hopeful that the 5 year agreement periods offered in both the basic and enhanced tracks will create increased predictability in the program. it is also a welcome change to have risk scores updated annually for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total population, instead of differentiating between \u00e2\u0080\u009cnewly assigned\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinuously assigned\u00e2\u0080\u009d beneficiaries. i am concerned, however, that limiting the risk adjustment to +/- 3% over that 5 year agreement period will not protect providers who serve our most medically complicated patients. medicare beneficiaries can experience significant changes in health status over 5 years, and those changes may not be adequately addressed by the proposed methodology. our aco has been challenged by a benchmark that does not reflect the health of our population. we have worked hard to understand the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complex benchmarking rules and to raise awareness about the importance of coding specificity to care coordination. i am concerned that, despite our demonstrated track record of low cost and high quality,  the +/- 3% cap will disadvantage our aco by continuing to incorrectly capture the health status of our beneficiaries, making shared savings unattainable.\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret that the abstraction of quality metrics is an onerous process, and i am encouraged by the current administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to reduce reporting burden for providers. i am also a strong advocate for transparency in scoring. should cms choose to increase the number of claims-based measures, it would be extremely helpful to provide user-friendly, actionable reports that detail the aco-specific data used to calculate specific measure performance.\ni am concerned about how the enhanced notification requirements will impact my office workflow and efficiency. it will be challenging to add one more piece of paper to the stack of important documents my patients are asked to review and acknowledge at each visit. also, while i appreciate the option of providing beneficiary incentives, the administrative burden of implementation and tracking would likely create additional frustration for staff and add expense to my office\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations.\nthank you for taking my comments into consideration as you work to streamline the mssp model. i look forward to seeing continued improvements in the coming years that will benefit my patients and allow me and my fellow aco participants to focus on providing

countless hours and approximately $2 million to get to this point.\r\n-cms approved our three-year track 1 agreement in may and our 80+ independent practices have signed the agreements. and just when we are moving forward into our second performance period, the proposed rule would invalidate all of our agreements and force us to stop our work and determine if we will have the money to move forward under a two-sided model.\r\n-a small group of rural providers took a leap of faith by investing in this aco for the first three-year agreement and have assumed responsibility for a line of credit

early spring of 2016, nine independent critical access hospitals, located in nebraska and northern kansas, started looking at what it would take to apply to participate in cms medicare shared savings program aco.  these facilities had very little experience in valued-based medicine or population health management. it was impossible for any of these facilities to apply on their own, as they would not be able to meet the required 5000 attributed beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needed to be approved by\ncms.  working together in this collaborative allowed the hospitals, clinics and providers to start \n working together to develop the infrastructure and processes to develop a successful collaborative\naco. \n\n the application process was completed in the fall of 2016 and we were approved effective january 1, 2017 for our 3-year agreement in a track 1 mssp.  we had 9 critical access hospitals/rural health clinics/providers with over 9,000 attributed medicare beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in our first year.  in 2018 we added 5 more critical access hospitals and now have just under 16,000 attributed medicare beneficiaries.  since the aco investment model (aim) funding was not available to us when we started, the costs of infrastructure and support is being supported by the critical access hospitals who have already narrow margins to support this development.\n the plan when starting this journey was that it would take us up to 6 years as a track 1 mssp aco to be able to complete the development of infrastructure, processes and the comfort level to move to a risk model aco.  the proposed changes in the pathways to success proposed rules shortens that to 4 years and will make it very difficult to complete the development needed to prepare rural critical access hospitals to move to a risk track.  it was also our plan to continue to add other critical access hospitals to our collaborative once we gained traction and developed expertise.  with the proposed rule changes limiting risk tracks to one or two years will make it very difficult to attract other critical access hospitals to join the collaborative.   at this time very few critical access hospitals in our state participate in an mssp and we believe, given the proper amount of time, others would join into this effort.  we recently received our first year results and although we did not achieve shared savings, we are within the 3% corridor of our first year benchmark.\n please allow the time needed to organize these efforts and to encourage other critical access hospitals and providers to join into the program.\n sincerely,\n\n\n rodney g. triplett npg health collaborative\n\n\n\n", "0318": "see attached file(s) 1 | p a g e\n\n\n october 16, 2018\n\n

offer effective solutions for the most chronically-ill and medically complex patients \u00e2\u0080\u0093 those 10 percent of patients that consume 60 percent of medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s costs. additionally, we are committed to delivering innovative solutions through expanded care management capabilities across an integrated post-acute care (pac) network, data-driven insights, and 24/7 direct consumer assistance and support.  this includes kindred healthcare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation in accountable care organizations, bundled payments, and value-based purchasing programs.\n studies  demonstrate  that inpatient  rehabilitation  facilities  (irfs)  and  long-term  care  hospitals (ltchs) create optimal outcomes for the most difficult to treat patients, and thus, kindred healthcare believes  that  they play  an  essential  role  in  a  successful  medicare  shared saving  program  (mssp) accountable  care  organizations (acos).   kindred  healthcare is  the  leading  provider  of  specialized healthcare  to  clinically  complex  patients  in  nearly  2,500  hospitals  and  post-acute  care  facilities  in  45 states.  we  are  the  premier  provider  of  rehabilitation  and  critically  complex  care, delivered  in our 75 long-term care hospitals, 19 free-standing inpatient rehabilitation facilities, 99 hospital-based acute rehabilitation units, and through contract rehabilitation services in nearly 1,700 unaffiliated post-acute locations.\n kindred  encourages the  centers for  medicare  and  medicaid  services  (cms)  to  consider  additional pricing and regulatory flexibility for irfs and ltchs to allow them to effectively participate in alternate payment models.  below are more details regarding the additional waivers cms could grant which would furnish these providers with the necessary flexibility to respond to innovative payment designs and could present a stepping stone toward achieving a unified post-acute care payment system.\n\nii. expand payment flexibility \n cms has encouraged post-acute care providers to participate in alternative payment models (apms) such as  acos.  however,  medicare  reimbursement  for inpatient rehabilitation facilities and  long-term  care hospital  services  is  very  rigid,  with  a  fixed  per-patient  discharge  prospective  payment  system  based largely on factors outside of the hospital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control. in contrast, other pac providers have a greater degree of control over their medicare costs, namely through reducing their \u00e2\u0080\u009cunits\u00e2\u0080\u009d of utilization in either a per diem  payment  system  (nursing  homes)  or  a  fixed-length  episodic  payment  system  (home  health). although irfs and ltchs are encouraged to collaborate with acos on delivering efficient medicare spending, they are not given sufficient flexibility to adjust the costs associated with the resources used. to  facilitate  innovation  of  care delivery,  cms  should  grant acos  and  bundle  holders  more flexibility to negotiate market-based payment arrangements with irfs and ltchs so that patients that are treated under alternative payment models have continued access to quality care in settings that their treating physicians require.  otherwise, what should be clinical decisions will be made for purely  financial  reasons  because  under  the  current  system  acos  and  bundle-holders  are constrained by an inelastic medicare fee structure that effectively prices them out of apms.\n 3 | p a g e\n cases. in addition, flexibility would be provided to further reduce spending by lowering lengths of stay (los) by incorporating a per-diem payment method for shorted than average stay patients.\niii. expand regulatory waivers   \n in addition to pricing flexibility, cms clearly retains the regulatory authority to waive some or all of the restrictive  requirements  in  the  context  of  these  models,  and  have  made  similar  concessions  for  other providers. although cms waived the significant and well-established snf three-day stay rule, the agency should go further and also waive certain regulatory requirements that must be relaxed to facilitate patient access to irf and ltchs under the mssp.\n accordingly, various regulatory requirements should be waived in the context of specific apms to allow irfs and ltchs to more effectively participate. currently, existing conditions of participation restrict fair competition across pac providers. one example is the three hour therapy rule for irfs. according to the three hour therapy rule, medicare requires that at the time of admission, the patient must receive and benefit from  three  hours  of  therapy  per day  for  at  least five  days  per  week.    if  patients  are  unable  to tolerate three hours of therapy for five days each week, they would not qualify for irf payments. another example is that irfs and ltchs are required to have higher staffing ratios with more frequent patient contact by physicians than other pac settings. in addition, irfs and ltchs must meet stringent federal hospital  conditions  of  participation,  among  other  strict  federal  and  state  hospital  licensing  and  other regulatory requirements.\n cms also restricts the proportion of patients with certain clinical conditions (i.e., the irf \u00e2\u0080\u009c60% rule\u00e2\u0080\u009d) or level of clinical severity as measured by average hospital length of stay (i.e., the ltch 25 day average length of stay rule).  waiving these regulatory restrictions will furnish acos and bundle-holders with additional flexibility to treat patients in the most clinically appropriate and cost-effective setting for the appropriate length of time.  with the appropriate reporting requirements and financial incentives in place to ensure high quality clinically appropriate care, these regulatory restrictions are unnecessary and impede the  ability of providers to fully innovate  or reform health delivery systems.   if left unaddressed,  these regulatory differences have the potential to negatively impact patient referral patterns and patient access to clinically appropriate care in certain types of settings as well as restrict fair competition across pac providers.\n these approaches are consistent with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recent emphasis on expanding provider access to apms, and has been favorably discussed by medpac in the context of reforming and advancing medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post- acute  care  payment  systems.  cms  has  the  authority  to  permit  such  flexibility,  and  to  waive  these bureaucratic requirements without congressional approval; the agency should do so when promulgating any future models or changes to the current programs.\n\niv. conclusion \n\n 4 | p a g e\n congressional approval; the agency should do so when promulgating any future models or changes to the current programs to enable providers to effectively participate in these programs.\n\n\n", "0344": "see attached file(s) population health niyum gandhi evp & chief population health officer

organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways  to  success, as  published  in  the  august  17,  2018 federal register.\n the  mount  sinai  health  system  is  an  integrated  health  system  in  new  york committed to providing distinguished care, conducting transformative research, and advancing biomedical education. structured around seven member hospital campuses and a single medical school, the health system has an extensive ambulatory network and a range of inpatient and outpatient services\u00e2\u0080\u0094from community-based facilities to tertiary and quaternary care. mount

savings program (mssp) as  a  key  part  of  efforts  to  expand  value-based  care.  our  recommendations  below reflect our desire to see the mssp achieve the long-term sustainability necessary to enhance care coordination for millions of medicare beneficiaries, lower the growth rate  of  healthcare  spending  and  improve  quality  in  the  medicare  program.  we appreciate the opportunity to share our comments on this proposed regulation.\n\n\n population health niyum gandhi evp & chief population health officer mount sinai one gustave l. levy place, box 1475 new york, ny 10029-6574 t

the  creation  of  a  new  basic  track  with  a  gradual  glide  path  to performance-based  risk.  however,  we  oppose the  significant  reductions  in  shared savings rates from the current track 1 shared savings rate of 50 percent to as low as 25  percent  under  the  proposed  basic  track  levels  a  and  b.  this  substantial reduction in shared savings rates would weaken the business case for new acos to form and for existing acos that require some additional experience before moving to downside  risk  to  continue  in  the  program.  we  recommend  that  cms  finalize  a savings rate of 50 percent for basic levels a and b, 55 percent for basic levels c and d, and 60 percent for basic level e.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 section  ii.a.5  determining  participation  options  based  on  medicare ffs revenue and prior participation\n options for renewing and re-entering track 1 acos\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow acos with no experience in performance-based risk  models  to  enter  a  new  agreement  period  in  basic  level  b.  we  believe  this gives acos with experience in the program but without experience in downside risk a reasonable amount of time in the new program structure before being required to move to downside risk. we strongly advocate for this proposal to be finalized rather than the more aggressive approach cms considered in which acos with experience in track 1 would be required to start at basic level c or higher.\n additionally,  we  support  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099  proposal  to  allow  acos  with  agreement  periods ending december 31, 2018 to extend that agreement through june 30, 2019.\n options for new acos\n we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to encourage providers to move to risk by introducing a structure  that  includes  a  more  gradual  glide  path  for  assuming  risk  through  the basic track. however, we have significant concerns that reducing the amount of time  available  in  shared  savings-only  models  would  discourage  new  acos  from forming and joining the  program, and  may encourage  acos  that would ultimately have been successful in the program to leave early. acos participating in the mssp over  a  longer  period  of  time  show  greater  improvement  in  financial  performance, demonstrating the value of such models and the need to allow acos sufficient time to demonstrate positive results.\n population health niyum gandhi evp & chief population health officer mount sinai one gustave l. levy place, box 1475 new york, ny 10029-6574 t 814-360-1120 f 212-410-6111 niyum.gandhi@mountsinai.org\nwww.mountsinai.org \n\n\n we recommend that cms allow new acos at least four years in shared savings-only arrangements to provide the acos with two to three years of performance data, the minimum  that  would  be  necessary  to  identify  trends  and  opportunities  for transformation and improvement before they have to decide whether to move to an arrangement  with  downside  risk.  for  example,  cms  could  implement  a  policy allowing all new acos to remain in basic level a for two years and basic level b for an additional two years before requiring the aco to move to level c in the fifth and final year of their agreement. alternatively, cms could allow new acos to remain in a shared savings-only track for the full five years of their first agreement period. these acos should then be permitted to begin their second agreement period at basic level c or d where they would participate for three years and progress to level e for the final two years of their second agreement period. we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow acos to progress more quickly to greater levels of risk if the aco chooses.\n differentiating between low revenue acos and high revenue acos\n while we appreciate the removal of the self-reporting requirements under the track 1+ model, we question the need to further divide acos into arbitrary categories of high and low revenue acos and to apply different schedules for how and when they must progress  along  the  risk  continuum.  we  oppose  categorizing  acos  in  this manner and the other options that cms considered (hospital vs. physician only, small\nvs. large) and urge cms to not finalize the high and low revenue distinctions. \n\n the  proposed  high  and  low  revenue  distinctions  create  unnecessary  program complexity, which cms has taken great strides to try to reduce across a variety of medicare programs in recent months. furthermore, the move creates uncertainty for acos  who may have  a  difficult time  predicting the category in which they would fall. this distinction would also change over time as aco participant composition changes, adding more complexity and making long-term planning very difficult.\n rather  than  finalize  unnecessary  and  arbitrary distinctions  for  acos,  cms  should work to support all acos as they progress on the value-based care continuum, and the agency should create meaningful incentives for acos to assume risk. the goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients, and cms should  adopt  policies  that  continue  to  engage  hospitals  as  key  players  rather  than create  incentives  to  exclude  hospitals  as  aco  participants.  the  best  way  to  drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate to innovate and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare.\n population health niyum

\n\n\n if cms does finalize a proposal to distinguish between acos, we recommend using a policy that allows acos to easily understand their options for participation ahead of time.\n related  to  this  proposal,  we  recommend  that  cms  not  require  any  acos  with experience in downside risk to move to the enhanced track. along with removing the  distinction between low and  high revenue acos, we  encourage  cms  to allow acos with experience in downside risk to enter basic level e or the enhanced track. the proposed policy to require certain acos to enter the enhanced track could be especially problematic for acos that moved to the track 1+ model mid- agreement period and would now, if considered to be high revenue, be required to make  a  significant  jump  from  the  track  1+  level  of  downside  risk  to  the enhanced level of risk with only minimal experience in performance-based risk.\n monitoring for financial performance\n we  are  concerned  about  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal  to  implement  financial  performance monitoring  in  the  manner  proposed  (i.e.,  that  cms  may  terminate  an  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation  agreement  if  the  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  expenditures  for  the  assigned  beneficiary population  exceed  the  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  updated  benchmark  by  an  amount  equal  to  or exceeding either the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative msr under a one-sided model, or the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mlr under a two-sided model after two performance years.) we believe this policy will have the unintended consequence of removing well intentioned acos from the program  who  might  otherwise  go  on  to  achieve  savings  and  make  quality improvements for their patients.\n population health niyum gandhi evp & chief population health officer mount sinai one gustave l. levy place, box 1475 new york, ny 10029-6574 t 814-360-1120 f 212-410-6111 niyum.gandhi@mountsinai.org\nwww.mountsinai.org \n\n\n\n further, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside the corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d sets a very low bar, especially for acos in downside financial risk models where the aco can select an mlr as low as 0 percent.\n should  the  agency  move  forward  with  this  type  of  early  termination  policy,  at  a minimum  it  should  be  used  only  in  rare  cases  where  the  agency  specifically  has documented program integrity concerns, and the corridor used to identify excessive spending should be higher than the one proposed.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 section  ii.d.2  risk  adjustment  methodology  for  adjusting  historical benchmark each performance year\n we  support  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099  proposal  to  revise  the  current  policy  that  treats  beneficiaries differently  depending  on  whether  they  are  considered  newly  or  continuously assigned. we also support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow risk scores to increase between benchmark year 3 and the performance year. instead of applying a threshold of +/- 3 percent, we recommend that cms finalize a cap of +/- 5 percent. we believe a larger cap is more appropriate given the potential for greater changes in acuity over a five year agreement period.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 section ii.d.3 use of regional factors when establishing and resetting acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benchmarks\n we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to introduce a regional expenditure component into  the  initial  agreement  period,  rather  than  waiting  until  at  least  the  second agreement  period.  this  is  especially  important  with  longer,  five-year  agreement periods.  we  also support  cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued  application  of  one  of  two  regional expenditure components  based  on how the  acos  spending compares to that of its region, and the proposed 25 percent and 35 percent thresholds are appropriate.  we recommend cms finalize these policies as proposed.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 section ii.c.3 providing tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n beneficiary notifications\n population health niyum gandhi evp & chief population health officer mount sinai one gustave l. levy place, box 1475 new york, ny 10029-6574 t 814-360-1120 f 212-410-6111 niyum.gandhi@mountsinai.org\nwww.mountsinai.org \n\n\n notification  requirement  was  too burdensome.  we  are  concerned  that  requiring additional  notifications  will  take  time  away  from  other  important  conversations between providers and their patients and create confusion for beneficiaries who may worry  that  there  will  be  some  impact  to  their  freedom  of  choice  or  out  of  pocket costs.  we  recommend  that  cms  not  finalize  the  proposed  policies  and  instead maintain current beneficiary notification requirements.\n beneficiary opt-in based assignment methodology\n cms is seeking comment on possible future changes to the program that would rely on an opt-in process rather than claims-based attribution. we do not support moving in  this  direction  under  the  mssp.  altering  the  attribution  process  to  require beneficiaries  to  actively  elect  an  aco  would  create  substantial  administrative complexities that would likely be insurmountable for less well-resourced acos, and would be confusing to beneficiaries. as cms notes, this process would be similar to enrolling in an ma plan. for beneficiaries who have been in medicare ffs for many years and have not selected an ma plan, we do not believe they would be likely to enroll in an aco. beneficiaries would not have a clear financial incentive to enroll in an  aco  since  doing  so  would  have  no  effect  on  their  premium  or  cost-sharing arrangements.  additionally ffs  beneficiaries  often  place  a  high  value  on  their freedom of choice and may be concerned that enrollment would restrict their access to  a  particular  network.  we  believe  it  would  be  very  difficult  for  an  aco  to successfully enroll  a  sufficient  number  of  beneficiaries  to  meet  minimum requirements for an actuarially stable benchmark to be set.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 section ii.a.4.c proposals for permitting annual election of beneficiary assignment methodology\n we strongly support the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to provide acos with more flexibility in selecting a prospective or retrospective assignment methodology on an annual basis, and we urge cms to finalize this proposal.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 section ii.b fee-for-service

encourage participation in tracks with more risk, we believe the new structure of the program involves sufficient requirements to move acos along that path, and that the availability of these waivers earlier on would enable acos to be more effective in managing utilization and providing high quality, person-centered care sooner.\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 inclusion of mips adjustments in aco expenditure calculations\n we  urge  cms  to  exclude  mips  bonuses  as  aco  expenditures  under  the  mssp shared  savings  and  losses  methodology.  when  aco-attributed  patients  receive services  from providers  that  have  earned  positive  mips  adjustments,  it harms  the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to generate savings. this will be increasingly important over time as mips bonuses are projected to rise in future program years. the current cms policy creates misalignment between the goals of mips and the mssp. the better an aco and its eligible clinicians perform in mips, the greater the penalty when calculating shared  savings/losses  for  the  aco.  we  strongly  encourage  cms  to  amend  the current methodology to exclude these payment adjustments.\n thank  you  for

similarity between the opt-in option and the voluntary alignment option \n may cause confusion among beneficiaries. if cms does move forward with an opt-in option, we would recommend aligning it with the voluntary alignment option so that if a patient \u00e2\u0080\u009copts-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d to an aco the next step would be selecting a primary clinician in the aco. this would then trigger the voluntary alignment beneficiary assignment methodology, allowing patients to select their provider of choice without requiring an unnecessary primary care visit from a primary care or specialty

with the language in the bipartisan budget act of 2018, this would supersede any claims-based assignment methodology. this is an important step to increase the number of clinicians and beneficiaries participating in the mssp and reduce the utilization of unnecessary primary care visits conducted solely for beneficiary assignment. patients should have the authority to select their health care

honorable seema verma administrator centers for medicare & medicaid services department of health and human services 200 independence avenue, sw washington, dc 20201\n re: cms-1701-p; medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success proposed rule\n dear administrator verma:\n the medical group management association (mgma) is pleased to offer the following comments to the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) regarding the medicare shared savings program (mssp) pathways to success proposed rule. mgma is the premier association for professionals who lead medical practice. since 1926, through data, people, insights, and advocacy, mgma empowers medical group practices to innovate and create meaningful change in healthcare. with a membership of more than 40,000 medical practice administrators, executives, and leaders, mgma represents more than 12,500 organizations of all sizes, types, structures and specialties that deliver almost half of the healthcare in the united states. mgma appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts in the proposed rule to increase stability, predictability, and regulatory burden relief for accountable care organizations (acos) participating in the mssp. however, we have significant concerns regarding some of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposals and recommend the agency revisit proposed policies that would compromise sustained and robust participation in the mssp. we urge cms to: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increase stability and predictability in the program by finalizing the proposal to lengthen agreement periods to five years. constant change in payment policies across medicare programs is disruptive and burdensome; cms should capitalize on efforts to introduce program stability where it\ncan. \n 1717 pennsylvania ave. nw, #600 washington, dc 20006 t 202.293.3450 f 202.293.2787 mgma.org administrator verma\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 2\n\n 1717 pennsylvania ave.

health are what drives changes in provider behavior. these changes can take years to produce results, as demonstrated by the increasingly positive results for acos that are in the program for a longer period of time. as policy experts in health affairs suggest, there is a \u00e2\u0080\u009clearning curve\u00e2\u0080\u009d that extends more than two years and that acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cshared savings rate doubled with three years of experience, from about 21% for those acos in their first mssp performance year to over 41-43% for those acos in their fourth and fifth performance years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d1 research to date suggests that acos improve with experience in the program, supporting the position that acos should be permitted additional time to become comfortable in the program without being forced into a risk-based model. permit acos that meet performance goals to remain in shared savings-only mgma recommends that, instead of requiring acos to move to a risk-based model following their initial years in shared savings-only (two years as proposed in basic tracks a and b or longer as recommended), acos that are still unprepared to assume risk that have met certain performance-based criteria should be permitted to remain in a track 1 equivalent model for as long as the aco continues to meet specified cost and quality criteria. mgma recommends that, as long as an aco is not continually losing money for the program and is maintaining high quality scores, it is in the interest of medicare to keep the organization in the program even if it does not proceed to a risk-bearing model. as long as savings and quality standards are met, acos in track 1 or an equivalent shared savings-only model should be eligible for continued participation in the mssp at the current sharing rate of 50 percent. acos that are not successful could be dropped from the program or pushed into a risk-bearing model, such as the proposed glide path to risk, where they would be required to pay back continued losses. since the inception of the mssp, cms has emphasized the need for acos to assume downside risk as the best way to reduce unnecessary expenditures. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 policy basis is that acos with downside risk achieve greater savings than shared savings only models. however, recent results discredit this assumption: in 2017, the 433 one-sided mssp track 1 acos saved an estimated $291 million, compared to $23 million in savings generated by track 2 and 3 acos. research also shows that acos demonstrate an increasing likelihood of achieving shared savings over time, which demonstrates the value of these models and the need to allow acos sufficient time to demonstrate positive results. for example, august 2017 findings from the department of health and human services inspector general and 2017 mssp performance results available in the public use file serve as evidence that acos need experience in the program to generate positive results and demonstrate change. mgma has concerns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 emphasis on the move to risk and assertion that high levels of risk are the key driver of cost savings and achieving program goals. given this backdrop, requiring acos to accept downside risk is not the only approach that cms could use to increase net savings to the medicare program from the mssp. we recommend that cms consider alternative approaches to accomplishing program goals aside from the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emphasis on requiring all acos to eventually move to high levels of risk as the only answer. for example, one policy expert identified several alternative ideas for increasing mssp savings, including:\n1. dropping acos from the program if they have not achieved savings after several years;  \n\n2. reducing shared savings payments to acos that incur large losses before generating savings; and \n\n 1717 pennsylvania ave. nw, #600 washington, dc 20006 t 202.293.3450 f 202.293.2787 mgma.org administrator verma\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 4\n\n\n3. allowing acos to take accountability for the specific types of spending they are capable of \n controlling, rather than total medicare spending.2 we recommend that cms analyze these ideas and other approaches and consider the advantages and disadvantages of alternatives to mandating a transition to risk-based models. glide path to risk for acos prepared to take on risk, mgma would support a voluntary glidepath to higher risk levels. however, mgma opposes forcing high-revenue acos to assume greater risk at an accelerated timeline and opposes requiring any aco to move into the enhanced track. instead, we urge cms to offer the enhanced track as a voluntary option for acos prepared for higher levels of risk and reward. acos prepared to assume risk should be able to remain in the equivalent of track 1+ (proposed basic level\ne). as recommended by mgma and other stakeholder groups, cms developed track 1+ as a new \n participation option that incorporates less downside risk than what is required in existing two-sided aco models. we greatly appreciate that this participation option qualifies as an advanced alternative payment model, as well as cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 plans to incorporate track 1+ policies into level e of the basic track. we believe, however, that acos should be permitted to remain in track 1+ or its equivalent indefinitely, without being forced to progress to the enhanced track. mgma members have expressed significant interest in the track 1+ model, and those already participating in it have reported positive feedback about experience. shared savings rate under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal, acos would have two years in an upside only model, with a shared savings rate that is reduced from the current 50 percent to 25 percent under the proposed basic track levels a and b. mgma urges cms to maintain a shared savings rate of at least 50 percent to ensure a viable business model. as mgma and others have repeatedly indicated, participating in an aco requires significant upfront investment and continuing financial expenditures for care management and operational changes. according to a report by the national association of acos (naacos), acos spend nearly $2 million a year on average for mssp participation, including investments made in health information technology, population health management, and administration. slashing shared savings payments in half would not allow acos to recoup those investments and would deter future participation in the mssp. risk adjustment methodology cms proposes modifications to its risk adjustment policies, including changes that would allow aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk scores to change over time. mgma supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to account for patient characteristics and changes in patient health status by allowing risk scores to change over time. the risk adjustment methodology used to in the mssp to date has failed to account for patient characteristics and changes in those characteristics that can result in the need for more care or more expensive care, which unfairly penalizes acos that have sicker patients. physician group practices that treat disadvantaged and vulnerable patient populations can be unfairly penalized by programs that do not have adequate adjustments for clinical complexity and socioeconomic factors. although the current proposal would allow acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk scores to change over time, the risk adjustment methodology still does not account for important factors in patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 health care needs, such as functional status and severity or stage of illness. we are also concerned that the proposed +/- 3 percent over the course of an agreement period is insufficient to account for changes year over year. without proper risk adjustment, cost and quality metrics could be tainted by any number of confounding variables, which could lead to unfairly penalizing clinicians for treating high-risk patient populations. accurate risk adjustment is necessary to\n 1717 pennsylvania ave. nw,

be outside the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control. benchmarking methodology cms indicates it is continuing to refine its aco benchmarking methodology and proposes a number of changes, including proposals that relate to incorporating a regional expenditure component into the rebased benchmark. in 2016, cms sought to create long-term sustainability in the mssp by introducing a regional benchmarking methodology for acos that enter a second or third contract. mgma supports incorporating a component of regional expenditure data into aco benchmarks during the initial agreement period, as currently proposed, rather than waiting until at least the second agreement period. however, while we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attempt to find an appropriate balance between a national and regional trend rate, there is need for continued improvement in this area. in particular, as mgma and other have repeatedly pointed out, we take issue with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 policy to include an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own attributed population in the regional benchmark. this has the effect of measuring an aco against itself, thus making it harder for acos to realize savings and be comfortable enough to assume downside risk. rather than comparing acos to themselves and other acos, cms should compare aco performance relative to the fee-for-service medicare population, by defining the regional population as assignable beneficiaries without aco-assigned beneficiaries for acos in the region. at the very least, cms should exclude the aco itself from the region to prevent a comparison that essentially double counts those aco-assigned beneficiaries. quality measures cms proposes to discontinue use of the quality measure 11 that assesses an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level of adoption of cehrt. instead, cms proposes that, acos in a track or a payment model within a track that does not meet the financial risk standard to be an advanced apm, would attest to meeting required cehrt levels. mgma strongly supports the proposal to remove aco measure 11 and instead rely on attestation to evaluate the use of cehrt. in announcing new initiatives related to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeaningful measures\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cpatients over paperwork,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms acknowledged the challenges associated with administrative tasks and committed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cremoving regulatory obstacles that get in the way of providers pending time with patients.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms should utilize this same approach\u00e2\u0080\u0093mitigating the misdirection of resources and promoting value over volume\u00e2\u0080\u0093in its strategies for future payment reform. conclusion we appreciate the opportunity to share our comments regarding the proposed changes to the mssp. should you have any questions, please contact mollie gelburd at mgelburd@mgma.org or 202-293-3450.\n sincerely,\n /s/\n anders gilberg, mga senior vice president,

administrator verma,\n on behalf of the clinicians, administrators, and team members of novant health medical group (nhmg), thank you for the opportunity to provide comments in response to provisions contained within the medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pathways to success proposed rule (the \u00e2\u0080\u009c2018 mssp/aco proposed rule\u00e2\u0080\u009d).1\n part of novant health, an integrated network of physician clinics, outpatient facilities and hospitals dedicated to delivering a seamless and convenient healthcare experience to communities in virginia, north and south carolina, and georgia, nhmg is a physician-led multispecialty organization comprised of more than 2,500 physician partners and other highly-skilled professionals providing care in over 550 clinic locations. nhmg clinicians participate in the mssp through two acos: 1) novant health accountable care organization i, llc, which in 2017 provided care to more than 78,000 medicare beneficiaries primarily in north and south carolina; and 2) novant health uva health system accountable care organization, llc, which in 2017 provided care to approximately 6,500 medicare beneficiaries primarily in northern virginia.\n we are committed to the transition from fee-for-service (ffs) to value-based care, and believe acos are some of the most important vehicles to ensure the success and sustainability of this transition. through\n 2 investments in the infrastructure necessary to effectively manage population health and the implementation of innovative clinical and operational approaches to improving quality while reducing costs, nhmg clinicians participating in acos are transforming care in our clinics and wellness in our communities. in our first year of participation, novant health acos generated more than $12.6 million in savings and outpaced the national average for all acos in reducing hospital discharges, readmissions, emergency department (ed) visits, and skilled nursing facility (snf) utilization.\n nhmg clinicians and our independent partners look forward to continuing and building upon these early successes as we progress through our first agreement period and look to subsequent agreement periods. we encourage cms to pursue policies which will encourage participation in acos by as many clinicians and organizations as possible across the nation. while cms has proposed multiple changes which will improve the program, we believe that clinicians need to continue to have both time and flexibility in implementing the clinical, cultural, and structural changes necessary to achieve success and move into more advanced downside risk models.\n below, please find our comments in response to specific provisions contained in the 2018 mssp/aco proposed rule.\n limiting the amount of time acos can remain in shared savings-only arrangements in the mssp from two 3-year agreement periods under track 1 to a maximum of just two years under the newly proposed basic track; gradually introducing downside risk for acos under the basic track. nhmg encourages cms to consider extending the amount of time acos can remain in shared savings-only arrangements. while the benefits of aco participation are numerous for both patients and clinicians, these benefits take significant time and investment to fully realize. patient engagement, transformation of clinical workflows, optimization of electronic health record (ehr) technology utilization, and transitioning to team-based innovative care can and often do require longer than two years.\n however, nhmg supports the proposal by cms to pursue a tiered approach to introducing downside financial risk for acos and their participating clinicians in the basic track. we believe this approach will strike an appropriate balance between encouraging the transition to downside financial risk while not creating an undue burden on clinicians and acos as they make this transition. as a voluntary program, cms must maintain appropriate incentives for participation in order to ensure the healthcare system does not slow its conversion to a system which prioritizes value over volume. nhmg believes that continuing to allow acos more time to prepare for downside financial risk and taking a stepwise approach to implementing downside risk models would achieve this goal.\n reducing the maximum potential shared savings under shared savings-only arrangements under basic track levels a and b to 25 percent. nhmg urges cms to maintain the maximum potential shared savings under basic track levels a and b at the current mssp track 1 level of 50 percent. current aco participants in mssp track 1 (who comprise the vast majority of current acos participating in the mssp) entering into the basic track and committing to a transition to downside financial risk would benefit from stability in the potential for shared savings.\n\n 3 eliminating the distinction between continuously and newly assigned patients for the purposes of risk adjustment; capping the maximum amount cms-hierarchical condition categories (hcc) risk scores can increase or decrease over the length of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreement period to \u00e2\u00b1 3 percent. nhmg fully supports the elimination of the distinction between newly and continuously assigned patients when calculating cms-hcc risk scores. the current methodology of allowing risk scores to increase for newly assigned patients based on hccs while only allowing risk scores to increase for continuously assigned patients based on demographic factors is flawed and does not adequately account for changes in health characteristics for acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 assigned beneficiaries. we encourage cms to include the elimination of this distinction in the 2018 mssp/aco final rule.\n however, nhmg believes that the proposed cap of \u00e2\u00b1 3 percent over the length of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 5-year agreement period does not fully address the issues with mssp risk adjustment. while a positive step toward appropriately capturing the complexity of assigned aco patients, nhmg encourages cms to consider a cap of at least \u00e2\u00b1 5 percent.\n decreasing the maximum amount of the regional adjustment in an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark to 50 percent and incorporating a national-regional blended trend rate. nhmg agrees with other acos and cms in their assertions that the current methodology for incorporating regional adjustments into the aco benchmarking methodology is in need of reform. however, we feel that the removal of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries from the regional reference population would be the most effective way to improve this methodology. particularly for acos in rural areas with higher market penetration in the counties that define their region, maintaining an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries in the regional reference population limits an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to achieve positive performance in reducing costs below their benchmarks. this is due to the fact that if an aco reduces costs for its own assigned beneficiaries, they would also reduce their own benchmark \u00e2\u0080\u0093 creating a flawed system in which acos are competing against themselves rather than other acos and organizations in their region. therefore, we encourage cms to consider the removal of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries from its regional reference population as an alternative to improving regional adjustments in the benchmarking methodology.\n eliminating aco-11 measure from the list of required of mssp quality measures. as utilization of ehr technology is a foundational piece of improving the quality of care, reducing overall costs, and creating a remarkable patient experience, nhmg applauds the removal of aco-11 from the list of required measures in the mssp. this proposed change alleviates administrative burden on clinicians, and we encourage cms to finalize this change as proposed.\n allowing acos greater flexibility in selecting the method of beneficiary assignment. nhmg supports the ability of acos to select either prospective or retrospective beneficiary assignment as codified in the bipartisan budget act of 2018, and encourages cms to finalize this change as proposed.\n granting acos currently participating in the mssp the flexibility to complete their current agreement period under existing program rules. nhmg supports the ability for acos to remain in their current mssp track under existing program rules through the end of their current agreement period. we encourage cms to finalize this change as proposed.\n 4 thank you again

electronically to www.regulations.gov\n dear administrator verma:\n thank you for the opportunity to provide athenahealth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective on the medicare shared savings program (mssp) \u00e2\u0080\u009cpathways to success\u00e2\u0080\u009d proposed rule.\n over the last twenty-one years, athenahealth has built a network of over 115,000 providers who care for 110 million patients in both the acute and ambulatory settings. we provide electronic health record (\u00e2\u0080\u009cehr\u00e2\u0080\u009d), practice management, care coordination, patient communication, data analytics, and related services to physician practices and hospitals. consistent with our model in which all of our customers use a single instance of our cloud- based application, we have aspired to connect with partners across the care continuum to enable our clinicians to improve the quality of care they deliver while demonstrating success in cms programs.\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts in the mssp proposed rule to foster a more accountable healthcare marketplace, while promoting interoperability through the wider adoption of ehr technology. our healthcare ecosystem must incentivize the seamless exchange of information and financial responsibility to achieve meaningful cost reduction.\n as cms continues to identify opportunities to overhaul the status quo in healthcare, we believe that the agency should continue its effort to reduce physician burden, focus on outcomes and promote interoperability. to advance these goals, we encourage cms to consider the following:\n\n1. increase alignment across quality reporting requirements \n\n athenahealth believes cms should examine all rulemaking with an eye towards reducing physician documentation burden and enabling innovative technologies to enter the market to support that mission. we believe that replacing meaningful use electronic health record quality measures with aco attestation that the majority of eligible clinicians use cehrt will add value to aco participants. however, cms should also be cognizant of the fact that, while the adoption of cehrt is certainly important to the success of acos, technologies falling outside of the scope of cehrt also contribute to success in two-sided risk programs. as cms continues to develop mssp quality measures as part of the meaningful measures initiative and those that would assess opioid utilization, we request that cms streamline these requirements with other medicare programs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and non-medicare programs when possible \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to reduce data collection and duplicative physician work. we also propose that cms avoid selecting a quality measure that is prohibitively difficult to calculate and track, particularly if such measures have not been proven to drive meaningful improvement in patient outcomes.\n\n2. reduce financial barriers for low-revenue acos to participate in mssp \n\n 2 cms has indicated that low-revenue, physician-led acos generate more savings for medicare, on average, than high-revenue acos. as the agency seeks to ensure that mssp remains accessible and attractive for smaller and lower-revenue acos, we encourage the agency to minimize financial barriers to entry. below are several recommendations to streamline cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data-sharing and reporting processes to lower costs incurred by acos and their technology partners.\n as athenahealth has experienced firsthand, the necessary investment in healthcare it systems is not an insignificant business decision for these low-revenue acos, which often exist on razor-thin margins. from athenahealth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience, financial hurdles for forming an aco have often deterred prospective groups from participating in mssp. alternatively, we have also experienced low-revenue acos successfully join mssp and demonstrate a real value add to patient outcomes amidst constraining financial situations. cms should continue to identify ways to allow private sector innovation to lower barriers of participation for physicians and technology vendors who partner with acos to demonstrate savings.\n currently, the operational complexity of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data sharing and reporting processes, as well as a lack of consistency in data formats, requires that technology vendors significantly invest in understanding and adjusting to changes. there is a real opportunity cost associated with this. every dollar that is spent untangling the complexities of mssp is routed away from innovation which improves outcomes at a lower cost \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the explicit purpose of this program. together, the following recommended changes would increase efficiency for vendors to ingest, render, and extract data on behalf of mssp acos and enable improved outcomes and greater cost savings.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 streamline cms data-sharing today, cms sends a quarterly package of information, including beneficiary assignment files (qassgns) and financial reporting, which is distinct from the monthly claim and claim line feed files (cclfs). we recommend that cms send the quarterly beneficiary package with updated eligibility each month with the cclf set. this change would enable vendors to manage a single set of data per cycle, allow for a more thorough and timely review of eligibility and client metrics, and eliminate the work of maintaining a member month creation model that infers membership based on a variety of factors.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 improve transparency and consistency of standards for cms data files current ambiguity around cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s logic for certain reports, such as the qexpu reports, creates substantial work for providers and vendors who are required to \u00e2\u0080\u009cback into\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms calculations. we recommend that cms either provide the reports monthly and/or provide acos with the necessary information to calculate this independently\n(e.g. non-claims-based payments, non-data-sharing financials, substance abuse \n claims).\n additionally, cms does not share documentation of the cclf and beneficiary eligibility data model with data vendors. we request that cms provide a schema diagram, entity relationships, and detailed description of data elements before they are combined or calculated, which would provide vendors more insight into how key fields and calculations are related and derived, which would allow more efficient and accurate mapping and reporting.\n 3 responsible provider associated with the beneficiary for the month in the cclf8 file and qassgns. this change would eliminate the work of determining and maintaining an attribution model that attempts to mimic cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 suggestions.\n additionally, cms should provide beneficiary addresses in either the qassgn or cclf files, which it currently does not, to improve efficiency in patient matching and reduce the need for manual patient merges.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 update gpro processes\n o extend file format lead time we request that cms send the file format specifications and sample data with more lead time - a minimum of 12 weeks before receipt of clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 files - to ensure that vendors have adequate time to plan for changes without disrupting client- facing initiatives, update systems to accommodate changes to file formats, and adjust operational processes that support clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reporting needs.\n additionally, we request that cms offer a testing environment in which vendors may upload submission test files and test the gpro ui to ensure compliance with the required specifications, rather than relying on clients to test submission files with phi after the reporting period has begun.\n we also ask that cms minimize year-by-year changes to gpro, only providing updates that offer clear, demonstrable benefit for participating providers and their technology partners. this will help drastically reduce the hours dedicated to explaining the interpretations of these measures and last-minute resource diversion. when changes are made, we ask that cms communicate them in a consistent and well-publicized manner to all stakeholders.\n o adopt a consistent, clear measure specification format today, cms has defined at least three different versions of each of their measures: machine-readable (ecqm), claims-based, and user reported (web interface/gpro). while we believe the ecqm is the source for the web interface specification, there are differences between the versions that suggest human error is at play. additionally, because cms sends measure specifications in a narrative format, both vendors and participating acos must interpret the narrative. this requires substantial effort to translate into code in order to enable tracking and monitoring on the measures, which makes it, too, prone to human error.\n we ask that the web interface stay true to the ecqm version of each measure, rather than provide a separate, narrative version of the specification. this will ensure that vendors supporting acos can code the measures accurately and avoid ambiguous, time-intensive work of interpreting and coding the measures. using the ecqm version would make automated reporting possible for provider organizations. automation would help providers eliminate administrative work (staff are needed to validate each measure and input) and reduce human error. in turn, fewer errors will reduce work needed during the reporting period to make corrections and other changes.\n 4 patient-level care gaps and empower them to provide higher quality of care. cms should encourage a more comprehensive perspective of patient health by incorporating data from all valid sources in the gpro submission process.\n o allow health technology vendors to submit aco clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gpro data currently, technology vendors are not provided access to submit data to the gpro interface on behalf of their aco clients. this results in either time-intensive effort of the clients themselves and/or the payment for temporary staff and service agencies to complete the submission. to relieve this undue burden on aco participants, cms should allow technology vendors to easily send quality measure data directly to the agency via industry-standard api.\n o adopt standard formats for export data and ingesting patient data the unique data ingestion format required for the gpro reporting process creates a substantial amount of work for vendors to reformat our exported data into a format that can be submitted. we recommend that cms use an industry-standard format for ingesting patient data. this should not be limited to mssp participants, but ideally apply to all medicare reporting programs.\n\n3. share prescription drug cost data to enabling more comprehensive cost \n tracking and reporting\n cms does not currently share information about prescription costs (e.g. ingredient cost, dispensing fee, coinsurance, copay, deductible, allowable, etc.). to further increase transparency in healthcare, we request that cms add prescription cost fields to the existing part d cclf file, including beneficiary payment information. this transparency would allow for improved analysis of pharmaceutical spending and the deployment of cost saving measures across aco participants, enabling them to achieve greater medicare savings.\n in closing, we believe the proposed mssp changes are a logical next step in the transition to value based care. we urge cms to use caution when implementing changes quickly and consider the role that technology vendors play as partners to their clients who participate in a variety of agency programs. technology vendors sit in a unique position to greatly lower the costs and improve the quality of care their physician clients deliver when they are free to innovate and compete on value of services delivered. athenahealth looks forward to working together with you on these important issues. please do not hesitate to reach out via email at gcarey@athenahealth.com or

organizations-pathways to success caribbean accountable care, in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking for: pathways to success for the medicare shared savings program (mssp), has compiled the following comments with reg.1 rds to this proposal. our comments are based on our experience as both a track 1 (2013-2015) and track 3 (2017-2019) accountable care organization (aco), and will cover the proposed regulations in the following areas: ~ redesigning participation options to facilitate transition to performance-based risk ~ providing tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement ~ benchmarking methodology refinements ~ updating program policies first of all, we want to acknowledge cms for its efforts to enhance mssp and agree that the current proposal contains certain changes which, under careful consideration and upon their implementation, should provide an improvement upon an already successful model. within these, we would like to mention our support t o: the 5-year agreement period, the glide path to performance-based risk, the annual participation alignment, the elimination of the current distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries; and policies on voluntarv alignment. as a track 3 aco, the only aco in puerto rico (pr) and after having experienced the direct impact of a major natural disaster, we raise our concern with certain proposed changes and/or program re-designs tha1 we believe will not have the intended result, and may, in fact, have a negative effect on the program as a whole. for these we are either presenting our recommendations as a voluntary participant of an aco and would like r othing but the outmost excellence that this program can achieve.\na. redesigning participation options to facilitate transition to performance-based risk. \n ~ caribbean '1 accountable care position to annually make a determination, with regards to which method is selected. it is c1 lso our recommendation that cms clarifies how the year-to-year performance comparison will be affected by 1the selection of different methodologies used for a,ssignment and therefore benchmarking. with regard to the application process for renewing acos, since cms is proposing 'the introduction of a monitoring approach and evaluation'- ariterion, related to financial performance, we recommend for ac: os that have successfully demonstrated positive results, in accordance with new criteria, to undergo an exp,edite application process. cms should provide for these acos a form such as a \"notice of intent to renew\", with minimal i1111ormation required. cms should also take into consideration those acos that experience an extreme and unc:ontrollable event during their agreement period, when applying the criteria for: losses negative outside corridor, pre\u00e2\u00b7-termination, repayment mechanism amount and final reconciliation after termination. we recommend t hat cms 1 ?xclude the performance year (py) financials (proposed participation-based for medicare ffs revenue and prior part cipation criteria), for the entire period during which the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policies are in place for a given event. by not providing such an option, some acos may be unfairly and prematurely terminated. in addition, we believe that acos that have demonstrated significant quality metrics imprc,vement, yet have higher expenditures, should be addressed differently when it comes to agreement termination. this may be the result of implementing a benchmark capped to a +3% hcc risk scores, where the adjustment for an aging/sicker population does not reflect the true impact that acos experience. section proposed rule/ assumptions\n1. proposal for \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the assumption is that

program\nc. providing tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement \n ~ caribbean '-/ accountable care additionally, we are in agreement with empowering beneficiary choice through voluntary alit nment and the changes proposed. on the other hand, we disagree and are opposed to the \"opted-in\" alternativ e. this proposal seems contrary to what is being sought out regarding beneficiary engagement. for the beneficiary, an aco is not a model of service that they are familiar with or have t he need to opt-in, as most cases it is completely t ransparent. this proposal i \\ needs further clarification, keeping in mind that an aco is a model for provision of services; a contractual form in which the provider agrees to offer the best quality of service to their patients at a lower cost. we would also like to point out that the relationship between a beneficiary and their physicians does not translate to a direct relationship with the aco. opt-in seems contrary to ffs beneficiaries' preferences, as it proposes a system significantly similar to ma, which can have the effect of reducing ffs and acos population. we are strongly opposed to opt-in as caribbean accountable care, along with other acos, are in a high ma market share penetration area and the opt-in effect will greatly impact our capacity to sustain the minimum number of assigned beneficiaries. section proposed rule\n1. beneficiary \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 allow certain acos to each \n incentives establish a beneficiary incentive program for assigned beneficiaries who receive qualifying primary-care services to encourage medicare ffs beneficiaries to obtain medically necessary primary care services \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 establish a cms approved beneficiary incentive program to provide incentive payments to eligible beneficiaries who receive qualifying services.\n2. beneficiary \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 to require additional content \n caribbean accountable care\n3. empowering \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 create an

beneficiary free choice, freedom t hat ffs medicare offers under which a beneficiary them. as proposed, opt-in seems would be assigned t'o an aco if significantlv similar to ma, which the beneficiary has \"opted-in\" can create c:onfusion between the to assignment to the aco. programs. it will also t e a burden to acos resources a!i it will require additional s\u00e2\u00b7,stems and resources to track, monitor and transmit opt-in data to cms.\nd. benchmarking methodology refinements \n ~ caribbean '-1 accountable care with regards to cms proposed modifications to use regional factors when establish ing and resetting aco's benchmarks, we favor the use of a blended national and regional trend factors, as long as ffii are exclusively acos ffs for the reginal trend factor. our recommendation is that cms takes into consideration hi,~h ma penetration areas upon the application of the proposed methodology for calculating growth rates used in establishing, resetting, and updating the benchmarks. our concern applies to other regions as well (in addition to pj; .), as this may become a potential problem, ffs and aco populations will get smaller with higher ma market penetration and therefor~ any comparison including ma would not reflect a true ffs comparative. in addition, pr has the lowest ffs of all us states and territories, therefore the trending and the limiting of the trending, considering ffs anomaly in pr will be potentially hurtful. for example, when comparing professional* and ip* payment rates in pr vs. fl (miami) ancl ny (queens), we found that: fl rates are 119% higher on professional and 152% higher on ip, and ny rates are 128% higher on professional and 184% higher on ip. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 please note that for both professional and facility we ore assuming a certain mix of services, and the ratio would change depem ling on that mix. for professional, we used a snapshot of ma data. far ip, we used national figures weighting on the top 10 drgs. section proposed rule\n2. risk adjustment \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 eliminate distinction between \n caribbean accountable care of national and regional update factors to update the historical benchmark for the py.\ne. updating program policies \n caribbean accountable care shared losses, but the effects of hurricanes irma and maria did reduce our shared savings substantially, negatively impacting our py 2017 finances. in addition, py 2018 is carrying over the high costs a~ sociated with beneficiaries accessing services in the mainland in an unusual rate due to, in some cases, forced migration that followed the natural disasters. not adapting the recommended changes could ultimately have the indirect effect of placing acos in financial difficulty, especially those being proposed as a low-revenue acos that are dependent on their shared savings to maintain their operations. caribbean accountable care cms financial reconciliation report for py 2017 states that the share of beneficiaries in disaster-affected counties was 98.05% and the share of year affected by disaster was set at 33.33% (or 4 months, sep\u00e2\u00ad dec), which demonstrates the impact and longing effect this natural disasters had on the li;land. pr saw a historically high number of its residents migrating to the continental us during the months follow,ing the hurricanes. the us bureau of transportation statistics (bts) reported in october 2017 alone 85,502 people left pr, after normalization of air transport between pr and the mainland. a more complete picture was provided by the american community survey (acs) which concluded that 135,592 puerto ricans had actually relocated stateside ,r~er hurricane maria. in our opinion, acos are being held responsible for reductions in shared savings result ing from the catastrophic events. in our case, the events that occurred in september 2017 were outside of our aco control but resulted in an increase in utilization and an increase in services rendered outside of puerto rico. in addition, in terms of the cms promoting interoperability proposal, we are in agreement with the elimination of ac0-11 and moving towards the requirement that all acos demonstrate a specified level of certified electronic health record technology {cehrt). we recommend that cms not make an unnecessary distinction in an area such as cehrt and are opposed to the different levels of percentages proposed; we instead propose that 50% should be the target that applies to all and then gradually increase over time. section proposed rule aco

accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success, as published in the august 17, 2018 federal register. we express appreciation for efforts to update the medicare shared savings

recommendations reflect our desire to see the mssp achieve the long-term sustainability necessary to enhance care coordination for millions of medicare beneficiaries, lower the growth rate of healthcare spending and improve quality in the medicare program.\n naacos is the largest association of acos, representing more than 6 million beneficiary lives through 370 mssp, next generation, and commercial acos. naacos is an aco member-led and member-owned non- profit organization that works on behalf of acos across the nation to improve the quality of medicare, population health and outcomes, and healthcare cost efficiency. our members, more than many other healthcare organizations, want to see an effective, coordinated patient-centric care process.\n the aco model is a market-based solution to fragmented and costly care that empowers local physicians, hospitals and other providers to work together and take responsibility for improving quality, enhancing patient experience and reducing waste. importantly, the aco model also maintains patient choice of clinicians and other providers. while the origins of medicare acos date back to the george w. bush administration, the mssp has grown considerably in recent years and now includes 561 acos, covering\n10.5 million beneficiaries. acos have been instrumental in the shift to value-based care and a central part \n of the aco concept is to transform healthcare through meaningful clinical and operational changes to put patients first by improving their care and reducing unnecessary expenditures.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n this fall naacos conducted a poll of to collect feedback in response the pathways to success rule to solicit input about the rule to help inform our comments. the survey, conducted by naacos through a web-based questionnaire sent to all mssp acos, drew 153 responses from 127 unique acos, representing 23 percent of mssp acos. naacos released a report on the findings from the poll, which is available here. there are a number of notable results detailed in the report which we hope cms will consider as it evaluates comments. for example, when asked about their aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall level of support for the proposed rule, 27 percent of respondents report favoring the rule while more than 60 percent report opposing the proposed rule.\n the levels of support and opposition were informed by what aco respondents identified as the top opportunities and challenges in the proposed rule. specifically, 57 percent of respondents reported concern with cutting shared savings rates for many acos from 50 percent to as low as 25 percent; 51 percent reported concern with designating acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009clow\u00e2\u0080\u009d revenue and requiring more risk sooner for \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh revenue acos\u00e2\u0080\u009d; 43 percent reported concern with shortening the time for shared savings-only acos from six years to two years; and 31 percent reported concern with capping risk adjustment at +/- 3 percent across five-year agreement periods. while risk adjustment proposals were identified as a challenge, they were also identified as an opportunity. importantly, sixty percent of acos reported that if finalized, they would have been unlikely to have entered the mssp as new acos under revised policies laid out in a proposed rule.\n in contrast, acos expressed support for a number of proposals in the rule and the top three opportunities were clear with the first, selected by over 55 percent of respondents, being the ability to choose an assignment methodology annually, regardless of mssp track or level. aco respondents noted their support for proposed changes that would expand use of payment waivers and beneficiary incentives with 42 percent of respondents selecting the expanded use of these waivers and introduction of the beneficiary incentive program as a leading opportunity proposed in the rule. citing a desire for increased program stability and predictability, slightly more than 30 percent of respondents chose the proposed shift from three-year to five-year agreements as the third most popular opportunity included in the rule.\n\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n summary of key recommendations as

rates for shared savings-only acos and to apply the following shared savings rates: 50 percent for basic levels a and b, 55 percent for basic levels c and d, and 60 percent for basic level e \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 not to finalize the arbitrary distinction of high and low revenue acos. we oppose requirements that high revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or any acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 not require any acos to participate in the enhanced track but keep that a voluntary model for acos prepared for higher levels of risk and reward \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 update the risk adjustment methodology by allowing risk scores to change by +/-5 percent over an agreement, as opposed to the proposed +/-3 percent range, and to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 finalize policies that support the move to regional benchmarking, including maintaining the current maximum of 70 percent regional expenditures, and remove aco beneficiaries from the regional population \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 not finalize the proposal to permit cms to terminate an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s

under proposed mssp structure track 1 basic level a and b track 1+ basic level e track 2 no equivalent track 3 enhanced track\n comments:\n renaming and restructuring the mssp\n we support the transition to the new basic and enhanced tracks, especially with the introduction of a more gradual glidepath to assuming risk in the basic track. this allows acos to gain exposure to risk in a more incremental manner than what is currently available in the mssp. we strongly support the permanent inclusion of the track 1+ equivalent, basic level e, which is an important option for acos assuming downside financial risk and allows loss sharing limits similar to those required for advanced alternative payment models (apms) in the quality payment program (qpp). that said, we have a number of concerns with the specific shared savings and loss rates included in the revised mssp, which are discussed in detail in later sections of this comment letter. the basic and enhanced track labels are more descriptive than the current labels for the existing mssp tracks. we recommend that should these name changes be finalized, that they stay in place moving forward to ensure continuity and understanding across the industry.\n moving from level e to the enhanced track\n while we are pleased with the more gradual glidepath to risk in the basic track, there remains a significant jump from basic level e to the enhanced track. in 2018, fewer than 7 percent of mssp acos elected to participate in track 3, the equivalent of the enhanced track. introduced in 2016, track 3 was meant to provide a more advanced option for acos ready for higher levels of risk and reward, but only a very small group of acos have chosen to participate. while the proposed rule provides some changes to the enhanced track, which also apply to other downside financial risk models in the basic track, there remains a massive jump in risk from basic level e and the enhanced track, with the latter requiring maximum losses based on total cost of care and capped at almost four times those in the basic level e. cms acknowledges this significant increase and requests feedback, stating on page 41818:\n\n 601

acos may not prepare to take on the highest level of risk that could drive the most meaningful change in providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099/suppliers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior toward achieving the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n establishing an aco and embarking on the related transformations inherent in population health are what drives changes in provider behavior. these changes often take years to generate results, as evidenced by the increasingly positive results for acos that are in the program for a longer period of time. we point to august 2017 findings from the department of health and human services inspector general (oig) and 2017 mssp results available in the public use file as proof that acos need time to generate positive results and demonstrate change. therefore, we have concerns with the assertion that high levels of risk are the key driver with changing provider/supplier behavior which would help achieve the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals. as harvard medical school researchers j. michael mcwilliams et al noted in their report, medicare spending after 3 years of the medicare shared savings program, published in the new england journal of medicine (nejm) on sept. 20, contracts with no downside risk contracts, which appeal to smaller organizations, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaybe effective in lowering medicare spending.\u00e2\u0080\u009d we urge the agency to focus on incentivizing the care transformations tied to population health and value-based care rather than focus on requiring risk as the sole mechanism to change provider behavior.\n the significant increase in the enhanced track risk level is based on an increased shared loss rate and a much higher benchmark-based loss sharing limit. the downside financial risk models in the basic track include lower shared loss rates and a revenue-based loss sharing limit, which caps risk based on provider revenue rather than total cost of care, which is the basis for the benchmark-based loss sharing limit. the enhanced track does not include a revenue-based loss sharing limit, and we urge the agency to create one and to create more options for gradual risk increases between basic level e and the enhanced track. it is also essential that cms revise its policies to keep the enhanced track voluntary, as with track 3, and not attempt to push acos into a model with levels of risk they are unprepared to assume. requiring acos to potentially pay millions of dollars to medicare is simply not practical or feasible for most of these organizations.\n it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to recognize that acos that are not ready for such high levels of risk under the enhanced track will not move forward; they will quit the program altogether. as mcwilliams and his colleagues noted in the nejm-published research, mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benefits \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould erode if policy changes, such as requiring acos to assume downside risk after fewer years of participation, cause acos to leave the program.\u00e2\u0080\u009d using a government mandate to assume high levels of provider risk is not the solution to increasing aco participation and achieving successful results for acos. the unintended consequences of forcing high levels of risk will significantly undermine the mssp and result in diverting valuable investments in care coordination away from medicare patients and towards other patients under value- based contracts. further, the disproportionate emphasis on reducing costs often overshadows the equally important goal of quality improvement that the aco model offers, which benefits patients and the medicare program generally. while some acos have not yet been able to experience a return on the investments they have made, they have generated savings to the government while improving patient care, which studies show has a positive downstream impact on spending, but may take years to fully materialize. for example, mssp acos generated gross savings of $1.1 billion for py 2017 based on the cms methodology for setting financial benchmarks. sixty percent of acos saved medicare money in 2017 with 34 percent of acos earning shared savings and 26 percent of acos generating savings for medicare but not enough savings meet the threshold (i.e., the minimum savings rate (msr)) needed to earn shared-savings payments. these acos are on the right path, and we urge cms to support them so they continue to generate savings for medicare and positive quality for beneficiaries. success does not equal assuming risk. we urge cms to allow all acos to remain indefinitely in basic level e without being forced to move to the enhanced track.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington,

specifically, for agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019, the length of the agreement would be five years and six months. for agreement periods beginning on january 1, 2020, and in subsequent years, the length of the agreement would be five years. cms also proposes to remove current restrictions that prevent an aco from terminating its participation agreement and re-entering the program prior to when the existing agreement period would have ended.\n comments: we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to extend the length of agreement periods from three years to five years, which will promote program stability. extended agreement periods allow acos a longer horizon on which to plan and to benefit from efficiency gains before benchmark rebasing. many acos have expressed the desire to have more program stability and predictability and shifting to longer agreement periods will enable that. we urge cms to finalize this change as proposed. we also support the proposal to modify current restrictions that prevent an aco from terminating its participation agreement and re-entering the program before the existing agreement period would have ended. this \u00e2\u0080\u009csit out\u00e2\u0080\u009d period is unnecessary and shuts providers out of participating in an essential cms value-based program. eliminating this restriction will allow the flexibility for an aco in an agreement period to terminate its participation agreement and then enter a new five-year agreement period under one of the redesigned participation options proposed in this rule. we recommend cms finalize this as proposed.\n timeframe to transition to risk\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to finalize a policy allowing all new acos entering the program to remain in basic track level a for two years and basic track level b for an additional two years before requiring the aco to move to level c in the fifth and final year of their agreement. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos also asks cms to allow acos meeting certain performance criteria to participate for a third year in basic track level b, providing acos that demonstrate superior performance with up to five years in basic track levels a and b.\n proposals: cms proposes acos would progress from shared savings-only to risk-based models under timeframes that apply to acos differently depending largely on previous program experience and aco type (high vs. low revenue). levels a and b of the basic track would be shared savings-only models, and after two years, acos would gradually assume more risk over time as they progress along basic track levels c through e. cms proposes to automatically advance acos over time across the levels and allow acos to elect annually to move up to higher risk levels in the basic track more quickly than what is required. the new proposed structure includes a more gradual glide path for assuming risk between basic track levels a through level e. however, there remains a significant jump in the risk level required when moving from basic level e (losses capped at 4 percent of the benchmark) to the enhanced track (losses capped at 15 percent of the benchmark).\n cms proposes acos would not be permitted to switch from the basic track to the enhanced track during their five- year agreement period. however, because cms proposes to eliminate the current restriction that prevents acos that terminate during an agreement from re-entering the program before the contract would have ended, an aco could terminate its contract and quickly move to the enhanced track under a new agreement.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n

reflected in basic evaluations of performance compared to cms benchmarks.\n acos have also demonstrated impressive quality results. a 2017 oig report, medicare program shared savings acos have shown potential for reducing spending and improving quality, found that acos achieved high quality and in particular noted progress on important measures including reduced hospital readmissions and screening beneficiaries for risk of falling and depression. recently released mssp performance year 2017 data shows a mean quality score of 90.5 percent out of 100 percent for acos subject to pay-for-performance measures. further, analysis of mssp performance year 2016 results shows that acos improve quality over time, with average performance improving 15 percent across 25 measures used consecutively across program years. evidence clearly shows that acos improve over time in the program and that shared savings-only models generate savings to cms and improve quality of care for the patients they serve. therefore, it is critical that cms allow acos to remain in shared savings-only models (basic track levels a and b) for more than the proposed two years.\n if finalized, there will be a detrimental effect on new applicants and participation in the aco program will be diminished. we request that cms modify proposals for all acos (including both high- and low-revenue acos) to allow more time to participate in shared savings-only models. specifically, naacos urges cms to finalize a policy allowing all new acos to remain in basic track level a for two years and basic track level b for an additional two years before requiring the aco to move to level c in the fifth and final year of their agreement. these acos should then be permitted to begin their second agreement period at basic track level d where they would participate for three years and progress to level e for the final two years of their second agreement period (with options to progress more quickly if the aco chooses). this would provide acos with four years of participation in shared savings-only models and a fifth year for those that demonstrate exceptional performance, as described below. providing acos with four years in shared savings-only models provides the aco with only two to three years of performance data, the minimum that would be necessary to identify trends and opportunities for transformation and improvement.\n naacos strongly believes acos who meet superior performance criteria should also be permitted to participate for a third year in basic track level b, allowing high performing acos to remain in a shared savings only model for a full five-year agreement period in cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed basic track. specifically, based on evaluation of the previous three performance years, we urge cms to allow acos that meet at least one of the criteria below to have a third year in basic track level b, giving the aco a full five-year agreement period in a shared savings only model:\n\n1. acos that generate net savings across three performance years: acos have demonstrated an increasing \n likelihood of achieving shared savings over time. this is likely the result of a combination of factors, such as their experience, realization of long-term commitments and investments in priorities such as care coordination, quality improvement, and data analytics. this trend is promising and means more savings over time for the medicare trust fund. however, many acos generate savings, as defined by having expenditures lower than their benchmark, but do not surpass their msr and thus do not qualify for earned shared savings. the msr in track 1 can be as high as 3.9 percent, which is a considerable hurdle. while these acos may not earn shared savings, they are saving medicare money and delivering high quality care. cms has no reason to discourage their continued participation. therefore, we urge cms to allow acos that generate net savings relative to their benchmark across three performance years (including those that do not surpass their msr) to have the option of continuing in basic track level b for a third year following their participation in basic track level a for two years.\n\n2. acos that score at or above the 50th percentile in quality in one of two performance years: acos that \n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington,

level a for two years.\n\n3. acos that improve their overall quality score by 10 percentage points or greater over the course of \n performance years: acos that demonstrate a significant improvement in their quality score have made a clear investment in quality and have had a positive impact on the medicare beneficiaries. these acos should be rewarded for these efforts and provided additional time to give their investments in quality an opportunity to materialize into cost savings, rather than being prematurely forced into a two-sided risk track. therefore, we urge cms to allow acos that improve their overall quality score by 10 percentage points over the course of the two performance years the option of continuing in basic track level b for a third year following their participation in basic track level a for two years.\n adopting these changes would provide acos with the time they need to transform health care through meaningful clinical and operational changes to put patients first by improving their care and reducing unnecessary expenditures. these transformations are significant and, as such, require time for implementation and to produce measurable results. acos are investing millions of dollars of their own capital to make these care improvements, even though medicare does not recognize these start-up and ongoing investments in its calculations of aco savings, losses, and costs. further, the benefits of these transformations extend beyond the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed medicare fee-for-service patient population and have a broader effect on medicare advantage beneficiaries and even patient populations beyond medicare. finalizing cms proposals to drastically reduce the amount of time available to acos in shared savings-only models will minimize the positive impact acos have on their communities. it is critical that cms provide acos with additional time in shared savings-only models to allow for a successful transition from fee-for-service to value-based care.\n shared savings and loss rates, loss sharing limits\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms not to cut in half the shared savings rates for shared savings only acos and to apply the following shared savings rates: 50 percent for basic levels a and b, 55 percent for basic levels c and d, and 60 percent for basic level e. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos strongly recommends that cms emphasize and reward above average quality performance or improvement by providing additional shared savings on a sliding scale up to 10 percentage points. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges the agency to lower the benchmark-based level e loss sharing limit to equal macra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally applicable nominal amount standard of 3 percent.\n proposals: as shown in table a, cms proposes a number of changes to the shared savings rates for basic levels a through d, as compared to the current 50 percent shared savings rate for track 1. specifically, under the proposed one-sided model, a final sharing rate would not exceed 25 percent based on quality performance and would apply to first dollar shared savings for acos that meet or exceed their msr.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n\n\n table a: new proposed mssp structure basic enhanced level a level

dollar losses at 40% to 75% not to exceed 15% of benchmark\n comments:\n shared savings rates\n naacos strongly opposes major reductions in shared savings rates from the current track 1 shared savings rate of 50 percent to as low as 25 percent under the proposed basic track levels a and b. this severe reduction in shared savings would drastically halt new acos from entering the program. since the release of the proposed rule, many acos have expressed concern about these reductions and stated they would not have entered the program as new acos with these inadequate proposed shared savings rates. as noted in a comment letter to this cms proposal from researchers at harvard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshared savings rates have been low in the mssp, allowing acos in track 1 to keep no more than 50 percent of the difference between its expenditures and its benchmark. because imperfect quality scores reduce the shared savings rate, it has been even lower, averaging 44.2 percent in 2014 and 47.8 percent in 2017.\u00e2\u0080\u009d therefore, in addition to the meager proposed shared savings rates for levels a through d of the basic track, it is important to note that these shared savings rates would likely be even lower than what is proposed when cms reduces them for imperfect quality performance. naacos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 members report spending almost $2 million a year on average for mssp participation, including investments made in health information technology, population health management and aco administration. such a drastic reduction in shared savings payments will not allow acos to recoup those investments and deter future participation in such a needed value-based payment program like mssp.\n the shared savings rates have been debated numerous times with many calls to increase shared savings rates above the current 50 percent in track 1 and 1+. for example, as shown in the excerpt below from page 67929 of the november 2011 mssp final rule which initially set the mssp shared savings rates, many commenters including medpac called for much higher shared savings rates, such as 75 percent, to incentivize aco participation.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommenters suggested sharing rates ranging from 50 to 95 percent (most commonly 75 percent) under the one-sided model and 66 to 95 percent (most commonly 80 percent) under the two-sided model. medpac recommended increasing the sharing rates for both models, suggesting, for example, offering a savings rate of up to 75 percent for the one-sided model and 95 percent for the two-sided model for the first agreement period.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n benchmarks. these savings are sure to grow over more recent years as more acos participate in mssp and gain the experience needed to produce positive results.\n there have been some public comments from cms leaders that acos in shared savings-only models do not generate savings. however, recent cms data on py 2017 mssp results, available in this public use file, shows this claim is not true. acos in shared savings-only models and those with downside financial risk both had net positive savings in 2017. in fact, as shown in table 4, the savings per beneficiary was higher for acos in track 1. further, one would expect the savings to be higher for acos in models with downside financial risk as to date, acos have self- selected to move to a risk-based model, which is typically the result of being successful in the shared savings- only model.\n table 4: net savings for acos based on track track net savings to medicare (millions)* means savings per beneficiary percent acos generating savings track 1 $290 $138 33% track 2/3 $23 $55 51% *net savings factors in bonuses paid to acos\n rather than make shared savings-only models less appealing, we urge cms to focus its efforts on making models with downside financial risk more attractive while continuing to support shared savings-only models. it is essential that cms structure the program such that it includes a business model attractive enough to retain current participants while bringing in new acos to create a pipeline for acos to advance on the path to value-based care. the proposed shared savings rates will fall short of that goal. therefore, we urge cms to maintain a 50 percent shared savings rate for basic levels a and b and to apply a 55 percent shared savings rate for levels c and d and a 60 percent shared savings rate for level e.\n further, we request cms adjust shared savings rates based on quality, which is a primary goal of the aco program. unfortunately, acos that achieve high-quality performance are not rewarded through increased shared savings or higher benchmarks. in contrast, medicare advantage (ma) plans are rewarded with higher benchmarks for higher quality, which puts acos at a disadvantage. as medpac noted in its feb. 2, 2015 letter to cms, \"otherwise, the aco with top quality performance would end up with a lower benchmark than an ma plan in the same market with top quality performance. that situation could be seen as inequitable for the aco.\"\n efforts to improve quality consume aco resources and increase spending relative to financial benchmarks in the short term, even if these efforts decrease medicare spending over the long term. for example, an aco that does extensive patient outreach for cancer screening, such as colonoscopies, could expend considerable resources delivering these services, which may prevent the need for expensive late-stage cancer treatments for the screened patients. acos that make large investments to improve quality performance may be less able to keep spending below their benchmarks as a direct result of their increased investment in quality. we urge cms to use a similar approach for ma and mssp by properly rewarding acos for high quality. it is important to recognize high-quality performance compared to established measure thresholds as well as to recognize \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and reward \u00e2\u0080\u0093 quality improvement relative to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous performance. therefore, to emphasize and reward above average quality performance or improvement, we urge cms to provide on a sliding scale up to 10 percentage points of additional shared savings.\n shared loss rates\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n at 20 percent and 25 percent respectively. this supports a gradual ramp up of assuming risk under an asymmetric approach.\n loss sharing limits\n cms notes the proposed approach for determining loss sharing limits would tend to place acos that include hospitals under a benchmark-based loss sharing limit because the participants of these acos typically have higher total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue compared to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark. we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to apply a loss sharing limit that is the lesser of the revenue-based or benchmark-based threshold. this allows flexibility for acos and does not place them in a particular category as a result of their aco participant composition. we recommend cms finalize this as proposed.\n we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to set the loss sharing limits for level e so those acos continue to qualify for advanced apm bonuses under the qpp established by the 2015 medicare access and chip reauthorization act (macra). however, we urge the agency to lower the benchmark-based level e loss sharing limit to equal the macra generally applicable nominal amount standard, rather than setting it one percent higher, as proposed. this would result in a level e benchmark-based loss sharing limit of 3 percent for 2019, which reflects the level of risk cms considers sufficient for macra advanced apms. this represents a more gradual increase in risk and aligns with the approach used for the revenue-based loss sharing limit, which is proposed to be set equal to, not higher than, the macra generally applicable nominal amount standard.\n cms explains that the agency would determine an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loss sharing limit annually at the time of financial reconciliation. while the agency notes this is consistent with its current process for track 2 and 3 acos, the timing of this determination is troubling. financial reconciliation occurs months after the close of the performance year, meaning acos would face uncertainly about their maximum potential losses until after the performance year is over. one of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals with the proposed rule is to promote predictability and stability, a goal shared by naacos. however, not knowing the maximum amount of losses an acos may face creates significant uncertainty that undermines cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on improved predictability and stability. participation in mssp tracks 2 and 3 remains low, and the uncertainty about potential losses is one of the reasons that has prevented more acos from joining these downside financial risk models. we urge cms to learn from this lesson and provide the loss sharing limit determination prior to or at the start of the performance year rather than at the time of financial reconciliation.\n high revenue and low revenue aco designations\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms not to finalize the arbitrary distinction of high and low revenue acos and opposes requirements that high-revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or any acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms not to require any acos to participate in the enhanced track but to keep that a voluntary model for acos prepared for higher levels of risk and reward. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos recommends cms reinstate advanced funding opportunities to help acos assume risk.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc

proposed definitions of high revenue and low revenue acos are as follows:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 high revenue aco means an aco whose total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue of its aco participants is at least 25 percent of the total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 low revenue aco means an aco whose total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue of its aco participants is less than 25 percent of the total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries\n the total aco revenue of participants would be based on revenue for the most recent calendar year for which 12 months of data are available, as would the total medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries. cms notes that that low revenue acos tend to be smaller, physician-led, and rural acos, which the agency explains are less likely to have access to capital to assume risk. therefore, cms considers but does not propose benefits to low revenue acos, such as providing them with a lower msr in levels a and b (1 or 2 percent) or using a higher shared savings rates such as 50 percent for levels a through d. cms notes that hospital- or health system-based acos will typically be considered high revenue acos, but hospital-based acos with relatively low aco participant ffs revenue compared to their benchmark would be low revenue acos.\n comments: in the proposed rule, cms states its belief that acos whose participants have greater total medicare parts a and b ffs revenue relative to their benchmarks have more ability to control costs and may be better financially prepared to move to greater levels of risk. accordingly, the agency notes that its comparison of revenue to benchmark would provide a more accurate method for determining an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preparedness to take on additional risk rather than an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-reported information regarding the composition of its aco participants and any ownership and operational interests in those aco participants. we do not support the current self-reporting requirements for track 1+ that result in acos falling under the revenue- or benchmark-based track 1+ loss sharing limits. we have previously urged cms to provide track 1+ acos flexibility to select either a revenue- or benchmark-based loss sharing limit, and we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to apply the lesser of the revenue- or benchmark-based loss sharing limit for basic level e.\n while we appreciate removing the self-reporting requirements under track 1+, we question the need to further divide acos into arbitrary categories of high and low revenue acos and to apply different schedules for how and when they must progress along the risk continuum. the proposed 25 percent threshold appears arbitrary and creates division where none should exist. we oppose categorizing acos in this manner and urge cms to not finalize the high and low revenue distinctions. all acos should be on the same path to assuming risk as recommended in this letter, which should include a gradual ramp up of risk, sufficient shared savings rates, and the ability to participate indefinitely in basic level e without having to move to the enhanced track.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south,

which cms has taken great strides to try to reduce across a variety of medicare programs in recent months. furthermore, the move creates uncertainty for acos who may have a difficult time predicting the category in which they would fall. this distinction would also change over time as aco participant composition changes, adding more complexity and making long-term planning very difficult. this uncertainty would be further compounded by the timing of the cms high/low revenue determination, which the agency explains would not occur until after the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application is submitted. should cms move forward with a high/low revenue distinction, we urge cms provide the final determination as early as possible in the application process, baring notable participant changes during the process which would change the determination. given the significance of this determination, acos must know in advance into which category they would fall.\n while we appreciate the gradual ramp up of risk in the basic track, the overall restructuring of the mssp has considerably more complexity with cms evaluating whether acos are new, renewing or re-entering, experienced or inexperienced with performance-based risk, high or low revenue, etc. eliminating the high/low revenue distinction would help minimize some of the complexity and would remove a significant amount of work required by cms and acos to model, predict, and determine if the aco would be high or low revenue.\n the administration has made comments about supporting market solutions and level playing fields among competitors. we appreciate that perspective and respectfully point out that this proposed policy is contrary to a market-based approach whereby all competitors have similar opportunities for success. rather than finalize unnecessary and arbitrary distinctions for acos, cms should work to support all acos as they progress on the value- based care continuum, and the agency should create meaningful incentives for acos to assume risk. the goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients, and cms should adopt policies that continue to engage hospitals as key players rather than create incentives to exclude hospitals as aco participants. the best way to drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate to innovate and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare. medpac addressed this in its june 2018 report noting, while hospitals may have certain conflicting interests that create challenges for aco participation, hospitals should continue to be part of acos.\n the administration has also noted concerns that acos are a potential driver of consolidation in the healthcare industry. there are no studies or data supporting this claim, which is a flawed assumption. reduced payment rates, increased regulatory burdens and requirements to assume risk are actual drivers of consolidation, and organizations often consolidate to more efficiently manage these challenges. further, acos do not drive physician employment and many effective acos engage a majority of independent clinicians. acos support greater clinical integration and collaboration among doctors, hospitals and other care providers and align the payment system to incent coordination and cost savings across these silos. this alignment accomplishes what the model is designed to do, and what providers need out of high-value networks, without necessitating consolidation and direct employment of physicians. in fact, these opportunities to collaborate often help providers avoid consolidation. the greatest fear related to consolidation is its potential to lead to higher prices. ultimately, one of the best ways to protect against escalating costs is to advance alternative payment models that hold providers accountable and rewards them for improving care and reducing costs for an entire population.\n in addition to our recommendations not to finalize the distinction between high and low revenue acos, we recommend that cms support acos by reinstating advanced funding opportunities to enable acos to assume risk. the agency previously offered programs to help fund acos up front, with those payments later recouped via shared savings. these programs, such as the aco investment model (aim) or similar ones, should be reinstated to help acos fund activities and transformations early on in acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 development.\n\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005

its proposal to allow acos in downside financial risk models to select a symmetrical msr/minimum loss rate (mlr) but requests acos be able to update this selection during an agreement period. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to lower the msr for shared savings-only models to be set between 2.0 and 2.5 percent.\n proposals: in order to qualify for a shared savings payment, or to be responsible for sharing losses with cms, an aco's average per capita medicare parts a and b ffs expenditures for its assigned beneficiary population for the performance year must be below or above the updated benchmark, respectively, by at least the msr/mlr. for acos under basic track levels a and b, cms proposes to use the same sliding scale for the msr that is currently used for track 1, which is based on the number of beneficiaries assigned to the aco to establish the msr.\n prior to entering a model with downside financial risk (basic levels c, d, e or the enhanced track), cms proposes to continue to have an aco select a symmetrical msr/mlr. this selection would be made as part of the application cycle prior to entering a model with downside financial risk and the selection would apply for the duration of the applicable agreement period. the aco would be able to choose from the following options, consistent with current policy: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 0 percent msr/mlr \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 symmetrical msr/mlr in a 0.5 percent increment between 0.5 and 2.0 percent \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 symmetrical msr/mlr that varies based on the number of beneficiaries assigned to the aco\n the variable msr/mlr would be determined based on the number of assigned beneficiaries as is currently used for two-sided model acos that have selected the variable option. cms also proposes to use a variable msr/mlr when performing shared savings and shared losses calculations if an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population falls below 5,000 for the performance year, regardless of whether the aco selected a fixed or variable msr/mlr.\n comments: we support allowing acos in models with downside financial risk to continue to have choices with selecting a symmetrical msr/mlr and request cms finalize this proposal. this flexibility is important for acos who may want to set an msr/mlr higher or lower depending on how conservative or aggressive their goals are for earning savings and having to repay losses. given the extended five-year agreement periods cms proposes, we urge the agency to allow acos to change their msr/mlr at the start of a performance year rather than be locked into that decision for up to five years of an agreement period.\n while the secretary has a statutory requirement to determine as msr based upon the number of medicare ffs beneficiaries assigned to an aco, there is no specific statutory requirement for msrs to rise as high as 3.9 percent for smaller acos. this creates a significant hurdle for smaller and rural acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 groups of providers cms has vowed to help \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to earn savings and thus a disincentive to join the mssp. we urge cms to use its authority to lower that threshold and revise the msr schedule for acos based on beneficiary population size such that the cap on msrs for smaller acos is 2.5 percent, and to meet statutory requirements, for larger acos would be set as low as 2 percent.\n early termination

cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to establish a june 30 deadline to voluntarily terminate aco participation agreements. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to provide acos with the ability to engage with high performing providers by allowing acos to select their participants by national provider identifier (npi) rather than solely at the tax identification number (tin) level.\n proposals: beginning on january 1, 2019, cms proposes to monitor whether an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expenditures for assigned beneficiaries population are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning that the expenditures exceed either the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative msr under a one-sided model or the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mlr under a two-sided model. if the aco is negative outside corridor for one performance year, cms proposes the agency may take pre-termination actions, including requiring a corrective action plan. if the aco is negative outside corridor for another performance year, cms proposes the agency may immediately or with advance notice terminate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement. cms also seeks comment on whether acos should be permitted to obtain reinsurance. cms proposes to reduce the minimum notification period from 60 to 30 days for early termination. this would allow acos considering a year-end termination to have three quarters of feedback reports, instead of two. for acos that voluntarily terminate after the june 30 deadline, cms proposes to pro-rate the shared-loss amount by the number of months during the year in which the aco was a participant in the program. cms also proposes to pro-rate shared losses for acos in two-sided models that are involuntarily terminated by cms. to calculate the prorated share of losses, cms will multiply the amount of shared losses calculated for the performance year by the quotient equal to the number of months of participation in the program during the performance year, including the month in which the termination was effective, divided by 12. cms also proposes special rules for acos that participate for a portion of a six-month performance year during 2019 (january 1, 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093june 30, 2019 or july 1, 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0093december 31, 2019):\n\n1. if the aco terminates its participation agreement effective

and prorate the amount reflecting the number of months during the performance year that the aco was in the program.\n cms notes that acos starting a 12-month performance year in 2019 would have the option to participate for the first six months of the year prior to terminating their current agreement and entering a new agreement period beginning july 1, 2019. cms proposes these acos would be eligible for prorated shared savings or losses for the six-month period from january 1, 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 june 30, 2019.\n comments: naacos has deep concerns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal

aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark by an amount equal to or exceeding either the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative msr under a one-sided model or the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mlr under a two-sided model after two performance years. cms notes the provision is intended to remove so-called bad actors from the program, however, naacos asserts this policy instead will have the unintended consequence of removing well intentioned acos from the program who might otherwise go on to achieve savings and make quality improvements for their patients.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington,

should not cause the aco to be deemed a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad actor\u00e2\u0080\u009d or penalized by being terminated from the program. while we support addressing valid program integrity concerns, we urge cms not to consider slightly elevated spending as evidence of fraud, waste and abuse.\n further, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside the corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d sets a very low bar, especially for acos in downside financial risk models where the aco can select an mlr as low as 0 percent. many acos view selection of the msr/mlr in a two-sided model as a significant incentive to move into a model with downside financial risk, but this proposal would create a double edge sword whereby an aco that wants to take on greater accountability through a lower mlr would be faced with potentially being kicked out of the program as a result of spending that exceeds their mlr. this proposal also does not make sense in the context of acos assuming risk, whereby once they meet or exceed their mlr they must pay back a portion of losses to medicare. requiring these acos to repay losses protects the medicare trust fund, and it is unnecessary at the same time to implement program policies aimed at removing acos from the program for having higher than expected spending.\n should the agency move forward with this type of early termination policy, at a minimum it should be used only in rare cases where the agency specifically has documented program integrity concerns. alternatively, naacos encourages cms to better serve beneficiaries and american taxpayers by creating a direct channel for acos to report suspected fraud and abuse. value-based delivery models such as acos have a unique vantage point and the properly aligned incentives to identify and ultimately report fraud. on average, a medicare aco is assigned 17,000 lives and includes hundreds of clinicians. its success depends on an aco continuously monitoring its expenditures. because acos are held responsible for the total cost of care for their assigned beneficiaries, acos are also monitoring services rendered by clinicians outside the aco and keep an eye on reimbursements completely removed from their own financial interests other than to achieve shared savings. that close attention to beneficiaries and the services they are accessing through medicare provides acos a frontline perspective to identify and report suspicious activity, yet acos have no direct access to cms program integrity. making this change would better support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stated fraud and abuse goals.\n should cms finalize its proposal to retain the right to terminate an aco whose expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside corridor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the agency must use a more appropriate standard to identify acos who would be subject to such a policy. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed approach would monitor specifically for whether the expenditures for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries exceed the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark by an amount equal to or exceeding either the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative msr under a one-sided model or the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mlr under a two-sided model. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed policy would have identified 82 acos in 2017 under these proposed criteria. of the 142 acos that earned shared savings payments for 2017 performance and had program experience prior to 2017, 36 percent had losses (i.e., expenditures higher than benchmarks) in one of their first two years of the program. such a policy would have removed these acos from the program prematurely, before they were able to go on and demonstrate success. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed policy is far too broad and contrary to the stated intent of the proposal to identify \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad actors\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the program.\n cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed approach is overreaching and it is critical that cms not move forward with this policy. further, should cms finalize this approach, the agency must also establish an appeal process for individual acos to submit information regarding errors they believe were made in the financial reconciliation calculation, determining the amount of shared savings earned by the aco or in determining an aco was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside the corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d. currently, cms does not provide a meaningful appeal process for individual acos. if cms will retain the right to terminate an aco for exceeding certain spending thresholds, cms must apply the materiality threshold to individual acos and allow acos to appeal redetermination decisions they believe were made in error and, therefore, hold acos harmless for errors the agency makes in the payment determination process.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900

to 30 days would provide more time for acos to evaluate program data and performance before deciding to terminate from the program without financial reconciliation for that year.\n we have significant concerns regarding the june 30 deadline proposed for acos electing to voluntarily terminate from the program. we urge cms not to finalize this policy as using a june 30 deadline for voluntary termination would mean that acos would not have the data they need to make an informed choice about their continued participation in the program. that data would not be available until later in the year due to the timing of distributing performance reports. acos should have three quarters of experience available to them to make a decision about their continued participation in the program.\n risk adjustment\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to implement the same risk adjustment policy across medicare programs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 as an interim step to implementing consistent risk adjustment policies across medicare programs, naacos supports the proposal to modify mssp risk adjustment by eliminating the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to allow risk score changes during an agreement period but urges the agency to use a more appropriate range of +/- 5 percent and to cap the risk ratios in aggregate across the four beneficiary enrollment types.\n proposals: cms proposes to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries for the purposes of mssp risk adjustment. the agency also proposes to use a symmetric +/-3 percent risk ratio cap between the performance year renormalized risk score and the most recent benchmark year for all assigned beneficiaries. cms would continue to use full cms-hierarchal condition category (hcc) risk adjustment for all assigned beneficiaries between the benchmark period and the performance year, and the risk scores would continue to be renormalized within each of the four beneficiary enrollment types. similarly, cms would continue to use full cms- hcc risk scores when resetting or rebasing the historical benchmark prior to each new agreement period.\n comments: risk adjustment modifies costs to reflect beneficiary health status and plays a critical role in enabling more accurate comparisons across acos and providers that treat beneficiaries of varying clinical complexity. there have been long-standing concerns about the mssp risk adjustment methodology, which cms acknowledges in the proposed rule, stating on page 41884:\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe appreciate the concerns regarding our current risk adjustment methodology raised by stakeholders, who have indicated that the current approach may not adequately recognize negative changes in health status that occur at the individual beneficiary level, particularly among continuously assigned beneficiaries who have experienced an acute event, such as a heart attack, stroke, or hip fracture, between the third benchmark year and the applicable performance year. we recognize that such acute events, which almost always require a hospitalization, are likely to have an upward impact on cms-hcc risk scores that is not attributable to provider coding initiatives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n participate in the mssp. as an interim step to implementing the same risk adjustment policy across medicare programs, we offer the following recommendations in response to those proposals in the pathways to success rule.\n the current mssp policy that treats beneficiaries differently depending on whether they are considered newly or continuously assigned creates unnecessary confusion and complexity. cms is in effect limiting risk adjustment due to demographic factors for continuously assigned beneficiaries. it is unreasonable to assume a provider organization, however effective, can manage a population such that patient conditions never worsen over time and it never carries a higher disease burden. therefore, we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to eliminate the newly and continuously assigned beneficiary categories and recommend additional changes to the risk adjustment proposals.\n we appreciate aspects of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow risk scores for beneficiaries to change somewhat over time, which begins to recognize the reality that patient risk scores fluctuate. it is essential that benchmarks reflect these risk changes so that acos are fairly judged on their performance without being unfairly expected to manage an overall population\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease burden with virtually no changes during an agreement period. naacos has repeatedly advocated for cms to permit meaningful increases in beneficiary risk scores over time. while the proposal would permit an increase of up to 3 percent, it is important to note that 3 percent is across a five-year agreement period and is not a year-over-year increase.\n though we appreciate the agency allowing risk score increases, the selection of 3 percent is arbitrary and insufficient when applied across a five-year agreement. for example, assuming that an aco starts in july 2019, the most that the risk score used in the updated benchmark calculation can change in performance year six (2024) would be between 97 to 103 percent of the 2018 risk score (based on 2017 hcc coding practices). this risk adjustment proposal would be reasonable in early years of the agreement period, when most acos would hit the 3 percent cap, but it would not be reasonable when applied to later years of the agreement. using mssp py 2017 results, 87 percent of acos would have had at least one enrollment type trigger the +/-3 percent cap when looking at the first three years of the agreement period. the average percentage capped in the first performance year of the agreement period is 88 percent, in the second performance year is 85 percent and the third performance year is 92 percent. over the fourth and fifth performance years we would expect the percentage of acos affected by the risk score cap to increase. we recommend cms finalize a policy that allows risk score adjustments during the course of the agreement period, but we urge a more reasonable threshold of +/- 5 percent. this is the threshold at which the percentage of capped aco populations within the same enrollment type drops below 25 percent based on the 2017 mssp results.\n alternative to the proposal, we support cms capping the risk ratios in aggregate across the four beneficiary enrollment types (esrd, disabled, aged/dual eligible, and aged/non-dual eligible). the different enrollment types show significantly different cap rates with aged/dual the highest at 59 percent capped and aged/non-dual the lowest at 24 percent capped in 2017 due to smaller sample sizes and volatility for certain enrollment types. we recommend cms finalize capping the enrollment types in aggregate instead of separately by enrollment type conjunction with the broader +/- 5 percent cap in order to further promote benchmark stability.\n finally, in order to reduce benchmark volatility, the risk adjustment model version should be consistent between the baseline and performance years. for example, the version 23 cms-hcc model could be used when comparing risk scores in the 2016-2018 baseline period to those in the 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2024 performance period. the next generation aco program follows this convention demonstrating that it is administratively feasible to maintain a consistent risk adjustment model version throughout the baseline and performance periods.\n benchmarking methodology\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south,

regional expenditure component to 50 percent and recommends that agency maintain the current maximum of 70 percent of regional expenditures in the third agreement and subsequent agreement periods. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos does not support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a symmetric +/- 5 percent cap based on national per capita expenditures and recommends the agency not finalize this. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to find an appropriate balance between a national and regional trend rate, but instead of finalizing the proposal we request the agency remove aco beneficiaries from the regional reference population to address the underlying problem. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to reverse its position on adjusting rebased benchmarks to account for the average per capita amount of savings generated during an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous agreement period by adding those savings back to the rebased benchmark. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to adjust the mssp benchmarking methodology to remove certain expenditures such as those related to mips payment adjustments, cpc+ care management fees and hospital wage index changes.\n proposals: cms proposes a number of benchmarking changes that, if finalized, would go into effect along with the revised mssp structure. many of the proposals relate to incorporating a regional expenditure component into the rebased benchmark, a direction the agency finalized in 2016 with the mssp rule, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 revised benchmark rebasing methodology, facilitating transition to performance-based risk, and administrative finality of financial calculations (published in the june 10, 2016 federal register). under that regulation, which remains in place as existing policy, cms incorporates a growing component of regional expenditures into benchmarks as they are rebased for new agreement periods. in this rule, cms proposes to incorporate regional expenditures into benchmarks sooner, beginning with initial agreement periods and to cap the maximum amount of regional expenditures at 50 percent. this would modify the phase-in schedule such that acos would have a regional expenditure component of:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 25 or 35 percent during the first agreement period, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 35 or 50 percent during the second agreement period, and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 50 percent during third and subsequent agreement periods.\n consistent with current policy, acos with spending higher than their region would receive the lower adjustment, and acos with spending lower than their region would receive the higher adjustment. cms also proposes to introduce a symmetric +/- 5 percent cap, implemented separately for each beneficiary category, and based on national per capita expenditures. if an aco is considered a re-entering aco, cms proposes to apply the regional adjustment percentage that was used in the most recent agreement. cms also proposes to use a blend of national and regional trend factors to trend forward benchmark year (by)1 and by2 to by3 when determining the historical benchmark and a blend of national and regional update factors to update the historical benchmark to the performance year (or to calendar year 2019 in the context of determining the financial performance of acos for the six-month performance year from july 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019). the national component of the blended trend and update factors would receive a weight equal to the share of assignable beneficiaries in the regional service area that are assigned to the aco, computed by taking a weighted average of county-level shares. the regional component of the blended trend and update factors would receive a weight equal to 1 minus the national weight.\n comments: naacos supports incorporating a component of regional expenditure data into aco benchmarks. rather than exclusively relying on regional expenditure data we specifically support blending aco historical and regional expenditure data for rebased benchmarks. relying exclusively on regional expenditure data for rebased benchmarks would not properly reflect an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique patient population. relying exclusively on historical aco expenditure data creates an unattainable situation where acos have decreased ability to beat ever-lowering benchmarks. if executed correctly, using benchmarks with a blend of historical and regional expenditure data will attract new acos while retaining existing participants and ultimately improve the long-term viability of the program.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n we support the proposal to introduce a regional expenditure component into the initial agreement period, rather than waiting until at least the second agreement period. this is especially important with longer, five-year agreement periods. we also strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued application of one of two regional expenditure components based on how the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending compares to that of its region, and the proposed 25 percent and 35 percent thresholds are appropriate. we recommend cms finalize these as proposed.\n as cms gradually introduces regional expenditures, for third and subsequent agreement periods we urge the agency not to finalize its proposal to cap regional expenditures at 50 percent. this is a decrease from the current policy of applying a maximum of 70 percent regional expenditure data. this policy was finalized two years ago and given the phase-in schedule of regional expenditure data, acos have not yet reached this level so it is premature to reverse this policy. we support a maximum of 70 percent of regional expenditures in the third agreement and subsequent agreement periods and recommend the following phase-in schedule such that acos would have a regional expenditure component of:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 25 or 35 percent during the first agreement period, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 45 or 60 percent during the second agreement period, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 70 percent during third and subsequent agreement periods\n we also urge cms to allow an option for acos to gradually incorporate regional expenditure data by 10 percent annually into their benchmarks during an agreement period. some acos will face significant swings in their aco benchmarks as a result of the revised methodology and allowing a gradual implementation would ease this transition rather than require acos to face large swings at the start of an agreement period. we reiterate our recommendation that this should be an option, and acos that are prepared to face more significant changes at the start of an agreement should be permitted to do so. overall, acos would ultimately reach the 70 percent regional benchmark, but providing program flexibility would keep acos progressing on the right path in a more reasonable manner that incentivizes them to stay in the program and continue focusing on reducing costs and improving quality.\n in response to cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a symmetric +/- 5 percent cap based on national per capita expenditures, we are concerned that this will unnecessarily limit market forces that would naturally constrain outliers resulting from implementation of regional expenditures into rebased benchmarks. in the proposed rule, cms notes its concern that the agency should guard against the effect of large positive or negative regional adjustments resulting from the revised benchmarking methodology by imposing a cap on the dollar amount of the regional adjustment. however, we do not agree that cms should intervene in the market in this manner and instead should allow competition among acos and other providers to address and eventually mitigate outlier situations. should the agency move forward with implementing such a cap, we recommend a more reasonable range of +/- 7 percent as opposed to +/- 5 percent.\n in response to concerns raised by naacos and others, cms proposes to no longer use a pure regional update factor, which disadvantages acos that make up a large portion of the market in their region. instead, cms proposes to modify the update factor by using a national-regional blended trend rate that would be based on the share of assignable beneficiary weighted national ffs and regional update factors. the national-regional blending factor would be determined by averaging the market penetration across all counties where the aco has assigned beneficiaries. this proposal is a step in the right direction to address some of our concerns with the regional update factor; however, we have concerns that the new methodology may over-emphasize the national trend component. there are pitfalls with solely using a national update factor, which ignores important local market dynamics and regional trends, and with using an exclusively regionally-based update factor, which as currently structured penalizes acos in rural areas and those that comprise a large share of their market and, therefore, drive regional trends.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n address the underlying problem caused by including aco beneficiaries in the population from which the regional expenditure data is drawn. in fact, a simpler solution to the proposed national-regional trend rate would be to remove aco beneficiaries from the regional reference population as naacos has previously recommended. by excluding aco beneficiaries from the regional reference population, the situation where an aco is being directly evaluated against itself within the same performance year is eliminated.\n naacos and others have repeatedly made this recommendation to cms, including in our comment letter in response to the 2016 mssp rule, and our concerns remain the same. rather than comparing acos to themselves and other acos, cms should compare aco performance relative to ffs medicare by defining the regional population as assignable beneficiaries without aco-assigned beneficiaries for all acos in the region. at the very least, cms should exclude the aco itself from the region to prevent an otherwise tautological comparison that essentially double counts those aco-assigned beneficiaries. in an area where the aco has significant market saturation, it is especially essential to remove the aco beneficiaries from the regional population to avoid comparing the aco to itself.\n excluding all aco-assigned beneficiaries (those involved in mssp acos and well as other cms aco demonstrations such as the next generation model) also allows for a cleaner comparison between acos and ffs. by including the aco-assigned beneficiary population, the regional cost data is skewed by reflecting acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to coordinate care and reduce expenditures for the aco population. cms has expressed concerns that removing aco-assigned beneficiaries would result in an insufficient reference population. however, according to our analysis based on 2017 data, if cms removed aco-assigned beneficiaries from the service area no acos would have a reference population smaller than about 300,000 beneficiaries. further, the contribution of beneficiaries from very small and aco- dominated counties to the regional benchmark is minimal with only 47 (10 percent) 2017 acos exposed to one or the other, with such counties contributing only as much as 4 percent of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall assigned population. continuing a flawed program methodology in order to address a small percentage of acos is nonsensical and, more importantly, harmful to the majority of program participants. we urge cms to modify its policy by changing the definition of the reference population to exclude all aco-assigned beneficiaries.\n to address those acos whose reference population falls below 5,000 after removing the aco-assigned beneficiaries, we recommend cms use a modified approach to reach 5,000 beneficiaries in those instances. for example, cms could bridge the gap by increasing the weight of the counties that have a lower proportion of resident aco beneficiaries, and thus higher ffs population. another option would be for cms to expand the regional service area to include assignable beneficiaries in adjoining counties until a sufficient comparison group is reached. yet another option, recommended by medpac in their march 11, 2016 comment letter to cms, would increase the stability of the regional ffs spending calculations by increasing the number of years of data included in the calculation. for example, by using a five-year rolling average for county level spending estimates. in cases where area expenditures are driven largely by the acos, cms could similarly pull in contiguous counties to ensure a fair comparison. these approaches would both address cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concern about not having an adequate reference population and would be preferable to the current methodology.\n additionally, we recommend cms consider using a prospectively determined trend rate which would allow for greater predictability of financial results by acos. for example, prospective trend in us per capita cost is used to establish trend rates in the next generation model and medicare advantage programs. it is recommended that similar prospective trend approach be used in the mssp. finally, we urge cms to reverse its position on adjusting rebased benchmarks to account for the average per capita amount of savings generated during an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous agreement period by adding those savings back to the rebased benchmark. cms has changed its policy on adding aco savings back to benchmarks a few times, and the most recent policy finalized in the june 2016 mssp rule no longer adds these savings to benchmarks. this final policy was disappointing considering cms had previously expressed support for adding the savings back to benchmarks and in a june 2015 mssp rule stated:\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n who have achieved success in achieving the three-part aim in their first agreement, by lowering expenditures and improving both the quality of care provided to medicare ffs beneficiaries and the overall health of those beneficiaries. absent this adjustment, an aco who previously achieved success in the program may elect to terminate its participation in the program rather than face a lower benchmark that reflects the lower costs for its patient population during the three most recent prior years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (80 fr 32778)\n savings generated by acos are achieved as a result of their hard work to improve quality and lower costs. acos should be accountable for their performance relative to ffs medicare in their region and rewarded \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not penalized - for previous savings. thus, we urge cms not only to account for the earned shared savings in rebased benchmarks, but also to account for all savings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and add that amount to rebased benchmarks. at a very minimum, cms should return to the policy in the 2015 mssp rule which accounts for a portion of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s savings in rebased benchmarks.\n along with the benchmark adjustments discussed above, we urge cms to implement other benchmark adjustments so as to not hold acos accountable for specific expenditures that are inconsistent between the benchmark and performance years. for example, cms should adjust benchmarks to hold constant changes from the hospital wage index, as these payment changes can be notable and are not reflective of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population management efforts but can dramatically effect on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to accurately demonstrate savings or losses.\n as discussed previously in this letter, we also urge cms to exclude mips bonuses as aco expenditures. the current cms policy unfairly punishes acos for their high performance by both requiring track 1 acos (and basic levels a, b, c and d as proposed) to participate in mips, excluding such acos from advanced apm bonuses and counting any mips bonuses earned for high performance in that program as aco expenditures. cms excludes advanced apm bonuses from aco expenditures and should do the same for mips expenditures. this will be increasingly important over time as mips bonuses rise in future program years. not removing mips bonuses as aco expenditures will result in fewer acos being able to surpass their msr and could cause acos in basic levels c and d to have to repay losses. cms makes claim-level adjustments by adding sequestration costs back to paid amounts when calculating aco expenditures and should follow a similar policy to adjust for mips payment adjustments. it was not the intent of congress to penalize acos in mips, and therefore cms must alter this policy.\n finally, we urge cms to remove cpc+ care management fees from aco expenditures. while we appreciate the opportunity for mssp primary care practices to participate in cpc+, the care management fees should not be included as expenditures for aco benchmarks. these funds are paid to the participant tins and should be viewed as separate from other payments for furnishing care to beneficiaries. by not removing these care management fees from aco expenditures, cms penalizes acos with practices that receive these payments which are often used to invest in care coordination activities that will provide long-term benefits to patients. this creates an unhelpful tension between cpc+ and acos, rather than an approach that would harmonize the two programs. we urge cms to address this by removing cpc+ fees from aco expenditures.\n 2019 participation options\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to provide next gen acos with the opportunity to participate in the revised mssp using the july 1 start date.\n proposals: cms is opening a new round of applications for 2019 with a shortened six-month performance period in 2019 due to the late nature of the regulation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release. for aco agreements that expire at the end of 2018, acos will have the option to extend current agreements for six months while offering a special, one-time july 1, 2019 start date for new agreements. the july 1, 2019 start will have a spring 2019 application period, and this start date option is also available to new acos. cms staff have also confirmed with naacos that as proposed acos within current agreement periods under mssp participation options (track 1, track 2, or track 3) would be able to complete the remainder of their current agreement under the existing financial models and requirements.\n program participation options are limited in some cases for acos with experience in a performance-based risk model as well as for acos designated as high revenue. additionally, participation options are determined in part based on whether cms considers an aco to be new, renewing, or re-entering. cms proposes to allow new acos to begin in level a of the basic track, and they would stay in the shared savings-only option (level b in performance year (py) 2) for the first two consecutive performance years. only acos that are inexperienced with performance-based risk can elect to participate in the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glidepath. acos identified as experienced with performance-based risk must enter the basic track at level e if considered a low-revenue aco and must enter in the enhanced track if considered a high-revenue aco. low-revenue acos could participate in the basic track for up to two agreement periods, while high-revenue acos would be restricted to one agreement period in the basic track.\n cms proposes to define \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing acos\u00e2\u0080\u009d as those that continue in the program for a consecutive agreement period without a break in participation and are either:\n1. acos whose participation agreements expired and they immediately enter new agreement periods to \n continue participation in the program; or\n2. acos that voluntarily terminated their current participation agreements and they immediately enter new \n agreement periods to continue participation in the program.\n cms proposes to define \u00e2\u0080\u009cre-entering acos\u00e2\u0080\u009d as those that do not meet the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d and are either:\n1. the same legal entity as (a) an aco whose participation agreement expired without having been \n renewed; or (b) an aco whose aco participation agreement was terminated, or\n2. a new legal entity with more than 50 percent of its aco participants included on the aco participant list \n of the same aco in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date. re- entering acos are ineligible for level a and must begin at level b of the basic track.\n cms proposes to define acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced with performance-based risk\u00e2\u0080\u009d if either of the following are met:\n1. the aco is the same legal entity as a current or previous participant in a performance-based risk \n medicare aco initiative; or\n2. 40 percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco \n initiative in any of the five most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n finally, cms defines \u00e2\u0080\u009cperformance-based risk medicare aco initiative\u00e2\u0080\u009d as: basic track, enhanced track (track 3), track 2, track 1+ model, pioneer aco model, next generation aco model, and comprehensive end-stage renal disease (esrd) care model two-sided risk tracks. all acos can elect to participate in the enhanced track. tables 6 and 7 in the proposed rule on pages 41833-41834

participation and gather all of the required information to submit applications, it is critical that cms continue to offer a participation option for 2019. naacos has concerns regarding complexity caused by the introduction of two, six- month performance periods with some acos operating under current program rules and others operating under new program rules. we request that cms clarify how such details will be handled (please see our detailed comments below under \u00e2\u0080\u009cassessing six-month performance periods in 2019\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\n in addition, we urge cms to provide acos with agreements expiring in 2018 the option of extending their current participation agreements from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019. providing this option would give acos additional time to analyze program changes and prepare for the application process while reducing complexity. cms must also provide acos with opportunities to add and delete participants throughout the performance periods offered in 2019 and clarify when such opportunities will be permitted.\n additionally, naacos urges cms to provide next gen acos with the opportunity to participate in mssp using the july 1 start date option. cmmi has finalized many changes for the final two years of the next generation model, 2019 and 2020, and some acos have concerns about certain revisions. as such, we urge cms to work closely with cmmi to provide an opportunity for interested next gen acos to transition to mssp effective july 1, 2019 without having to sit out of an accountable care model for the start of 2019. allowing a smooth and timely transition will enable interested acos and providers to avoid disruption in their accountable care goals while moving from one program to the other.\n naacos supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to define acos re-entering or renewing. however, we disagree with the proposal to limit participation options for acos with any experience in performance-based risk models. particularly in cases where the aco may have only participated in such a model for one performance year, we do not feel it is justified to limit an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation to either the basic level e or enhanced track options. additionally, as noted previously in this comment letter, the levels of risk required for the enhanced track are a large jump from those required in basic level e. given this dramatic increase, cms should not force acos to participate in the enhanced track. instead, we recommend cms only limit an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation to basic level e if such aco had completed at least one agreement period in a performance-based risk model. further, and echoed in our comments above on the proposed high/low revenue distinction, we do not support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to require high revenue acos with experience in performance-based risk models to participate in the enhanced track. in fact, we urge cms not to finalize the arbitrary distinction of high- and low-revenue acos, and we oppose requirements that high-revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or any acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e.\n assessing six-month performance periods in 2019 key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos appreciates cms proposals to offer aco participation options in 2019. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed policies governing how shared savings and losses will be calculated for the six-month performance periods in 2019. however, cms must clarify and provide additional education to acos concerning how certain operational details will be addressed. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms must clarify how quality reporting would take place for six-month performance periods that will be based on 12 months of data and how such reporting will be considered in mips.\n proposals: cms proposes to reconcile the financial and quality performance of acos that participated in the mssp in 2019. given the varying participation options in 2019, cms proposes to treat each six-month period separately for purposes of calculating financial and quality performance. these calculations would be reconciled based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance during the entire 12-month calendar year, but cms would prorate the calendar year shared savings or losses based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance during the applicable six-month period.\n january 1, 2019 to june 30, 2019\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900

retrospective reconciliation, the assignment window would be calendar year 2019. for acos under prospective assignment, cms proposes the assignment window would be october 1, 2017 through september 30, 2018, with beneficiaries remaining prospectively assigned to the aco at the end of calendar year 2019 unless the beneficiary meets certain exclusion criteria. lastly, beneficiary assignment would be based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certified aco participant list for the agreement period beginning january 1, 2019.\n benchmark cms proposes to calculate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark and assigned beneficiary expenditures as though the six-month performance year were the entire calendar year. the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark would be determined according to the applicable methodology of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s track and agreement with cms, except that data from the entire calendar year 2019 would be used in place of data for the six-month performance year for the benchmarking approaches cms currently uses to update and adjust historical benchmarks. thus, the existing methodology would be used to determine the benchmark for the january 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 june 30, 2019 performance year by performing the following calculations: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 benchmarks would be adjusted for changes in severity and case mix between benchmark year three and calendar year 2019 using the current hcc risk score and demographic factors methodology; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 benchmarks would be updated to calendar year 2019 according to the methodology for using growth in either national or regional medicare ffs expenditures, depending on whether the aco is in its first or second agreement period and whether the second agreement period began in 2016 or 2017\u00e2\u0080\u00932019.\n financial performance cms would apply the methodology for determining shared savings and losses according to the track the aco is participating in on january 1, 2019, with the following exceptions to the applicable methodology implemented to calculate the expenditures for assigned beneficiaries over the full calendar year for purposes of determining the shared savings and losses for the six-month performance year: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 average per capita medicare parts a and b services expenditures for calendar year 2019 would be calculated for the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance year assigned beneficiary population; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms would compare the expenditures to the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated benchmark, determined for calendar year 2019 as listed above; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms would apply the msr or mlr, if applicable; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms would prorate any amounts of shared savings or losses by multiplying those amounts by 50 percent, which represents the portion of the calendar year covered by the six-month performance year.\n quality performance for acos participating in tracks where shared savings or losses are affected by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance, cms would multiply the difference between the updated benchmark expenditures by the applicable msr or mlr based on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality performance.\n july 1, 2019 to december 31, 2019\n cms proposes to apply the same general methodological steps for calculating prorated shared savings and losses as described above for the six-month performance year from january 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 june 30, 2019, except where the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreement and track stipulates a different methodology, for

urge cms to allow acos currently participating using prospective assignment who extend current agreements through june of 2019, the option to use the same assignment window for the july- december performance period to avoid unintended consequences and complexity caused by creating two assignment windows for these acos. additionally, cms must clarify how quality reporting will take place for six-month performance periods that cms states will be based on 12 months of data. in the proposed rule, cms notes the agency would use the certified aco participant list for the performance year starting on july 1, 2019, to determine the quality reporting samples for the 2019 reporting period for certain acos (acos that enter an agreement period beginning on july 1, 2019, including new acos, and acos that extended their prior participation agreement for the six-month performance year from january 1, 2019, to june 30, 2019, as well as acos that start a 12-month performance year on january 1, 2019, and terminate their participation agreement with an effective date of termination of june 30, 2019, and enter a new agreement period beginning on july 1, 2019). if an aco extends its participation to the first six months of 2019 but does not enter a new agreement period beginning on july 1, 2019, cms proposes to use the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest certified participant list (the aco participant list effective on january 1, 2019) to determine the quality reporting samples for the 2019 reporting period. beneficiary assignment for purposes of generating the quality reporting samples would be based on the assignment methodology applicable to the aco during its six-month performance year. given this, we assume all acos would only be responsible for reporting quality one time, during the typical january to march timeframe following the performance year. cms must clarify how such quality reporting will take place. cms must also clarify how such quality reporting will satisfy mips quality reporting requirements for acos subject to mips.\n beneficiary notification requirements key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos disagrees with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assumption that the current beneficiary notification process is underutilized, and we urge cms to maintain the current beneficiary notification process. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we recommend cms instead simplify marketing requirements to allow acos the flexibility to communicate more effectively with patients about the program.\n proposals: cms proposes to modify the current beneficiary notification requirements and instead would require a standard written notification be provided annually to medicare ffs beneficiaries at their first primary care visit of the performance year in the form and manner specified by cms. beginning july 1, 2019, the aco would also be required, as part of the beneficiary notification process, to inform the patient about the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to, and the process by which, he or she may identify or change identification of a primary care provider for purposes of voluntary alignment. under this proposal, an aco participant would be required to provide this notice during a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first primary care visit in the six-month performance year from july 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019, as well as the first primary care visit in the 12-month performance year that begins on january 1, 2020 and in all subsequent performance years. this notice would be in addition to the existing requirement that an aco participant must post signs in its facilities and make standardized written notices available upon request. comments: naacos recommends cms maintain current beneficiary notification requirements. cms previously implemented and later removed a requirement to provide a written annual beneficiary notification. cms made this change in response to confusion among beneficiaries and based on comments from acos the notification requirement was too burdensome. specifically, cms revised the requirement so that aco providers/suppliers must post signs in their facilities and by make the notice available to beneficiaries upon request. cms notes the agency is revisiting the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing requirement to ensure beneficiaries have a sufficient opportunity to be informed about the program and how it may affect their care and data. cms also notes concern that the existing information on the program is provided to patients in separate resources, which may be time consuming for beneficiaries to compile and may be underutilized.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n burdens on acos by proposing acos use a template notification provided by cms, naacos notes that previously cms provided template language that was confusing to patients. this confusion prompted numerous calls and questions, and it distracted clinicians from proving patient care. as a more effective alternative, we recommend cms maintain current beneficiary notification requirements and allow acos increased flexibility to communicate with patients about the program using methods, such as including language on the aco websites as well as phone- recorded messages. currently, aco communication to beneficiaries is limited due to unnecessary marketing requirements preventing communication with a patient. these requirements inhibit an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to explain the benefits and services provided by acos. cms must allow acos to invest resources in the ways the organization finds most effective. this requirement is unnecessary and therefore a drain on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s limited resources. therefore, naacos urges cms to not finalize its proposals and instead focus on simplifying aco marketing requirements to provide acos with more flexibility in communicating effectively with the patients and community they serve.\n beneficiary assignment changes\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports the proposal to modify the definition of primary care services to include additional services if finalized as proposed in the 2019 medicare physician fee schedule (mpfs) proposed rule. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos strongly supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to provide acos with more flexibility in selecting a prospective or retrospective assignment methodology on an annual basis, and we urge cms to finalize this proposal. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms to reconsider its proposal to include specialists in the voluntary alignment process when a beneficiary elects such a professional as their primary care clinician, if the beneficiary does not receive primary care services from an aco professional in the aco. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos opposes cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed introduction of a new optional assignment method, the beneficiary opt- in assignment methodology, and instead we urge cms to improve upon the current voluntary alignment process by creating an automated system to support this assignment methodology.\n proposals: cms proposes to revise the definition of primary care services to include the following healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) and current procedural terminology (cpt) codes: (1) advance care planning service codes, cpt codes 99497 and 99498; (2) administration of health risk assessment service codes, cpt codes 96160 and 96161; (3) prolonged evaluation and management or psychotherapy service(s) beyond the typical service time of the primary procedure, cpt codes 99354 and 99355; (4) annual depression screening service code, hcpcs code g0444; (5) alcohol misuse screening service code, hcpcs code g0442; and (6) alcohol misuse counseling service code, hcpcs code g0443. in addition, if finalized as proposed in the 2019 mpfs proposed rule, cms would add these three new hcpcs codes to the mssp assignment methodology: (1) gpc1x add-on code, for the visit complexity inherent to evaluation and management associated with certain primary care services; (2) gcg0x add-on code, for visit complexity inherent to evaluation and management associated with endocrinology, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, urology, neurology, obstetrics/gynecology, allergy/immunology, otolaryngology, or interventional pain management-centered care; and (3) gpro1, an additional add-on code for prolonged evaluation and management or psychotherapy services beyond the typical service time of the primary procedure.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n program-wide. cms also clarifies that this proposal would have no effect on the voluntary alignment process that exists currently.\n additionally, cms proposes to provide more flexibility in choosing prospective or retrospective assignment for basic and enhanced acos, as required by the bipartisan budget act (bba). specifically, for acos entering agreement periods beginning on july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years, cms proposes to allow acos annually to elect the beneficiary assignment methodology (i.e., preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation or prospective assignment) to apply for each remaining performance year within their agreement period. cms also proposes to provide an opportunity for acos to switch their selection of beneficiary assignment methodology on an annual basis, which would be done prior to the start of a new performance year.\n finally, as required by the bba, cms proposes adjustments to the voluntary alignment process. cms proposes to modify current policies to assign a beneficiary to an aco based upon his or her selection of any aco professional, regardless of specialty, as his or her primary clinician. under this proposal, a beneficiary may select a practitioner with any specialty designation as his or her primary care provider and be eligible for voluntary alignment assignment to the aco in which the practitioner is an aco professional. currently the aco professional designated by the beneficiary must be a primary care physician as defined at \u00e2\u00a7425.20, a physician with a specialty designation included at \u00e2\u00a7425.402(c), or a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist. cms proposes to use a beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designation to align the beneficiary to the aco in which his or her primary clinician participates even if the beneficiary does not receive primary care services from an aco professional in that aco. cms proposes that the agency will not assign a beneficiary to the aco when the beneficiary is also eligible for assignment to an entity participating in a model tested or expanded under section 1115a of the act under which claims-based assignment is based solely on claims for services other than primary care services and for which there has been a determination by secretary that a waiver is necessary solely for purposes of testing the model.\n comments: naacos supports the proposal to modify the definition of primary care services to include additional services if finalized as proposed in the 2019 mpfs proposed rule. assignment is a critical program methodology that determines the beneficiary population for which an aco is held accountable. cms should continue to refine the primary care codes used in assignment to ensure the list used for acos is consistent with current billing practices. naacos also strongly supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to provide acos with more flexibility in selecting a prospective or retrospective assignment methodology on an annual basis, and we urge cms to finalize this proposal. naacos has long advocated for cms to provide acos with this much needed flexibility, and we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal.\n naacos has concerns with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals to modify the voluntary alignment process to include specialists in the voluntary assignment process if the beneficiary elects such a professional as his/her primary clinician. specifically, we have concerns regarding unintended consequences of this policy, and we request cms not to finalize this proposal. we recommend at a minimum if cms finalizes its proposal to include specialists in the voluntary alignment process it use an approach that overrides the existing claims-based assignment methodology only when a beneficiary has at least one qualified primary care service (based on the existing services used for mssp assignment) during the previous or current performance year with an aco professional as defined under step 1 or step 2 of mssp assignment.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n\n altering the attribution process to require beneficiaries to actively elect an aco would create insurmountable administrative complexities and would be confusing to beneficiaries. one of the unique aspects of the aco program is that the organization cares for all patients in the same manner, not knowing who will ultimately be attributed to the aco for the purposes of program calculations to determine quality and cost metrics for the aco. this results in acos treating all patients as potentially included in their aco and results in high quality, coordinated care for all beneficiaries. the current voluntary patient alignment option launched in 2017 has been underutilized and creates confusion among beneficiaries. we urge cms not to finalize the new beneficiary opt-in approach and continue to make any patient alignment options voluntary.\n naacos has long advocated for cms to incorporate voluntary alignment, and we were pleased that cms finalized its decision to do so in the final 2017 mpfs. however, as this option was only introduced beginning with performance year 2018, there are several areas cms must improve on to increase use of the option by beneficiaries. the functionality to designate a primary clinician was added to the mymedicare.gov website in june 2017. if a beneficiary has existing favorite clinicians from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy health\u00e2\u0080\u009d web page on mymedicare.gov, he or she can select \u00e2\u0080\u009cadd as my primary clinician.\u00e2\u0080\u009d if a beneficiary does not have a mymedicare.gov account, one must be created. beneficiaries can receive assistance with mymedicare.gov, including help to set up an account and/or designate a primary clinician by calling 1-800-medicare (1-800-633-4227). the my medicare help page notes that a primary clinician is the healthcare provider that a beneficiary believes is responsible for coordinating his or her overall care. once a beneficiary aligns to a qualifying clinician in an aco, he or she will be assigned to that aco until he or she removes the clinician as primary practitioner or he or she no longer meets the beneficiary eligibility assignment requirements or the requirements necessary for voluntary alignment. this process can be cumbersome and time consuming for beneficiaries unfamiliar with cms website. we recommend cms modify the voluntary alignment process by allowing beneficiaries to make this designation over the phone by calling the 1-800-medicare or through the physician compare website. we also request cms include more information in beneficiary communications about the importance of this designation and the role acos play in providing high quality, coordinated and efficient care. we urge cms to implement these changes and to consult with acos as the agency works to further improve the voluntary alignment process.\n payment rule waivers\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to finalize its proposal to expand eligibility for the skilled nursing facility (snf) three- day rule waiver to include acos participating in a two-sided model under preliminary prospective assignment. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms to finalize the proposal to include snf services furnished under swing bed arrangements, as this proposal addresses concerns of acos in rural areas that have fewer available snfs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand certain telehealth waivers to treat the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home as an originating site and not apply the originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services furnished by a practitioner participating in two-sided aco models. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms to implement proposed telehealth waiver changes effective july 1, 2019, consistent with the proposals for the expansion of the snf waiver, to increase access and use of the waiver by acos. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to consider adding other critical patient engagement tools for acos, such as allowing npi-level participation, permitting acos to establish post-acute care networks, providing acos with upfront funding for transportation services, waiving certain post-discharge home visit supervision requirements to allow for broader use of these services by acos when clinically appropriate and afford all acos with the ability to provide waived co-payments for primary care services provided by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s providers to encourage patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use of these services.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n for quarters 1, 2, and 3 of the performance year for snf services provided after the beneficiary first appeared on one of the assignment lists for the applicable performance year. cms also clarifies that, for purposes of determining eligibility to partner with an aco for the snf three-day rule waiver, snfs include providers furnishing snf services under swing bed arrangements. in these instances, the three-star quality rating requirement would be waived.\n cms also proposes beginning with performance years 2020 and beyond, the agency would treat the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home as an originating site and not apply the originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services furnished by a physician or practitioner participating in an applicable aco. cms proposes to apply these policies to acos under a two-sided model that participate under the prospective assignment method, not a preliminary prospective assignment method.\n comments: naacos strongly supports cms proposals to expand access to certain payment rule waivers for acos participating in performance-based risk models. these tools serve as critical patient engagement tools necessary for success. we urge cms to finalize its proposal to expand eligibility for the snf three-day rule waiver to include acos participating in a two-sided model under preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation. we also appreciate the proposal to include snf services furnished under swing bed arrangements, as this proposal addresses concerns of acos in rural areas that have fewer available snfs. while we support these changes, we also urge cms to streamline the current snf waiver process that is burdensome and therefore results in fewer acos using the waiver. specifically, we recommend cms alter the current requirements that the patient has been evaluated and approved for admission to the snf within three days prior to the snf admission by an aco provider/supplier that is a physician, consistent with the aco's beneficiary evaluation and admission plan. instead, we urge cms to also allow other qualified healthcare professionals to evaluate the patient and approve the admission to the snf. requiring a physician to see the patient is arbitrary and results in unnecessary delays that do not improve the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care. further, snf affiliates must have and maintain an overall rating of three stars or higher under the cms five-star quality rating system. as a result, acos must currently continually look up a snf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality rating which is time consuming and adds significant burden. under the bundled payments for care improvement advanced (bpci-a) program, cms provides by email an xls file to participants with a list of snfs that are approved by cms to participate in the three-day rule waiver available in bpci-a. we recommend cms take a similar approach with acos to minimize burden associated with the current process.\n naacos also supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand certain telehealth waivers to treat the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home as an originating site and not apply the originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services furnished by a practitioner participating in two-sided aco models. however, we urge cms to implement such proposal effective july 1, 2019, consistent with the proposals for the expansion of the snf waiver, to increase access and use of the waiver by acos. acos consider telehealth a crucial tool for improving care coordination and reducing costs. in addition to these waivers, we urge cms to consider adding other critical patient engagement tools for acos, as detailed below.\n allowing npi-level participation/network management\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n manage patient care as a team, and the aco would communicate with these providers about the cost and quality implications of their care decisions\n allowing acos to establish post-acute care networks\n cms does not currently allow acos to encourage patients to seek care from providers the aco has identified as most efficient and high quality. unlike ma program, acos are unable to provide incentives for beneficiary engagement with the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most efficient providers. this in turn creates challenges for the aco in communicating with beneficiaries regarding their preferred providers for treatment. these are the providers engaged with the aco and focused on providing coordinated, high quality care. naacos recommends cms allow acos the same opportunities that are currently provided to ma plans to increase beneficiary engagement through incentives for beneficiaries choosing high quality, efficient providers that work collaboratively with the aco, particularly for post-acute care providers to ensure aco patients receive the highest quality care. in order to facilitate this request, cms must also provide more transparency around post-acute care admissions and quality metrics for post-acute care providers.\n providing acos upfront funding for transportation services\n lack of transportation is often cited as a barrier to healthcare access and can lead to missed appointments, delayed care, and ultimately poorer health outcomes. this issue is especially important for effectively managing patients with chronic diseases, who require more appointments and timely healthcare interventions as well as ongoing medication management. a literature review of research on this issue found that patients with a lower socioeconomic status had higher rates of transportation barriers to ongoing healthcare access than those with a higher socioeconomic status. this is a critical issue that, if addressed, could help to improve health outcomes, particularly for the patients that most need ongoing care. therefore, we recommend cms provide funding for acos to deliver transportation services to allow beneficiaries to seek the treatment they need. this could be provided as an upfront payment or as a defined member benefit. the transportation benefit could be billed by the healthcare provider, for example, providing eight trips for the patient and thereby giving transportation to and from the office for four visits for the patient. other payers currently utilize this approach, such as humana and providence health plan, and could be used as models.\n post-discharge home visits and primary care co-payments\n additionally, we urge cms to waive certain post-discharge home visit supervision requirements to allow for broader use of these services by acos when clinically appropriate. we ask that cms allow physicians to contract with licensed clinicians to provide these home visit services using general instead of direct supervision requirements specified at 42 cfr \u00e2\u00a7 410.32(b)(3). this will provide all acos with needed flexibility during the critical post-discharge time period. finally, we ask cms to afford all acos with the ability to provide waived co-payments for primary care services provided by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s providers to encourage patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use of these critical services. cms should afford all acos with every opportunity for success in reducing costs for their patients by allowing acos to use these high-value services, and we request that these waivers apply to all acos participating in performance-based risk models.\n providing acos upfront funding for social services\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900

(aim) program, providing targeted advanced loan payments to acos to provide such services.\n beneficiary incentive program\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a beneficiary incentive program for certain acos. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms provide the necessary funding for the beneficiary incentive program, as is done in the next generation aco program.\n proposals: cms proposes to allow any aco in track 2, levels c, d, or e of the basic track, or the enhanced track to establish a cms-approved beneficiary incentive program to provide incentive payments to eligible beneficiaries who receive qualifying services. as required by the bba, cms proposes a $20 payment limit, updated annually consistent with the consumer price index and rounded to the nearest dollar, and made no later than 30 days after the service. a beneficiary would be eligible to receive an incentive payment if the beneficiary is assigned to an aco through either preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation or prospective assignment.\n cms proposes the aco legal entity, not any participant providers or suppliers, must furnish the incentive directly to the beneficiary and that incentives must not be cash but may be cash equivalent (e.g., check or debit card). incentives must be non-medicare covered items and services, and acos must keep records of all incentive payments. cms proposes that acos must fully fund the costs of operating the beneficiary incentive program, including the cost of any incentive payments. acos are prohibited from accepting or using funds furnished by an outside entity, including, but not limited to, an insurance company, pharmaceutical company, or any other entity outside of the aco, to finance its beneficiary incentive program.\n cms proposes that incentive payments made by an aco shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating benchmarks, estimated average per capita medicare expenditures, and shared savings. cms also proposes to disregard incentive payments made by an aco for purposes of calculating shared losses. lastly, cms proposes a requirement that acos publicly report for each performance year the total number of beneficiaries who receive an incentive payment, the total number of incentive payments furnished, hcpcs codes associated with any qualifying payment for which an incentive payment was furnished, the total value of all incentive payments furnished, and the total type of each incentive payment (e.g., check or debit card) furnished.\n comments: naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to introduce a beneficiary incentive program for certain acos. as discussed above, such patient engagement tools are critical to an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to better manage a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care. while we support this proposal, we have concerns with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to implementation, which would require the aco fully fund the costs of such a program. there are numerous upfront costs required to establish and maintain an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations. acos invest these dollars to support the model and efforts to transform patient care, sometimes never realizing these investment costs. those acos that do earn shared savings do not see such funds until years after the upfront investments have been made. therefore, it is unreasonable to expect the aco to fully fund the costs of such a program, and we urge cms instead provide such funding as is the case in the next generation aco program. at a minimum, cms should consider funding the program for the first year to support the cost of running such a program.\n quality changes\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900

not be required to report promoting interoperability (pi) and would instead see pi performance category weights redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative and asks that cms consider not only whether a measure is a process measure, but also whether the measure is considered a low-value process measure, before removing from aco quality measure sets. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to consider the addition of opioid use measures for potential inclusion in aco quality measure sets in future program years, and we recommend certain changes to such measures as detailed below. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we urge cms to exclude mips bonuses from aco expenditures.\n proposals: cms proposes to discontinue use of the quality measure 11 that assesses an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligible clinicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 level of adoption of cehrt. instead, cms proposes that for performance years starting on january 1, 2019 and subsequent performance years, acos in a track or a payment model within a track, which does not meet the financial risk standard to be an advanced apm, must attest and certify upon application to participate in the mssp and subsequently as part of the annual certification process that at least 50 percent of the eligible clinicians participating in the aco use cehrt to document and communicate clinical care to their patients or other health care providers. acos would be required to submit this certification in the form and manner specified by cms.\n cms also seeks feedback on ways to reduce burden and focus on meaningful quality measures as part of their meaningful measures initiative. under this initiative, cms states it is working towards assessing performance on only those core issues that are most vital to providing high-quality care and improving patient outcomes with an emphasis on outcome-based measures, reducing unnecessary burden on providers, and putting patients first.\n finally, cms is also considering the addition of one or more measures specific to opioid use to the aco quality measures set. the potential benefits of such policies would be to focus acos on the appropriate use of opioids for their assigned beneficiaries and support their opioid misuse prevention efforts. specifically, cms is considering the following relevant national quality forum (nqf)-endorsed measures with emphasis on medicare individuals with part d coverage who are 18 years or older without cancer or enrolled in hospice: nqf 2940, use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer; nqf 2950, use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer; nqf 2951, use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer.\n comments: naacos strongly supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to remove aco measure 11 and instead rely on attestation to evaluate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of cehrt. we appreciate cms responding to naacos requests to remove this measure and as a result rely on attestations as is done in the next generation aco model. we ask cms to clarify that acos subject to mips would not be required to report pi and would instead see pi performance category weights redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories. we agree that removal of this measure will reduce significant regulatory burdens; acos subject to mips (basic track levels a through d as proposed) should not be unfairly excluded from this policy. all acos demonstrate a commitment to use of ehrs, including acos in models not categorized as advanced apms. we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful measures initiative and, in this role, we feel cms must also look to reduce the regulatory burden on acos to comply with mips requirements to the fullest extent possible. this includes making all program criteria and scoring methodologies for acos specifically accessible and transparent.\n as cms looks to future quality measure changes for acos, we urge the agency to consider not only whether a measure is considered a process measure but also what relative value the measure provides, when considering the burden associated with data collection and reporting of the measure. further, as cms considers annual measure changes, we note that each measure change results in administrative costs, such as changing work flows and ehrs for data collection and reporting.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n measurement and use of clinical practice guidelines to ensure patients have access to safer, more effective chronic pain treatment while reducing the number of people who misuse, abuse, or overdose from these drugs. cms specifically considers the following nqf-endorsed measures with emphasis on medicare individuals with part d coverage who are 18 years or older without cancer or enrolled in hospice: nqf 2940, use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer; nqf 2950, use of opioids from multiple providers in persons without cancer; nqf 2951, use of opioids from multiple providers and at high dosage in persons without cancer. we recommend changes to nqf 2940; this measure should instead align with the centers for disease control and prevention guidelines identifying patients for whom opioid prescriptions exceed 90 morphine milligram equivalents. it is important to include these measures on dose and duration of opioids prescribed. however, we urge cms to initially make such measures pay-for-reporting only as the measures are further refined with stakeholder input for use in the aco program.\n finally, we urge cms to exclude mips bonuses as aco expenditures. the current cms policy unfairly punishes acos for their high performance by both requiring track 1 acos (and basic levels a, b, c and d as proposed) to participate in mips, excluding such acos from advanced apm bonuses and counting any mips bonuses earned for high performance in that program as aco expenditures. cms currently excludes advanced apm bonuses from aco expenditures and we reiterate our request for cms do the same for mips expenditures. this will be increasingly important over time as mips bonuses are projected to rise in future program years. while aggregate program data has not yet been made available by cms, many acos have already reported perfect or nearly perfect scores in mips for 2017. these bonuses will then count against the aco when expenditures are calculated for purposes of mssp calculations. therefore, the better an aco and its eligible clinicians perform in mips, the greater they will be penalized when calculating shared savings/losses for the aco. this is an unfair and untenable policy. although cms argues that the agency has maintained this policy under the value-based payment modifier program, naacos believes cms has the authority and ability to remove mips expenditures from aco benchmark calculations. in fact, cms does make claim-level adjustments by adding sequestration costs back to paid amounts when calculating aco expenditures. it was not the intent of congress to penalize acos in mips, and therefore cms must alter this policy.\n repayment mechanisms\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to remove the requirement for tail period coverage and to lower the repayment mechanism amounts for basic track levels c, d and e. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand the acceptable institutions providing a repayment mechanism to include any insured institution, including credit unions. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos supports using the most recent data available to establish a repayment mechanism amount, requests cms increase the threshold that would trigger a higher repayment mechanism amount and provide symmetry by allowing decreases in repayment mechanism amounts during an agreement period. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos requests that cms provide new repayment mechanisms, including reinstating reinsurance and introducing an option for a future withhold of medicare payments.\n proposals: as with current risk-based models, acos in the revised mssp would be required to demonstrate their ability to repay losses by establishing a sufficient repayment mechanism, including funds placed in escrow, a letter of credit, a surety bond, or a combination of those mechanisms. the agency proposes to expand the acceptable institutions providing a repayment mechanism to include any insured institution, including credit unions. the agency also proposes to extend the duration of the repayment mechanism, which would need to be in place for the number of risk-based years in the agreement period plus an additional 24 months of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctail coverage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms proposes to use the most recent calendar year having 12 months of available data to establish the repayment mechanism amount.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n amount equal to 1 percent of total assigned beneficiary expenditures (benchmark-based standard). the agency notes its efforts to minimize administrative burdens by proposing that acos with a repayment mechanism would be permitted to extend its duration for the basic or enhanced tracks. in the event that any of the following occur, cms proposes that the repayment mechanism may be terminated.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 shared losses have been fully repaid for all performance years. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms has exhausted the amount. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms determines that shared losses are not owed.\n comments: securing a repayment mechanism is a regulatory burden, which is time consuming and costly for acos. many acos cite the burden and cost of securing a repayment mechanism as reasons not to move to a risk-based aco model. instead of requiring a repayment mechanism that pays banks and brokers and takes money away from the aco executing its core mission of improving patient care, we urge cms to remove the repayment mechanism requirement when an aco can prove that it has an investor or financial backer with a demonstrated high credit rating. financial backers could include outside investors, insurers or hospitals or health systems that are involved with the aco and providing financial support, which would be available should losses occur. this assurance would protect the medicare trust fund in the event the aco has losses while avoiding the financial inefficiency and regulatory burden of involving outside financial institutions as third parties that benefit from the repayment mechanism requirements. this would also eliminate the need to have a 24-month tail period.\n the additional burden of a 24-month \u00e2\u0080\u009ctail period\u00e2\u0080\u009d heightens concerns and increases financial requirements for acos. should cms maintain requirements for a repayment mechanism, we request the agency to minimize this regulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for tail period coverage, which is especially important considering the longer agreement periods cms proposes. should the agency retain a tail period, we also urge the agency to ensure that cms is equally liable to pay for additional shared savings if discovered up to 24 months following the agreement period and this should be noted in the mssp participation agreements.\n we further recommend cms reduce the repayment mechanism requirements, especially for the lower risk basic track levels c, d and e. for these levels, cms should only require a guarantee equal to 0.5 percent of total benchmark expenditures or 1 percent of ffs revenue.  those amounts are sufficient to prompt third-party due diligence and establish credit worthiness within the probable range of shared losses. this reduction makes sense especially in light of the 30 percent loss sharing rate in these levels that correspondingly reduces the likelihood of net losses.\n we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to expand the acceptable institutions providing a repayment mechanism to include any insured institution, including credit unions. this would provide more options than the current requirement to only utilize federal deposit insurance corporation-insured institutions. allowing access to credit unions may provide more economical alternatives and increase market competition, which could potentially lower the overall cost of accessing repayment mechanisms. we recommend cms finalize this expansion of acceptable institutions as proposed.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n time. for example, we request the agency work with acos to provide flexibility to release funds for a limited window, such as 60 days, for acos changing repayment mechanisms. updating repayment mechanisms may happen over time as a result of organizational changes, needs, and availability of specific repayment mechanisms.\n we also request that cms provide new repayment mechanisms, including reinstating reinsurance and introducing an option for a future withhold of medicare payments as repayment mechanisms. we request cms restore reinsurance as a qualifying repayment mechanism, which it was until cms removed it in the june 2015 final mssp rule. the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rationale for doing so was that few acos were using this option. however, we question that logic considering how few risk-bearing acos there were at that time. further, despite limited initial use of reinsurance for demonstrating ability to repay losses to cms, this continues to be an option which some acos pursue separate from their cms obligations. therefore, we see no harm in cms reinstating reinsurance as an option, and we urge cms to do so for all two-sided aco tracks/models.\n under the macra financial risk standards, the agency may allow a reduction of payment rates to the apm entity and/or the apm entity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligible clinicians as one option for repaying losses. we urge cms to develop an option for acos to repay losses through reduced payment rates of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligible clinicians in future years. through this mechanism, cms would identify the tin/ npi combinations that participate in the aco for a specific performance period and, similar to downward payment adjustments under mips, cms would reduce the payment rates for those tin/npis by a certain percent in a future payment adjustment year to recoup the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s losses. acos would include language in the agreement between the aco and its participant tins and their individual practitioners detailing specifics of this repayment mechanism. allowing acos to choose this as one of the mechanisms to repay losses would provide a new option that some acos may prefer over repaying losses in a lump sum. we urge cms to work collaboratively with us to further develop this concept and the key details that would be needed to implement it.\n extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy\n key comments: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 naacos urges cms to revise the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy to provide a trend/growth rate that is the higher of the national assignable rate or the regional rate. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 we strongly recommend cms award a quality score that is the greater of the quality score earned in the performance year affected by the extreme circumstance, the prior year quality score, or the national mean quality score. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 cms should consider introducing ways to more accurately account for impact of natural disasters, for example, identifying ways to identify natural disaster related impact at the beneficiary and claims level through the use of modifiers that account for unsafe place of discharge which could be added to claims after the impact of a natural disaster.\n proposal: cms previously established policies beginning with performance year 2017 and every year that follows, for using an alternative approach to calculate acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cost and quality performance if deemed affected by an \u00e2\u0080\u009cextreme and uncontrollable circumstance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cms seeks feedback on this policy.\n comments: we appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughtful analysis and proposals related to accounting for the impact of a natural disaster on an impacted aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shared losses and quality. cms proposes a more aggressive transition to risk. therefore, these policies are even more critical to protect acos unfairly harmed by expenses and quality changes beyond their control as a result of a natural disaster. as acos have been impacted by several natural disasters in recent years, more data are available to deeply analyze the effect of such extreme and uncontrollable circumstances on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n introducing such policies, acos have had more experiences with natural disasters and therefore experience with how such events affect an aco. based on this experience, we recommend several changes to the current extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy.\n trend rate without changes to the current policy, natural disasters will negatively affect mssp acos and therefore affect the long-term sustainability of the program and the medicare trust fund. the current policy prorates shared losses by multiplying the shared losses by two factors: the percentage of the total months in the performance year affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance and the beneficiaries who reside in an area affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance. this adequately addresses acos that are expected to have shared losses based on performance prior to a natural disaster and have increased shared losses after a natural disaster. however, the current policy does not address an increase in annual per capital expense as compared to the benchmark/msr/mlr. this point is particularly sensitive around msr and mlr values where very small changes can have large or 100 percent impact on shared savings or shared losses when either the msr or mlr is exceeded.\n the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current policy relies on \u00e2\u0080\u009cuse of natural disaster payment modifiers\u00e2\u0080\u009d to allow mssp acos to identify whether a claim would have been denied under normal medicare ffs rules. there is no evidence to support that part a providers were or are aware of such natural disaster codes or were using them compliantly. additionally, there is no policy to use them to account for unsafe place of discharge which creates a longer length of stay. we believe that there is a current disparity between cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectation of compliance with disaster payment modifiers and the current use of such codes (see additional comments below regarding use of natural disaster codes). due to these limitations of the current policy, we instead recommend that cms revise the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy to provide a trend/growth rate that is the higher of the national assignable rate or the regional rate. further, the regional rate should be calculated by excluding the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiaries. studies have shown that natural disaster materially increase medicare costs per beneficiary. for example a recent article, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisaster impacts on cost and utilization of medicare\u00e2\u0080\u009d shows annual standardized cost per beneficiary increased\n7.6% from the mean in the counties most severely impacted by these events (see table 1).  \n\n quality performance scores natural disasters can have a significant negative impact on both aco process and outcomes measure scores. as an example, for process measures it is not uncommon during a disaster for scheduled annual wellness visits to be canceled due either to clinic closure or beneficiary evacuation. in some instances, these visits aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t subsequently rescheduled which leads to missed opportunities to provide preventative care and identify emerging issues that require care coordination. the current cms policy awards an average quality score to those affected by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, which can unfairly penalize high performing acos. instead we recommend cms should use an approach similar to the policy currently used in the ma program and award a quality score that is the greater of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality score for the affected performance year, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prior year quality score, or the national mean quality score. for acos that are in their first year, cms should award a quality score that is the greater of their actual quality score for the affected performance year or the national mean quality score. we also strongly recommend cms expand its policy related to aco quality scores negatively affected by a natural disaster to include all acos, not just those who cannot report quality data. we believe that acos whose scores on either the all-cause readmissions measure (aco-8) or the snf readmissions measure (aco-35) fall below the 30th percentile should be eligible to have their quality score adjusted to account for the natural disaster.\n\n 601 13th street, nw, suite 900 south, washington, dc 20005  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  202-640-1895  \u00ef\u0081\u00ac  info@naacos.com\nwww.naacos.com \n\n additionally, the codes do not allow for capturing instances of \u00e2\u0080\u0098unsafe place of discharge\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which is common during a natural disaster. furthermore, the timing of the claims submission during a natural disaster does not lend itself to accurate use of the modifiers. at the time of an extreme event or natural disaster, a facility is working tirelessly to address the patient surge, to transfer patients who have clinical needs that cannot be met under emergency operating conditions, and to meet a myriad of other community needs. training health system providers to use these codes is not common. given the infrequent nature of these events providers focus their scarce training resources for revenue cycle staff to remain in compliance with medicare and medicaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever-evolving billing regulations. therefore, at a time when providers are pushed beyond capacity to manage patient care during emergencies, there is no routine revenue cycle workflow to ensure the disaster modifiers are accurately assigned. only in instances where a biller knows a claim is out of compliance for payment may the workflow to add the code be triggered. therefore, we feel the definition of these modifiers must be expanded or new natural disaster payment modifiers should be created with proper education to help isolate the extreme or uncontrollable events by claim or beneficiary during a natural disaster. naacos feels this would be a more accurate approach to analyzing impacts of extreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster.\n conclusion\n acos have been instrumental in the shift to value-based care and a central part of the aco concept is to transform healthcare through meaningful clinical and operational changes to put patients first by improving their care and reducing unnecessary expenditures. the mssp remains a voluntary program, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to have the right balance of risk and reward to continue program growth and success. program changes that deter new entrants would shut off a pipeline of beginner acos that should be encouraged to embark on the journey to value, which is a long- standing bipartisan goal of the administration and congress and important aspect of the qpp. we urge the agency to consider the feedback presented from the aco community outlined in this letter. thank you for your consideration of our comments.\n sincerely,\n\n\n", "0388": "october

160), august 17, 2018\n submitted electronically to: www.regulations.gov\n dear administrator verma,\n on behalf of memorialcare, a nonprofit, fully-integrated health care delivery system located in southern california that includes four hospitals with 11,000 employees and 2,550 medical staff physicians, we appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) proposed rule outlining changes to the medicare shared savings program (mssp).\n background: memorialcare is an advocate of value-based care and has continued to increase the number and variety of value-based contracts to multiple populations of patients. our medical group and independent physician association (ipa) have several decades of experience accepting capitated risk for the management of both medicare advantage (ma) and commercial hmo patients. more recently, we participated in the centers for medicare and medicaid innovation next generation accountable care organization (aco). in addition, we have experience in commercial acos, including several with aetna and anthem, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve added our newest offering in 2017, a direct-to-employer agreement for accountable care with the boeing company. our system has successfully approached these value- based delivery innovations through a unique collaborative effort with the physicians of our physician society, an association of over 1900 affiliated community primary care and specialist providers committed to evidence-based care, and our medical foundation (mcmf), which is affiliated with memorialcare medical group (mcmg) and greater newport physicians, a multi-specialty ipa. in addition, we have intentionally focused our expansion on medical offices and clinics, and outpatient access points, including ambulatory surgery centers, free-standing imaging facilities and dialysis centers.  memorialcare looks forward to continuing these efforts as health care steadily moves to improve systems that reward value and outcomes.\n\n 2\n things to consider: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 please consider new payment models in the future, including the america\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physician groups proposed third option. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 provide more ramp up time for next generation aco participants. \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 expand access to the 3-day waiver for skilled-nursing facility and telehealth coverage under the mssp program\n\n new model: third option - proposed by apg: memorialcare supports apg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed \u00e2\u0080\u009cthird option\u00e2\u0080\u009d a new direct contract model that features capitated payments to physician organizations.  at the core of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cthird option\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the formation of physician-led, clinically integrated organizations (cios). a cio is made up of participating physician group practices that provide both primary and specialty care to patients in traditional medicare.  it features prospective population payments to physician organizations that include robust quality measurements with active beneficiary engagement.\n the model would allow cms to directly contract with cios. the cios may be existing physician organizations or newly formed entities. the cio would be explicitly physician group centric, however, other providers could take ownership stakes, or could accept a measure of risk and accountability through affiliation agreements.\n in order to participate in this model, cios would have to meet current cms and state requirements, similar to those required for existing medicare accountable care organization (aco) participants such as a formal legal structure that allows the organization to receive capitated payment and pay contracted or employed providers. while at the same time, the model provides for the active enrollment by beneficiaries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a design element critical to the goal of achieving the full beneficiary engagement.\n cms would establish capitation rates including the standard medicare part a and part b benefits, using methods and benchmarks similar to those used to establish rates for medicare advantage (ma) plans. the payments would be actuarially sound, risk adjusted, and updated annually. cms would pre-pay this amount to the cio each month in lieu of medicare part a and part b fee for service (ffs) payments for enrolled beneficiaries, and the cio would then be responsible for the payment for all professional and hospital services, whether provided in-network or out-of-network.\n beneficiaries would be encouraged to stay in network by differential copayments and coinsurance, paying higher copayments for going out of the cios contracted or employed network, and lower or no copayments for services received in-network. medicare supplement benefits would only be payable for services in network. in addition, there would be robust publicly reported quality and efficiency measures similar to the ma stars rating and could be used to make comparisons between the cios and\nffs.   \n\n 3\n cms would contract with one or more affiliated service organizations (asos) to provide a full range of necessary administrative services, including quality and data reporting, payment, financial and patient cost sharing tracking, enrollment, and all other back office functions. these asos would serve as fiscal and administrative intermediaries similar to those currently engaged by cms and by self-insured employers.\n the third option allows participating clinicians to better coordinate services and practice patient- centered medical care tailored to each individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s specific needs. the tools available in this new model not only keep costs in check but, more importantly, truly improve patient care and outcomes for our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seniors.\n memorialcare and next generation aco: we continue to advocate to issues we raised with the next generation aco model including attribution methodologies, stop loss and risk calculations. we met with cmmi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team several times in 2017 to review our concerns about the current modeling which adversely impacted our organization despite an overall positive performance on raw costs of care, and impacted a number of other programs in california.  based on these concerns, we did not reapply in 2018 to participate in the next generation aco.\n however, based on our experience we suggest program consideration should be given for allowing a \u00e2\u0080\u009cramp up\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a no-risk period (e.g. 6-12 months) and/or the option to extend the return of investment (roi) from 12 to 24 months.  this would enable the aco to have an effective period of time to establish coordinated care for all high and rising risk patients and to allow for beneficiary engagement and data/claims flow before risk-sharing begins.\n guiding principle: support removal of legal and regulatory barriers to clinical integration, as well as modifications and waivers to medicare policies that deny hospitals the flexibility to provide the most efficient and clinically appropriate care: memorialcare applauds the administration for the work to date under its patient over paperwork initiative and its active solicitation of stakeholder feedback in changes needed to both the stark and anti-kickback laws through two separate requests for information. we urge the agency to continue to find additional opportunities under the mssp program to remove unnecessary barriers in care delivery and in care transitions. both federal and california state law create serious barriers to clinical integration, which is essential to creating efficiencies and improving care under alternative payment models. clinical integration depends on hospitals, doctors, nurses and other caregivers working as a team to ensure that patients get the right care, at the right time, in the right place. shared savings and gainsharing provide important mechanisms for aligning providers' interests to decrease health care costs while improving quality, as the health care industry transitions from volume- to value-based payment.\n\n 4\n therefore, we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposals to expand access to the 3-day waiver for skilled-nursing facility and telehealth coverage under the mssp program. memorialcare urges cms to look for additional opportunities to further streamline care delivery for our beneficiaries. in california, state law poses a significant challenge to aligning incentives, therefore it is incredibly important to ensure federal flexibility. the cost of doing business is increased by the need for complex business agreements in order to appropriately navigate a complex regulatory framework. these costs should be avoided.\n thank you for the opportunity to provide comments.  if you have any questions, please feel free to

baltimore, md 21244\n\n 2\nwww.hcttf.org \n\ni. supporting sustainable delivery system transformation \n\n 3\nwww.hcttf.org \n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the measure of aco success should incorporate a formal program evaluation. there is much discussion about the most accurate way to measure individual mssp participant performance and overall program impact. cms analysis presented in the proposed rule also finds that mssp acos produce significant net savings when considering claims data beyond the benchmark, including spillover effects on related populations and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeedback effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d of wider aco participation in lowering ffs trend and subsequent benchmarks. several independent evaluations using cms data also indicate that the relative-to-benchmark method for evaluating program performance underestimates true savings to the medicare program. statistical analysis by harvard researchers used control groups to determine net savings to medicare from the mssp program in 2015 ($256.4 million) was nearly 2.8 times greater than the amount reported by cms using only benchmark comparisons ($92.3 million).1 while the aco benchmark methodology may be appropriate for policy purposes, for purposes of evaluating impact on the trust fund, it is important to incorporate a broader set of measurement approaches to determine overall impact on spending for non-aco assigned medicare ffs beneficiaries and medicare advantage expenditures. the propose rule seeks to improve the long-term success and sustainability of mssp by creating a pathway for acos to more rapidly transition to performance-based risk. the greatest potential savings to medicare will come from acos reducing claims-based medical cost. current data shows that these medical costs are being reduced in all types of acos, which is a positive trend. however, the greatest potential for program savings is likely to be achieved when more acos move to performance-based risk. thus, the program will only realize its maximum net savings potential if cms finalizes policy that encourages broad participation in this voluntary program and properly aligns incentives to inspire participants to advance along the risk continuum. we offer recommendations below to advance these important objectives.\nii. participation options \n the task force has long supported the creation of new two-sided risk models that would provide an intermediate step along the continuum to fully mature two-sided risk models for both hospital and physician-led acos. for this reason, we supported cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s track 1+ aco model to assist mssp track 1 acos in the transition to advanced apms. if structured appropriately, the new participation options could provide a desirable glide path to participation in models with higher levels of performance-based risk.\na. basic track glidepath \n the real potential of the aco program depends on both the breadth of participation as well as the financial incentives to control costs while improving quality of care. we are supportive of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intent to reduce the time allowed for acos to remain in upside-only payment arrangements, but we believe that upside-only payment arrangements serve an important function as a transitional state on the path to full-risk models that allow providers to become familiar with program requirements and managing risk.\n\n 4\nwww.hcttf.org \n as proposed, however, the basic track falls short of creating an attractive path for providers to voluntarily follow given the level of investment required to stand up and operate an aco. cms has proposed a maximum financial upside rate of 25 percent for the first two performance levels of the basic track, increasing to 30 percent, 40 percent, and 50 percent shared savings rates with increasing levels of risk. our provider members strongly believe that a 25 percent shared savings rate in the first two years will be a barrier to entry for new acos because the investment costs alone would outweigh any potential return. further, the task force has previously shared our perspective with cms that a 50 percent shared savings rate may not provide sufficient incentive for providers to take on higher levels of risk (given the challenges around predictability, transparency and simplicity of the financial model as described above) or to invest in the delivery reforms necessary to succeed in a performance-based risk model. the shared savings rates as proposed will be a major deterrent for keeping existing acos in the program and encouraging all participants to invest in practice transformation. therefore, we urge cms to set the entry-level shared savings rate for the basic track at 50 percent with higher shared savings rates for levels with performance-based risk. it is critical to create a feasible business case for new entrants to transition away from fee-for-service by setting a reasonable potential upside rate, while increasing the reward as risk increases. as noted in the next subsection, this step-up approach at these levels of shared savings also has the potential to create greater consistency for acos to move from the basic to the enhanced track.\nb. enhanced track glidepath \n as proposed, some acos would not be eligible to enter the basic track or to renew for a second agreement period, and would instead have the option of enrolling in the enhanced track. the difference in risk level from the basic level e to enhanced track is significant. cms should either build a glide path to the highest risk level within the enhanced track or offer an additional track to help bridge the gap. if cms finalizes the proposed distinct options for high-revenue versus low-revenue acos (discussed further below), we believe an enhanced glidepath could encourage more high-revenue acos to join the program that would otherwise drop out. to maximize interest in moving to the enhanced track, cms should start the shared savings rate in line with the shared savings rate for the next generation aco program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk arrangement a (80 percent).\nc. full track option \n\n 5\nwww.hcttf.org \n a number of next gen acos started their journey as track 1 mssp acos, which demonstrates the importance of cms creating a comprehensive glidepath to risk.\nd. differentiate participation options based on aco performance \n the proposed rule offers distinct participation options for new and renewing acos based on the broad categories of total part a and b ffs revenue and prior experience with performance-based risk. cms offers justification for this differentiation that high-revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which typically include a hospital \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are more capable of controlling the total expenditures of its assigned beneficiaries. this proposal would create unnecessary complexity and disincentive hospital-led aco participation. the hcttf does not support distinct participation options for high-revenue versus low-revenue acos as proposed. the objective of the medicare shared savings program is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients. the best way to drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including hospitals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to collaborate to innovate and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare. the task force recommends an alternate distinction based on actual aco performance over time. the 2017 mssp results confirm that aco performance improves with longer participation in the program. for acos inexperienced with risk, the early years of aco participation require significant investment in system change and a steep learning curve; the returns on that investment risk are realized over the lifetime of the aco, not necessarily the first or second year of the performance period. providing a longer window for successful acos to continue in the program and achieve a reasonable return on their investment will encourage broader upfront adoption, incentivize better performance, and encourage greater long-term returns by retaining high performers. therefore, cms should institute gatekeeping mechanisms to ensure that acos meeting set cost and quality goals can continue participation within an mssp track. the proposed rule already lays out a much more aggressive policy for early termination of acos with expenditures exceeding the minimum loss ratio for two years. we agree that acos that are unable to succeed under a risk-based arrangement should not be permitted to remain in the program. however, the task force encourages an extended observation period to assess aco performance for at least three years \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and consider improvements over time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 before limiting participation options. under the current reporting cycle timeline, acos are not informed of their performance until october of the following year. a critical component of performance improvement lies in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to analyze the performance data being provided to the aco and make targeted improvements based on this information. at least three performance years would be needed to collect two years of completed performance data on which to base that assessment. for current acos that have at least three years of participation experience, cms could use existing performance data to make a determination.\ne. mandatory progression \n\n 6\nwww.hcttf.org \n we do not support that proposal, we similarly believe that the mandatory progression proposal should not be finalized.\niii. benchmarking refinements \n\n\na. risk adjustment \n cms has proposed modifications to the risk adjustment methodology to account for changes in case mix and severity of assigned beneficiaries and to eliminate the distinction between continuously and newly aligned beneficiaries, which is a step in the right direction. however, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to cap the risk score growth at +/-3 percent seems arbitrary without supporting data. further, by capping the growth in risk scores for a defined attributed population, risk adjustment in performance benchmarks is not reflective of the population a provider is managing year to year. this discrepancy can contribute to adverse incentives for program participants and encourage cherry-picking. alternatively, cms should focus on bringing more consistency to the risk scoring approaches across medicare apms and medicare advantage.\nb. regional factors \n cms proposes to incorporate regional factors when establishing the benchmark as part of the first agreement period, as well as for updating the benchmark. we recommend that cms maintain the cap on the regional adjustment at 70% percent. we also encourage cms to remove aco beneficiaries from the regional comparison group; including aco beneficiaries in the comparison defeats the purpose of accounting for non-aco regional expenditure trend.  these changes will help create a stronger business investment case within a financial model that is often complex, opaque and unpredictable.\niv. program policies \n the task force is generally supportive of the refined program policies as proposed, including the additional certainty and predictability provided by 5-year agreement periods; annual participation elections for retrospective or prospective beneficiary alignment; enhanced beneficiary engagement options; and expanded access for all two-sided acos to payment rule waivers. we recommend cms consider modifications to the following policies as proposed.\na. offer 12-month extension to current acos \n cms should allow existing acos that would be qualified for the 6-month extension to instead extend for a full year. prorating the performance period benchmark would introduce numerous complications for measuring performance. for example, medicare expenditures demonstrate strong and well-known seasonality which would skew performance results when comparing performance from the first six months of the calendar year against a prorated benchmark which represents an annual average. also, the change in beneficiary assignment methodology mid-year could present issues related to managing two different populations.\nb. beneficiary assignment methodology \n\n 7\nwww.hcttf.org \n assignment to those who choose to opt-in, or those who are chronically ill.  we are very concerned that the seven claims per year threshold is too low and would leave out a large portion of medicare beneficiaries from the program. we encourage cms focus on implementing the new voluntary alignment provisions this year and further research the implications of such a hybrid approach before implementing.\nc. early termination  \n as noted above, the task force supports the proposal to allow cms to terminate an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement immediately or with advanced notice if the aco is negatively outside the mlr corridor, but recommend cms extend the period of review to 3 performance years as well as consider evidence of improvement over time before making a determination to terminate an aco.\nd. overlap with other apms including cpc+ \n various alternative payment models \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including population-based payment models, episodes of care, and advanced primary care models \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when deployed in coordination can have a positive synergistic impact on care for medicare beneficiaries. the hcttf has offered cms recommendations for providing apm participants adequate flexibility to manage model overlap based on their unique market situation in a way that encourages greater alignment and ultimately drives better outcomes for patients.2 it is therefore notable that the proposed rule does not address the longstanding policy for comprehensive primary care plus (cpc+) practices participating in acos. the cpc+ model meets a critical gap in advanced primary care payment models, which incorporates care management fees and performance-based incentive payments. the new care management fees are accounted for as aco expenditures but are not accounted for in the historical cost base for an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark for five years, which harms the acos participating in transforming primary care practices. cms should discount the cpc+ care management fees from aco benchmarks to encourage primary care investment and coordination with acos, until those costs are fully incorporated into the baseline and therefore the benchmark.\ne. waiver applicability \n through existing waivers, aco participants have been able to better meet the needs of individual patients in a variety of innovative ways. however, providers are understandably cautious to utilize waivers when applicability is unclear. our members report uncertainty around the availability of particular waivers due to limited commentary about cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intended scope or applicability for particular aco participants. given that waivers are currently available on an opt-in basis, this uncertainty has led some stakeholders to decline the opportunity out of fear of noncompliance if they implement a waiver incorrectly. with the expanded availability of waivers under the proposed rule, we urge cms to expedite and regularly update frequently asked questions guidance documents and/or commentaries in response to recurrent questions regarding common provider circumstances. cms and the office of the inspector general should also explore mechanisms for providers to ask questions for guidance about the waivers short of a traditional advisory opinion.

submitted electronically to www.regulations.gov re: cms-1701-p dear administrator verma:\n the national coalition on health care appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations--pathways to success (cms-1701-p). the national coalition on health care (nchc) is the largest, most broadly representa- tive nonpartisan alliance of organizations focused on health care. the coalition is committed to advanc- ing\u00e2\u0080\u0094through research and analysis, public education, outreach, and informed advocacy\u00e2\u0080\u0094an affordable, high-value health care system for all stakeholders. our members and supporters include more than 80 of america\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading associations of health care providers, employers and unions, consumer and patient advocacy organizations, pension and health funds, religious denominations, and health plans.\n 2 national coalition on health care aggregate benchmarks since the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inception. the 2017 mssp results, like previous annual re1- sults, indicate that acos with longer experience in mssp are more likely to generate shared savings. performance year 2017 saw the highest share of acos (34%) generate shared savings, and the lowest percentage of acos with shared losses. over 50% of the acos that have been in mssp since 2012 earned shared savings in 2017, according to cms. 2 in addition to generating year-over-year savings relative to cms-determined benchmarks, evidence sug- gests mssp acos are also slowing the rate of per capita cost growth when compared to beneficiaries enrolled in traditional medicare who are not served by a mssp aco. it is likely that mssp is causing 3 positive spillover effects on the cost trajectory of unattributed beneficiaries in traditional medicare who also receive care from aco-affiliated clinicians. table 16 in the proposed rule highlights the correlation between markets with experienced acos, and markets experiencing the lowest cumulative per capita cost trends (which have been lower than the national average) since 2012. moreover, since benchmarks for medicare advantage premiums and annual updates are based on per capita costs and trends in fee- for-service medicare, mssp may be moderating cost growth in medicare advantage as well. high-level comments on pathway to success in light of the accumulating evidence that mssp is spurring quality improvement and moderating medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s per capita cost trajectory, we request that cms modify certain proposed model design changes to retain participation by acos who are demonstrating progress, and to attract new entrants to the program. we agree that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cend state\u00e2\u0080\u009d for acos should be two-sided risk payment models. howev- er, we recommend a steeper slope for shared savings as acos move through basic model and to en- hanced model, with flatter, asymmetric shared loss slopes, and a broader set of model end states to support a range of acos serving diverse and competitive markets, while also producing better value for medicare and beneficiaries. the national coalition recommends the eventual convergence of medicare acos with medicare ad- vantage on key model design features and parameters, such as the setting of benchmarks, capitation, an- nual updates, risk adjustment, quality metrics, and quality incentives. we recognize that this conver- gence would take time, and the feature of beneficiary choice in the aco model may limit full conver- gence. convergence of major program elements would minimize administrative complexity for medicare, providers and plans. it would also reduce beneficiary confusion, and allow more accurate comparison of performance of the two models. https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180918.957502/full/ 1 see cms, medicare shared savings program performance year 2017 financial and quality reports walk 2 through and performance results overview, august 30, 2018 slide deck.\n 3 national coalition on health care in table 1 below we highlight the proposed changes we believe will motivate continued improvement and broad participation in mssp. we believe these changes are directionally correct, but defer to experts and modelers on the specific parameters, or whether alternative approaches could produce similar incen- tives while providing similar or better fiscal protection for medicare. in table 2 we identify proposed changes that we are concerned would deter continued growth in mssp.\n 4 national coalition on health care table 2\n1. positive steps forward \n 5 national coalition on health care ipate in good faith and become more efficient. for calculating annual trend factors, we recommend that cms explore statistical approaches to remove the cost experience of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributed beneficiaries from its regional trend factor calculation.\n\n2. concerns with other proposed changes \n 7 national coalition on health care we believe it is premature and too limiting to declare the enhanced model as proposed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinal\u00e2\u0080\u009d mssp model. as the aco program matures, the end state could look different in different markets and among acos. for example, we would expect to see more acos partner with medicare advantage plans in shared risk arrangements as they become more proficient at managing risk. such acos might seek to have greater alignment between models they enter with ma or other commercial plans, and mssp. shared risk arrangements in the commercial market vary to meet the needs of both parties, and mssp models should be similarly flexible. at the same time, we may see medicare advantage risk contracting begin to adopt standard features of the mssp models, especially if a range of shared risk models are of- fered. interaction with macra advanced payment model bonus differs by aco type while the possibility of receiving a 5% bonus for participating in an alternative payment model (apm) is an added incentive for physicians and other clinicians to join a two-sided aco payment model, it is a weaker incentive for hospital-based acos. even for physician-based acos, it is extremely difficult for a clinician to know in advance if his or her revenue earned in the apm will meet or exceed the required threshold to qualify for macra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apm bonus. we also recommend that the nominal risk definition in macra for qualifying apm status (3% ) be aligned with the e model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lost sharing limit. monitor for gaming, excessive losses we support close cms monitoring of acos with shared losses or expenditures outside their corridor for two consecutive years, and termination if other behavior or organizational issues support termination. we also recognize the opportunity for acos to reorganize or otherwise terminate and re-enter to secure participation in mssp under better terms as program rules or market conditions change. we support close cms monitoring of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaming\u00e2\u0080\u009d behavior and taking action when specific gaming behavior is identi- fied. the proposed designations for experienced, inexperienced, and re-entering acos appear reason- able.\n\n", "0398": "see attached file(s) 1299 pennsylvania

sw washington, dc 20201\n re: medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations--pathways to success\n dear ms. verma,\n on behalf of the coalition to transform advanced care (c-tac), we appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this proposed rule in regard to its effects on those living with advanced illness.\n c-tac is a national non-partisan, not-for-profit organization dedicated to ensuring that all those living with advanced illness, especially the sickest and most vulnerable, receive comprehensive, high- quality, person- and family-centered care that is consistent with their goals and values and honors their dignity. c-tac is made up of over 140 national and regional organizations including patient and consumer advocacy groups, practitioners, health plans, faith-based and community organizations, and others who share a common vision of improving advanced illness care in the u.s.\n c-tac\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definition of advanced illness is when one or more conditions becomes serious enough that general health and functioning begin to decline, treatment may no longer lead to preferred outcomes, and care oriented toward comfort may take precedence over attempts to cure \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a process that extends to the end of life and that for some individuals and their families may lead to transition to hospice.\n we have several comments on this proposed rule as various sections will impact the care of those with advanced illness. specifically:\n\n 2 on risk. many will not have the needed claims data in time to make necessary organizational changes.  therefore, we recommend a longer period for both tracks to get to 2-sided risk.\n expand use of telehealth for practitioners in acos in performance-based risk arrangements c-tac is in support of increased flexibility for acos using telehealth as this will be helpful for those advanced illness management programsi using remote contact with patients. having 24/7 access is a key factor in avoiding emergency department visits or hospitalizationsii and so allowing practitioners to use telehealth could help reduce unnecessary utilization. we also support the ability of those patients to contact their aco practitioners from their home as this is the setting where most with advanced illness, and their families, are and want to be.\n we would also encourage cms to expand access to telehealth for beneficiaries in other medicare programs for the same reasons as above.\n expand skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver eligibility c-tac is in support of expanding this waiver as it will promote innovation and more person- centered care. although requiring patients to have an at least 3-day hospitalization should insure that only those who most need skilled nursing care qualify for it, it is inappropriate to hospitalize someone with snf needs just to get medicare coverage for a needed snf stay. medicare advantage (ma) plans are able to admit patients directly to snfs with a similar waiver and we agree that acos should have the same ability.\n moving beyond this waiver, we would also encourage cms to allow acos additional flexibility, such as those that medicare advantage organizations have in regard to offering supplemental benefits like home-based palliative care, transportation, or nutritional support. these would improve both the care and quality of life for those living with advanced illness and their families.\n beneficiary incentive programs we are in favor of programs that incentivize beneficiaries to participate in services that \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvance a clinical goal\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 including adherence to a treatment or drug regime, adherence to a follow-up care plan, or management of a chronic disease or condition\u00e2\u0080\u009d. those living with advanced illness usually have multiple chronic illnesses and programs that help them manage those illnesses can improve quality of life for them and their familiesiii. we appreciate that this proposed rule would give acos the flexibility to determine which types of incentives or vouchers to use as long as those incentives \u00e2\u0080\u009chave a reasonable connection to the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical care\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n 3 coordination and other benefits that come with that enrollment. we would only suggest that any notification make very clear that beneficiaries are not limited to getting their care only from the aco, but can see other practitioners or providers if needed, and that those notifications not be administratively burdensome on acos.\n primary care providers we very much support this proposed change as it will allow specialists like palliative care practitioners to be considered primary care providers for an aco. we also strongly support expanding the type of primary care practitioner to include nurse practitioner and physician assistants. many palliative care programs use these kinds of practitioners to deliver carev. our only concern in expanding this flexibility, however, is a practical one of whether the practitioners will be on interoperable information systems and able to reach the cehrt threshold.\n revisions to the definition of primary care services used in beneficiary assignment we are also strongly in support of this change and, specifically, the inclusion of advance care planning as a primary care service. although all beneficiaries should engage in advance care planning, no one knows when they might become  incapacitated, this is of particular importance and benefit to those with advanced illness who are more likely to do so. including these activities in the aco primary care services should encourage providers to have advance care planning conversations with their patients.\n however, the proposed rule mentions the proposal from the earlier physician fee schedule to remove the highest intensity evaluation and management (e/m) codes and collapse down to only two codes, which we strongly object to. an ama analysisvi showed that removing e/m levels 4 and 5 would reduce payment for office visits for hospice practitioners alone by 20%, not to mention the impact to critically important geriatricians and palliative care practitioners. we also understand that the proposed add-on payments would not be sufficient to offset these payment reductions. we therefore strongly recommend that these e/m changes not be made and urge cms to ensure that any simplification in coding/billing not discourage practitioners from spending the needed time with complex/advanced illness patients or promote more frequent, shorter interactions, which would be burdensome for such patients.  the currently proposed reduction from the five levels to only two and eliminating the ones for the most complex interactions unfortunately do both.\n\n 4 includes specific measures for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersons without cancer\u00e2\u0080\u009d but we request that those measures be modified to also include persons on palliative care or hospice.\n looking beyond these opioid-related quality measures, we encourage cms to consider ones that promote better care for those with advanced illness such as timely referral to hospice.\n thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule.  if you have any

baltimore, md 21244-8016\n re: cms-1701-p, medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094pathways to success\n 2\n cchn opposes a few key aspects of the recent proposed pathways to success rule, in particular the agency's proposal to cut acos shared savings rates below 50 percent, reduce the time in a shared savings-only model from six to two years, and application of a +/- 3 percent risk adjustment cap across an extended agreement period.\n these proposed changes will harm patients and providers by limiting improvements in savings and quality acos provide, while slowing progress made in transitioning to value-base payments. colorado\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fqhc- controlled aco, chpa, has made a significant investment in funding the operations to support the mssp, and a reduction in potential savings will greatly impact their ability to reinvest in care models/teams and will significantly limit their ability to generate enough capital to meet the repayment mechanism requirements.  as a non-profit, low revenue aco, chpa may be forced out of the mssp because they will lack the capital required for the repayment mechanism. chpa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial intention was to build up that capital over the course of six years under the current system, but that timeline is drastically reduced with the proposed changes.\n cchn appreciate cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recognition of the additional time many provider-led acos may need to transition to higher levels of two-sided risk by allowing provider-led acos to cycle through the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasic\u00e2\u0080\u009d track for two agreement periods.  however, this still only allows provider-led acos two years before taking on financial risk. due to the pace of data sharing and the imperative to transform care models, cchn recommends cms allow provider-led acos an even more gradual pathway to two-sided risk. specifically, that cms allow provider-led acos a minimum of three years in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasic\u00e2\u0080\u009d track in an upside-only arrangement.\n while  cchn  supports  incorporating  regional  expenditures  in  the  benchmark  established  for  an  aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  first agreement,  we  are  concerned  that  the  two  proposed  policies  to  limit  the  magnitude  of  the  adjustment undermines the policy goals. as cms has recognized, the incorporation of regional expenditures provides an aco with a benchmark that is more reflective of ffs spending in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s region than a benchmark based solely on the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own historical expenditures. this approach creates stronger financial incentives for acos that  have  been  successful  in  reducing  expenditures  to  remain  in  the  program,  thus  improving  program sustainability. it also allows cms to better capture the cost experience in the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s region, the health status and  socio-economic  dynamics  of  the  regional  population,  and  location-specific  medicare  payments  when compared to using national ffs expenditures.\n cchn disagrees that higher weights for the regional adjustment results in potential windfall gains to lower-cost acos. those gains are not windfalls, but instead compensate lower-cost acos for the work invested in practices to reduce the overall costs of care for medicare beneficiaries. in fact, a lower-cost aco composed of fqhcs may have higher expenditures for primary care due to the prospective payment system (pps) methodology as compared to regional expenditures for primary care services that are generally reimbursed under the medicare fee schedule.  the risk adjustment benchmarking cap uniquely will harm our non-profit fqhc-based aco. in the past, fqhcs coding processes were fairly rudimentary which is evidenced by our unusually low risk adjustment scores and unusually low benchmarks given the patient population we serve. chpa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understanding of risk adjustment is relatively new, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve implemented coding improvement efforts to more accurately reflect the acuity of their patients and to better capture hcc codes annually.  the proposed limit of +/-3% would stifle efforts to improve in these crucial areas which impact our ability to be successful in the mssp.\n cchn supports a number of proposals in the rule and encourages cms to finalize its proposals to: 1) move to five-year agreement periods; 2) reduce burdens related to quality reporting; 3) expand the use of waivers for telehealth and skilled nursing facility stays; and 4) provide flexibility with choosing assignment methodology regardless of risk model.\n 3\n cms to clarify the language in the proposed

that seeks care and must serve communities most in need of care. they turn no patient away, regardless of income, insurance status, risk, or complexity. this open-door policy is a defining feature of the fqhc mission of providing quality, affordable access to care to all who need it. additionally, beneficiary freedom of choice is an important way for practices and payers, including medicare, to gauge practice effectiveness and the demand for access to health care services in specific communities. should cms decide to allow acos to incentivize beneficiaries, it should implement safeguards to ensure that higher-revenue acos do not inadvertently attract healthier patients, potentially skewing quality metrics and leaving sicker patients with fewer options.\n thank you again for your work on

hospitals (cahs) are not in a position to take on downside risk given the inherent volatility in cost-based reimbursement. forcing these rural acos to exit the mssp would result in a loss of access to claims data, reducing the value of significant investments these acos have made (to date) to redesign rural healthcare delivery. medicares current proposal fails to provide a viable alternative for apm participation for rural acos.\r\n\r\nii.new screening criteria\r\na.medicares proposal places unnecessary regulatory oversight on acos that are negative outside corridor. new acos, and acos that expand participant lists during the agreement period, will face challenges as a result of learning curves and a lack of experience. these hurdles could reasonably result in poor financial performance twice out of a 5-year agreement period. the threat of termination does not add any new meaningful incentives for acos to avoid poor financial results, given no aco seeks to lose money (let alone repay medicare after financial reconciliation). terminating acos from the mssp without allowing sufficient time to implement necessary population health, care management, and data strategies to enhance beneficiary care and contain costs represents a fundamental disservice to the mssp and runs counter to research that suggests acos do face learning curves throughout the course of mssp participation. additionally, medicare points out in this proposed rule that numerous factors can impact the financial benchmark and its predictability (e.g., aco participant list changes, regulatory adjustments to assignment methodologies, and variation due to annual risk adjustment); thereby directly impacting an acos ability to generate savings year-over-year of the agreement.\r\n\r\niii.beneficiary incentive program\r\na.medicares proposed beneficiary incentive program would encourage beneficiaries to receive important primary care services, with the intent to assist in maintenance and improvement in health. the proposal represents an opportunity to further engage assigned beneficiaries and have them play a more active role in their healthcare. however, the proposal as it currently stands places significant burden on acos as it requires a database to track and annually report on results of the acos beneficiary incentive program. the mssp already requires each aco to have a compliance plan and controls in place to ensure compliance with mssp requirements. the burdensome compliance requirements associated with the beneficiary incentive program may discourage many acos from employing such a program.\r\n\r\niv.annual cehrt attestation\r\na.medicares proposal suggests that an aco would be required to attest to the percentage of eligible clinicians utilizing cehrt at the beginning of the calendar year. this beginning-of-the-year attestation would negatively impact acos whose aco participants make cehrt decisions (such as upgrades) based on minimum reporting periods set forth by the quality payment program. for instance, the 2015 edition of cehrt is required in calendar year 2019. however, the minimum reporting period in 2019 is a consecutive 90-day period, meaning some aco participants may not be on the 2015 edition of cehrt until october 2nd, 2019. thus, the 2019 attestation would not count eligible clinicians who are not yet using the 2015 edition of cehrt, and could drop the respective aco below the cehrt use threshold. medicare should implement an end-of-year attestation to mitigate this issue.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n

care organizations pathways to success (rin 0938-at45)\n submitted electronically via: regulations.gov\n cleveland clinic (cc) is a not-for-profit, integrated healthcare system dedicated to patient care, teaching, and research. our health system is comprised of a main campus, 10 community hospitals, and 21 family health and wellness centers with over 3,600 salaried physicians and scientists. last year, our system had 7.6 million patient visits and over 220,000 hospital admissions.\n cleveland clinic is also a current participant in the medicare shared savings program track 1+, effective january of this year. this is our second contract in mssp; cleveland clinic participated in track 1 from 2015-2017. our aco includes over 100,000 assigned beneficiaries who receive care across the cleveland clinic system.\n by virtue of participation in track 1+, cleveland clinic has opted to share the financial responsibility of the cost of medicare beneficiaries with the federal government. this relationship with the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) was new this year, a decision made after careful thought and consideration.\n we understand that cms and the department of health and human services (hhs) envision a future where health systems like cleveland clinic take on greater accountability for managing the health care budgets of our patients.1 cleveland clinic does not oppose taking on financial risk; many of our contracts with government and non-government payers include such arrangements.\n however, an agreement to assume financial risk must include a pathway for cleveland clinic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and other healthcare providers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to meaningfully track and manage performance. we fear that ability is lacking in the medicare shared savings program right now. benchmarks move unpredictably year to year, and performance data lags, challenging our ability to take action. we also note that cms is amending the financial performance metrics for the medicare shared savings program yet again, suggesting that the methodology has not yet been perfected.\n we hope that cms will continue to make improvements to the medicare shared savings program that make the possibility of taking on financial risk less daunting and reflective of the shared\n 2 the cleveland clinic foundation 9500 euclid avenue / na4 cleveland, ohio 44195 tel 216 445-7445 fax 216 444-2436 morrisk@ccf.org\n responsibility between cleveland clinic and cms. we also hope that cms will continue to explore additional alternative payment models that could provide other avenues to explore financial risk.\n in support of these goals, the following are the comments of cleveland clinic in respect of the captioned proposed rule.\n participation options\n distinct participation options based on aco performance cms is proposing to create different participation options for acos based on the revenue they derive from medicare parts a and b, as well as prior experience with performance-based risk. cms cites the fact that higher revenue acos are more likely to include a hospital and, therefore, be more likely to control costs.\n we object to creating different tracks for acos based on revenue. we do not support distinct participation options for high-revenue versus low-revenue acos as proposed. acos in the medicare shared savings program should be subject to the same set of rules and performance criteria regardless of its size and makeup. to suggest the presence of revenue is necessarily tied to an advantage in managing patient populations is flawed.\n benchmarking and financial performance\n moratorium on methodology changes during contract period though this is not directly responsive to a proposal, we urge cms to refrain from imposing on participating acos any changes to the benchmark or financial performance methodology during an existing agreement period. instead, if cms makes any such changes, it should provide acos with sufficient data to assess the impact on their performance and allow them to elect whether to adopt the change immediately or to defer until the next agreement period.\n predicting and modelling financial performance in the medicare shared savings program is challenging. the open-ended nature of medicare fee for service lends itself to unpredictable swings in financial performance. mid-performance changes that impact how those targets are calculated make the task even more difficult.\n risk adjustment cms has proposed to modify the risk adjustment methodology to account for changes in case mix and severity of assigned beneficiaries. changes in risk score growth would be capped at +/-3% over the life of the contract.\n we are grateful that cms is reviewing the issue of risk adjustment. beneficiaries with higher risk scores can reasonably be expected to require more care and services, making it likely that their costs will exceed those of beneficiaries with more average risk scores. financial benchmarks should acknowledge this likelihood when data is available.\n 3 the cleveland clinic foundation 9500 euclid avenue / na4 cleveland, ohio 44195 tel 216 445-7445 fax 216 444-2436 morrisk@ccf.org\n denies the availability of information that provides an accurate picture. we urge cms to remove this cap. as a point of reference, we encourage cms to look at the process used to set rates in medicare advantage, in which risk score growth is not capped in a given year.\n national trend factor cms proposes to use both a regional and national trend factor, with greater weight to the national trend factor when an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s penetration in a market is higher. cms attributes the latter policy to concern about acos receiving credit for gains that do not reflect strong performance.\n we oppose the proposal to apply greater weight to the national trend factor solely based on market penetration. an assessment of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effectiveness should not be tied to the size of market penetration; cms should be able to set a financial target in a market that determines whether or not an aco was effective in generating savings, rather than creating a moving target based on an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s individual circumstances.\n regional trend factor cms proposes to incorporate regional factors into the process of setting financial benchmarks for an aco. in so doing, cms will create a regional comparison group that includes both beneficiaries assigned to an aco and those that are not.\n we believe the purpose of tracking regional trends should be to assess whether or not the medicare shared savings program is generating savings for the medicare program when compared to medicare beneficiaries not impacted by the program. to that end, we encourage cms to remove beneficiaries assigned to an aco from the regional comparison group.\n\n program rules\n telehealth cms is proposing to extend waivers from medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s originating site requirements for telehealth services to acos taking on downside risk, including those in track 1+, effective 2020. this proposal is consistent with a statutory mandate in the chronic care act passed earlier this year.\n in april, cleveland clinic and three other acos participating in medicare shared savings program track 1+ wrote to administrator verma, asking that track 1+ be included in the flexibilities prescribed by the chronic care act; for the effective date to be expedited to 2019; and for the waiver to cover a broad range of services.\n we are pleased that cms will extend waivers from originating site requirements to acos participating in track 1+. this inclusion was consistent with the federal statute.\n we renew our request that cms make the telehealth waivers available to track 1+ acos beginning in 2019. while the statute for the chronic care act specified a 2020 date, cms has the authority to make this flexibility available earlier using the authority of the center for medicare and medicaid innovation.\n 4 the cleveland clinic foundation 9500 euclid avenue / na4 cleveland, ohio 44195 tel 216 445-7445 fax 216 444-2436 morrisk@ccf.org\n availability of prospective assignment cms proposed to make prospective assignment available to all acos, consistent with congressional direction in the chronic care act. we applaud this policy.\n hybrid assignment approach cms sought comments on a proposed hybrid assignment approach. under the hybrid approach, beneficiaries would have the ability to make an affirmative determination to opt in to an aco, or would be assigned if registering seven or more claims with providers in a given aco.\n we have great concern about the hybrid approach. while we support the ability of beneficiaries to make an affirmative selection, we believe the seven-claim threshold is high enough to fundamentally change the medicare shared savings program. the vast majority of potentially attributable aco beneficiaries are not high-risk and, therefore, may never need seven primary care service visits in a given period of time. additionally, organizations like ours have initiatives aimed at giving beneficiaries alternative types of visits that are not necessarily traditional primary care services, like pharmacy consultations and shared medical appointments. the potentially avoidable unintended consequence is a dramatic drop in attribution to the point that acos across the country will put into place infrastructure to better care for the patients they serve but never have those patients ultimately attributed to them.\n our aco currently includes over 100,000 medicare beneficiaries. the odds of even a simple majority of those beneficiaries making an affirmative selection or making seven clinical visits in a year is unlikely. this policy would likely gut our aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned population.\n an aco should be judged not just on how it manages those beneficiaries with chronic needs, but how it manages those beneficiaries who are healthy and remain so. we strongly encourage cms not to finalize this hybrid approach.\n site of service issues in assignment cms is proposing to eliminate the use of point of service codes for beneficiaries in skilled nursing facilities for purposes of beneficiary attribution.\n we strongly support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed policy. we raised this issue with cms last year and are grateful to see the agency take action to remedy our concerns in this area.\n thank you for conducting a thoughtful process that allows us to provide input on such important issues and for your consideration of this information. should you need any further information, please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t

administrator verma:\n summa health writes today to respectfully comment on the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations: pathways to success (cms\u00e2\u0080\u00931701\u00e2\u0080\u0093p).\n at summa health, we actively embrace value-based care models.  we are sponsors and leaders of newhealth collaborative (nhc), a highly successful track 1 mssp aco in terms of both savings achieved and consistently high quality scores (90th percentile and above) since we launched nhc in 2012. our health plan, summacare,  a 4.5 star medicare advantage (ma) plan, is a payer partner and summa health medical group physicians are participating providers in the oncology care model (ocm \u00e2\u0080\u0093 track 1); and we have summacare as a payer partner and 14 summa health medical group primary care practices in the comprehensive primary care plus (cpc+) program, track 2. we are located in one of the 34 msas selected as a continuation of the mandatory cjr model experiment. most recently, summa has signed on to participate in 20 bpci advanced bundles (19 inpatient and 1 outpatient). we are committed to the quadrupleaim, working to improve the total health of the communities we serve by engaging in activities that result in better care, smarter spending, healthier patients and more satisfied providers and caregivers.\n\n 2\n we are members of premier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population health management collaborative, and support the comments they have developed in collaboration with their health system partners.  from our vantage point as an integrated delivery system actively tackling the challenge of shifting from volume to value, we offer the following targeted comments on the proposed rule that evolves the medicare shared savings program (mssp):\n recommendation 1: do not create a 6-month performance year for acos in current mssp models that expire december 31, 2018. instead, allow acos to extend their current agreements for one year, resulting in a january 1, 2020 start date under a new pathways to success model.  alternatively, if cms remains committed to a july 1, 2019 start date for this program upon rule finalization, entities that face a december 31, 2018 expiration date of their current model should be allowed to extend their current agreement until june 30, 2019, and then begin an 18-month first performance year under the new agreement. for all aco entities, but particularly those facing the 6- month extension situation, we ask cms reduce complexity by creating a singular assignment window and methodology across all acos for calendar year 2019.  finally, related to quality payment program (qpp) performance in cy 2019; if in an aapm for the 6-month period of july 1-december 31, deem the aco to meet the first prong of the aapm test for the entire year, and allow use of entire cy 2019 data in calculating qp thresholds.\n\n 3\n into the new model.  finally, given the interconnected nature of mssp to the qpp, it is similarly crucial that cms policy development not inadvertently deter acos like ours from transitioning to risk in 2019.  if cms choses to extend current model agreements for one year before entering the new model, summa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nhc would continue on as a mips-apm for the 2019 qpp evaluation year.  if cms finalizes a policy requiring a july 1, 2019 start date, relative to qpp, we respectfully ask that cms consider those aco entities that take risk in tracks that meet the aapm standard to be considered in the aapm for the entire calendar year for purposes of computing the qp thresholds.\n recommendation 2: create tiered glidepath from level e into enhanced track for high revenue acos.\n rationale: after the first 5-year period in the basic track ends, we strongly recommend that cms either tier the enhanced track to offer an additional step-wise formula to increasing the risk/reward exposure to providers (akin to the different levels within basic); or create a bridge between basic and enhanced.  a bridge program or tiered enhanced structure would allow providers to move forward in their risk-taking for a portion of the 5-years in the second agreement period. further, we request cms encourage providers participating in making this transition by setting the shared savings rate at 80 percent, and increase the maximum shared savings and losses rate over the agreement period.\n recommendation 3: clarify the interaction between bpci advanced and the pathways to success models as soon as possible.\n rationale: as an entity that recently committed to 20 bpci advanced bundles beginning oct 1, we respectfully request that cms clarify the interaction between bpci advanced and the pathways to success tracks as soon as possible.  for example, the proposed enhanced track shares characteristics of the mssp track 3 which in its current state cancels any bpci advanced episodes attributed to track 3 participants. we are committed to staying the course for the full 5 years of bpci advanced, but under the proposed rule would see pronounced changes when moving to the enhanced track. given the financial and operational investment we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve recently made in bpci advanced, including our partnership with remedy, providers need to understand explicitly how cms intends to handle the interaction of the two programs as we make our business decisions regarding the optimal pathways to success program for the next agreement period.\n recommendation 4: remove the proposed cap on beneficiary risk score growth.\n\n 4\n the trend in risk score growth among medicare fee-for-service (ffs)beneficiaries over the 5-year period from 2013-2017 is greater than 3 percent.  we instead encourage cms to develop a formulaic means of adjusting for risk score growth that is reflective of what trends in the ffs population demonstrate.  cms could look to leverage the ma risk score computation and process for the aco program.\n if we can provide further detail or specification on our above mentioned priorities, please contact derrick hall, system director, bundled payment

savings program; accountable care organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094 pathways to success (cms-1701-p)\n dear administrator verma:\n the next generation accountable care organization (aco) coalition writes to provide comments on the medicare shared savings program (mssp) proposed rule.  the coalition represents 33 participants in the next generation aco program who are committed to the future of two-sided risk models to create value in medicare and improve patient care and outcomes.  while many organizations across the country continue to plan and prepare to move into higher levels of risk, our members are at the forefront of meaningful delivery system reform.  the next gen acos are already successfully taking financial and clinical accountability for their patient populations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 generally across multiple lines of business such as ma, commercial risk, medicaid risk, programs for duals and of course medicare aco risk - with significant results in better care for their patients and savings for the federal government.\n the next gen aco participants have already shown that performance-based risk can transform care delivery.  a recent report by norc at the university of chicago for the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) highlighted the next gen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s widespread use of care management, chronic disease management and clinical programs, as well as an enhanced focus on primary care.  in addition, the administration touted $61 million in savings in the first year of the program across 18 model participants.  the next gen program has tremendous potential to continue to build on its early achievements, and we believe that other organizations can learn from this experience and also succeed in two- sided risk models.\n consistent with our commitment to the success of risk-bearing programs in traditional medicare, we provide the below guiding principles for your consideration as you finalize the mssp program rules.\n\n\n\n\nwww.nextgenaco.com \n 1) continue to incentivize the move to higher levels of risk. we are encouraged to see that through this rule, the administration is advancing opportunities in two-sided risk acos through this proposed rule.  we have seen firsthand the type of care transformation that is possible when organizations participate in performance-based risk to improve population health.  we are also pleased with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to waiving and modifying burdensome program rules for organizations that are engaged in increasing levels of financial risk.  examples in this rule include the beneficiary incentive program, telehealth wavier and the skilled nursing facility three-day stay waiver, all of which will apply to certain organizations engaged in two-sided financial models.  this flexibility will be key to encouraging the move to performance-based risk.\n however, we believe that more can be done to facilitate the transition.  as you finalize this rule and consider additional models in the future, we encourage the agency to work with organizations engaged in two-sided risk models across medicare (hmo & ppo), medicaid and commercial populations to identify other regulatory barriers that can be removed to further encourage the transition to higher levels of accountability.  we believe that greater program flexibility should be available to organizations taking on higher levels of risk \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that additional incentives should be created that are available to organizations at higher levels of risk than for those at lower levels of risk.\n 2) create consistency across programs. we respectfully request that cms continue to identify areas within the rules where the agency can create consistency across different medicare aco programs and even more broadly across the delivery system reform portfolio, including in medicare advantage. there may be some areas of program differentiation that remain important, such as differences that incentivize higher levels of risk-taking.  however, we note that there remain a number of areas from beneficiary attribution to payment methodology that differ substantially across the different programs. this is an issue for organizations advancing risk across multiple payment models and looking for greater predictability, transparency and simplicity.   we would welcome the opportunity to work with the agency to identify and evaluate where these programs differ and where harmonizing rules could benefit providers, patients and payers.\n\nwww.nextgenaco.com \n methodology and we would welcome the opportunity to work to develop an approach that incorporates lessons learned from mssp and the medicare advantage program.\n 4) create permanence for the next gen program. as cms considers and further develops the glide path to risk, we recommend that the agency create a voluntary, permanent aco option that incorporates the features of the ngaco model.  the next gen program participants have shown success with higher levels of two-sided risk and have made investments to bring delivery system changes to their local communities.  permanence would bring greater stability and predictability to our efforts.  in addition, a permanent model could serve to provide additional direction and goals for providers entering the mssp today.  we also note that a voluntary, permanent next gen-like offering could provide an opportunity to reduce administrative burden for next gens by streamlining program requirements.\n in conclusion, we appreciate your commitment to performance-based risk and creating a glide path for organizations to move to higher levels of risk. our organizations have seen the success of these models and we look forward to continuing to work with cms to advance better care for patients, providers and payers across traditional medicare. please do not hesitate to contact mara mcdermott

[cms-1701-p] medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations--pathways to success\n dear administrator verma:\n the medicare rights center (medicare rights) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the on the proposed changes to medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations--pathways to success. medicare rights is a national, nonprofit organization that works to ensure access to affordable health care for older adults and people with disabilities through counseling and advocacy, educational programs, and public policy initiatives. medicare rights provides services and resources to three million people with medicare, family caregivers, and professionals each year.\n the comments that follow are informed by our experience assisting people as they navigate the medicare program. we discuss the importance of including the beneficiary perspective in efforts to create a patient-centered health care system that promotes value and that preserves and bolsters the consumer protections that are at the heart of the medicare program.\n we appreciate the work the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) is doing to streamline and modernize the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and to ensure its long- term success. while it is clear that the current program needs to be improved, we continue to support its underlying goal of increasing value and beneficiary well-being in the health system.\n streamlining participation options and limiting one-sided risk\n 2 different timelines, and all would push accountable care organizations (acos) up in risk automatically. most notably, they would shorten the time acos could spend participating via one-sided risk. currently, one-sided risk through track 1 is available for up to six years. in the reformulation, the basic track levels a and b would allow acos to participate with one-sided risk for two years (plus six months for acos that participate starting july 1, 2019). after that, acos would be automatically promoted to levels that include two-sided risk.\n recent data seem to show that acos are helping to stem cost increases in medicare. for example, cms estimates that in 2017, 472 mssp acos caring for nine million beneficiaries generated gross savings of $1.1 billion and netted $314 million in savings to the medicare trust fund.1 recent peer-reviewed studies by harvard university researchers have found that the mssp slightly increased medicare spending in 2013 but saved $286.9 million in 2014, even after accounting for shared savings bonuses earned by acos.2\n these data indicate that shared savings contracts without downside risk may be a fiscally viable alternative payment model for medicare. but in the proposed rule, cms suggests that some acos\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically acos that do not accept two-sided risk\u00e2\u0080\u0094have increased medicare spending. this appears to be a miscalculation. unfortunately, many of the proposals in the nprm have as their underlying rationale an assertion that acos with one-sided risk are not saving the medicare program money. if this rationale is in error, many of the proposed changes become less urgent or even counterproductive. if track 1\u00e2\u0080\u0094one-sided risk\u00e2\u0080\u0094acos save medicare dollars, changes that may drive these acos from participation are unwise.\n this makes it extremely important to understand the risks and advantages of altering aco risk options. because the data do not appear to agree with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rationale, we are concerned that this proposal would curtail the promise and possibilities of the mssp program by limiting participation unnecessarily.\n cms argues that acos in two-sided models perform better over time than one-sided model acos. this may be true, but this correlation does not necessarily mean that the move to two- sided risk was the cause of the improved performance. we would predict that acos that expect to be successful at managing risk would be more likely to accept risk. that their self-assessment is accurate should not come as a complete surprise.\n cms also notes that track 1 acos are reluctant to move to two-sided risk. we cannot know if such acos have good reason for their reluctance and would choose to abandon the mssp rather than accept untenable risk. a national association of acos (naacos) survey showed that\n71.4% of acos indicated they would likely leave the mssp if they were forced to assume risk.3 \n while some of these acos are likely either overstating their reluctance or could be persuaded\n 1 centers for medicare & medicaid services, \u00e2\u0080\u009c2017 shared savings program (ssp) accountable care

2014,\u00e2\u0080\u009d jama. \n 3 otherwise through other incentives, we are troubled that so many find cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed shift daunting.\n given these concerns, we suggest more work should be done to reconcile cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statements about track 1 aco costs and both independent and cms data showing track 1 acos producing considerable savings.4 further, the current use of benchmarks as analytic counterfactuals undercounts aco savings by comparing them to an aco-lowered national average.5\n even if it makes sense to spur acos to more quickly accept risk, it may be that the change from six to two years is too abrupt. we encourage cms to thoroughly investigate its options before committing to a change that may endanger participation in the mssp.\n determining participation options based on medicare fee-for-service (ffs) revenue and prior participation\n cms proposes to adopt policies that would more strictly police gaming within the mssp. we support robust oversight of all medicare options and believe cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in predicting and curtailing gaming in new value-based models is essential. we encourage cms to explore the ways bad actors may use current or new structures to take advantage of programmatic rules or beneficiaries.6 ultimately, people with medicare suffer when loopholes and poor incentives are permitted.\n this new oversight would be increasingly necessary if cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals to change how acos are treated based on their revenue are adopted. in the nprm, cms proposes that low-revenue acos have more flexibility to avoid risk than high-revenue acos and suggests that high- revenue acos have greater ability to control spending than low-revenue acos. this bifurcation of the mssp could be counterproductive if the high-revenue acos either reform their ownership to count as low-revenue acos or, worse, if they avoid the mssp program entirely, thus denying medicare the potential savings. entities that have the greatest potential for savings should arguably be given more incentive to participate, not less.\n ffs benefit enhancements\n skilled nursing facility (snf) waiver\n currently, eligible track 3 acos can apply for a waiver of the three-day inpatient hospitalization requirement before a snf admission for prospectively assigned beneficiaries. cms proposes to extend this waiver to all acos that participate in two-sided risk. if the\n 4 restructuring of the tracks takes place as proposed, this would include both the basic track (levels c, d, and e) and the enhanced track. further, cms proposes to allow this waiver for acos using prospective assignment or preliminary prospective assignment with retrospective reconciliation, and to allow critical access hospitals or rural hospitals with swing-bed arrangements to be eligible partners for waiver purposes.\n the requirement for a qualifying hospital stay of three consecutive days as an admitted inpatient prior to a covered snf stay was included in the original medicare legislation7 to \u00e2\u0080\u009chelp limit the payment of the extended care benefits to persons for whom such care may reasonably be presumed to be required in connection with continued treatment following hospital inpatient care\u00e2\u0080\u009d while at the same time making \u00e2\u0080\u009cless likely unduly long hospital stays.\u00e2\u0080\u009d8 but progress in medicine since that date has permitted shorter hospital stays in general, without eliminating the ongoing need for follow-up snf care to ensure the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety and well-being.\n in addition, many beneficiaries go to the hospital and remain there for several days without ever being admitted as inpatients. this type of stay, usually called an \u00e2\u0080\u009cobservation stay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d often looks exactly like an inpatient admission from the beneficiary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective. importantly, if patients are never admitted as inpatients, even if they spend over three days in the hospital, they will not be eligible for medicare coverage of a subsequent snf stay. and they do not have the ability to formally appeal their classification as outpatients. this means that if they are transferred to a snf, they will be responsible for the entire cost of their care.9\n [i]n 2012, medicare beneficiaries had more than 600,000 hospital stays that were at least three days long but would not have qualified the beneficiary for snf services because the patient was classified as an outpatient for some or all of the stay. more than 25,000 of the beneficiaries in these 600,000 hospital stays were discharged to an snf following their hospital stays even though they did not qualify for medicare part a snf coverage. because the three-day inpatient stay requirement was not met, such beneficiaries could have been liable for substantial costs related to bed and board, drugs/biologicals, durable medical equipment, and nursing care received during their snf stays.10\n the use of observation stays is increasing as a result of multiple factors, including but not limited to:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 medicare payment policy changes and increased reporting;\n 7 the social security amendments of 1965, pub.l. 89\u00e2\u0080\u009397.\n8 u.s. congress, house committee on ways and means, report of the committee on ways and means on h.r. \n 6675, 89th cong., 1st sess., march 1965, no. 213 (washington: gpo, 1965), p. 27. 9 medicare interactive, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedicare and observation

10 scott r. talaga, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skilled nursing facility (snf) three-day inpatient stay requirement: in brief,\u00e2\u0080\u009d congressional research service (june 2, 2016), available at https://www.ahcancal.org/advocacy/solutions/documents/congressional%20research%20services%20report%20o n%20three-day%20stay%20requirement.pdf.\n 5 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increased scrutiny by both public and private payers of short inpatient stays; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 efficiency advantages for hospitals of observation stays over inpatient admission; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 incentives to reduce hospital admissions. as of march 8, 2017, hospitals are required to provide patients with a medicare outpatient observation notice (moon) if they are being kept in observation status rather than admitted as inpatients. but the notice is simply informational; there is no formal medicare appeal process through which a beneficiary can challenge their outpatient status.\n both the three-day requirement and the observation stay exclusion\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the financial incentives that underlie these policies\u00e2\u0080\u0094can usurp the provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in determining what care is medically necessary and in the best interest of the patient. providers must provide safe and adequate care and discharge planning for people with medicare, and hospitals are not permitted to discharge a patient if there is no such safe discharge plan. a snf will not generally accept a private pay patient who does not have the resources to guarantee payment, so this is a quandary for patients and providers when the patient needs snf care but cannot afford to private pay.\n in a worst-case scenario, beneficiaries may self-discharge against medical advice and return home before they are physically or mentally ready, and potentially suffer further devastating and expensive acute health effects. barring this, the patient may end up staying in the hospital past the time they would otherwise have been transferred into less costly care options, or seek alternative care that is covered by medicare, but that might not be the most appropriate setting for their needs.\n for these reasons, we support an extension of aco ability to transfer patients to snfs without the otherwise required three-day inpatient stay. allowing acos to ensure beneficiaries can access and afford needed care is critical if the model is to be truly patient-centered.\n telehealth\n cms proposes that since acos with prospective beneficiary assignment would have the opportunity to provide telehealth services, beneficiaries who are prospectively assigned at the start of the year, but are subsequently excluded from assignment, should be protected by a 90- day grace period. as proposed, this means cms would waive the originating site requirement and pay for otherwise covered telehealth services furnished to a qualifying beneficiary during the grace period.  further, cms proposes that if the aco provides otherwise-eligible telehealth services to a beneficiary who is not prospectively assigned, the aco participant must not charge the beneficiary for the expenses; must return any money already collected; and may be subject to compliance actions including a corrective action plan. we support these vital protections. because of the nature of acos beneficiaries are not positioned to know where they are prospectively assigned, if at all, or to understand and abide by the mssp rules. the aco entities must be responsible for these charges and hold the beneficiaries harmless.\n providing tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n 6\n as required by the bipartisan budget act of 2018, acos participating in two-sided risk (including basic track acos in levels c, d, or e and enhanced track acos if the proposed streamlining of options occurs) would be allowed to apply to establish a cms- approved beneficiary incentive program to provide incentive payments to eligible beneficiaries for qualifying services. cms seeks comments on whether an aco that offers a beneficiary incentive program should be required to notify cms of any modifications prior to its implementation. we support such notification. beneficiary incentive programs are potential sources of inappropriate steering and gaming and must be closely monitored to ensure that beneficiary interests are protected. because much of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activities are behind the scenes, cms must take care that mssp participants are not given free rein to influence or attempt to influence beneficiary choice and assignment.\n cms proposes to prohibit cash incentives as they are more difficult to track. cms also proposes that acos maintain records including the identity of patient and provider, amount of incentive, date of service, and date of payment. we support this proposal as well as the proposal that these records must be made available.\n cms also seeks comment on when or if it would be appropriate for an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficiary incentive program to be terminated by the secretary. a termination option should be available for instances when an aco is using the program to steer or influence beneficiaries improperly, or if the aco fails to maintain or make available records, or otherwise fails to meet the requirements of the program. as abruptly ending these programs could have negative implications for participating beneficiaries, we encourage cms to clearly establish standards with which acos must comply in order to operate beneficiary incentive programs. termination should be a last resort, and beneficiaries as well as the public should have advance notice and the opportunity to comment for the record. cms must ensure that beneficiary access to care is not jeopardized by a termination.\n cms proposes to prohibit advertisement of a beneficiary incentive program. we agree. this is too fraught with risk that beneficiaries could be steered toward the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s providers and services, directly or indirectly. cms asks, however, what should be done to make beneficiaries aware of the program and whether cms should supply template language on the topic. because we support cms template language for sensitive issues within value-based models that are particularly prone to steering or other inappropriate behavior, we strongly support this proposal.11 in addition, we urge cms to conduct beneficiary testing and share draft language with stakeholders to ensure the template truly conveys the existence of such a program in neutral ways that are easily understandable and not misleading or otherwise inappropriate.\n cms also proposes to require public reporting of the total number of beneficiaries, the total number of incentive payments, codes for such payments, the total value of all incentive payments, and the total type of each payment. we support this reporting. public reporting enables interested beneficiaries to find more information and also allows researchers and\n 7 advocates to investigate the use of such programs. we encourage cms to take necessary measures to protect beneficiary information and privacy.\n beneficiary notifications\n cms proposes to require additional content for beneficiary notifications and that beneficiaries receive such notices at the first primary care visit of each performance year. the notifications currently inform beneficiaries that their providers are participating in the mssp, that they have the opportunity to decline claims data sharing, and that they have the ability to change identification of a primary care provider for purposes of voluntary alignment. cms proposes further to require aco participants to use a template notice from cms that would provide details regarding a step-by-step process for voluntary alignment. we support these changes. as discussed above, sensitive issues within value-based models that are particularly prone to steering are ideal for cms templates, especially those that have been consumer tested for clarity and effectiveness.\n cms also seeks comment on whether the template notice should include other information outlining aco activities that may be related to or affect a medicare ffs beneficiary, including aco quality reporting and improvement activities; aco financial incentives to lower growth in expenditures; aco care redesign processes (such as use of care coordinators); the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of payment rule waivers (such as the snf 3-day rule waiver); and the availability of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficiary incentive program. we support including this information as it would strengthen consumer awareness and confidence in the program.\n cms seeks feedback on the format, content, and frequency of this additional notice. as noted throughout, we urge cms to do consumer testing on all notices to ensure the information is conveyed accurately and objectively and in a manner the beneficiary can use.\n beneficiary \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cms notes that some stakeholders support allowing a beneficiary to \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d to assignment in a specific aco. absent this option, its proponents claim, a beneficiary has little or no incentive or requirement to cooperate with the aco. to this end, cms seeks comments on whether to create an alternative beneficiary assignment methodology under which a beneficiary would be assigned to an aco if the beneficiary has \u00e2\u0080\u009copted-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d to assignment to the aco. the rationale that an opt- in is preferable because beneficiaries lack incentives or requirements suggests that the stakeholders in question believe the opt in would provide such incentive or requirement. we are deeply opposed to such an approach, which would seemingly transform acos from a freely chosen model into a clone of medicare advantage (ma). indeed, cms notes that opting in could be similar to enrolling in an ma plan, with the potential for election periods. (of course, ma has no tools by which to \u00e2\u0080\u009crequire\u00e2\u0080\u009d beneficiaries to cooperate, so this language is additionally troubling.) cms notes the potential for great confusion with this option and makes clear that \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeneficiaries opting-in to assignment to an aco would still retain the freedom to choose to receive care from any medicare-enrolled provider or supplier, including providers and suppliers outside the aco.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n 8 this discussion makes it extremely difficult to understand the incentive (or indeed the \u00e2\u0080\u009crequirement\u00e2\u0080\u009d) potential of the opt-in process. what are beneficiaries gaining, or standing to lose, by opting in? how does opting in change their relationship with the aco? how does opting in differ from voluntary assignment from the beneficiary perspective? we oppose any proposal that would increase the burden on beneficiaries, lock them into any arrangements with providers, or otherwise curtail their access to care. fee-for-service medicare allows freedom of provider choice by definition.\n cms notes that any opt-in process would require safeguards similar to those placed on the ma program, including marketing guidelines and requirements to prevent cherry picking or discrimination. we agree that ma has such safeguards, and note they are needed, in part, because ma is a limit on choice. we object to any efforts to allow acos to mimic ma limits on choice. until the parameters of any tradeoffs beneficiaries would be making by opting in are perfectly clear, we cannot suggest what safeguards must be in place.\n conclusion\n thank you for your consideration. we look forward to working together to advance policies that consider and balance the needs of all stakeholders while promoting high-value and high-quality care. for additional information, please contact lindsey copeland, federal policy director at lcopeland@medicarerights.org or

health systems to help them finance, operate and manage their value-based businesses. we work in financially and operationally aligned partnerships with risk-based accountable care organizations (acos) and provider-sponsored health plans (pshps) in medicare, medicaid and commercial populations. founded in 2011, evolent is proud to count more than 40 provider and payer organizations as aligned partners, jointly managing more than three million patients under value-based arrangements. this includes over 10 health plans and 14 medicare or medicaid acos with more than 4,000 physicians and other clinicians participating in value-based arrangements in which evolent is operationally and financially aligned with our partners. supporting independent provider organizations is an increasing focus of our business. evolent also owns and operates its own health plan division, called true health, which currently serves the commercial market and is soon to expand into the medicare advantage program.\n evolent is strongly aligned with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 guiding principles of driving value in health care, offering financial and clinical accountability to providers, and empowering consumers with the choice and transparency needed to help improve their own care in close partnership with properly incentivized providers. the current medicare fee-for-service (ffs) system, as well as some current aco models, have not been designed to promote innovation in payment and care delivery. fully reorienting our health care system toward value will require cms to create additional opportunities for providers to assume full accountability across all populations. cms has taken bold and important steps in its medicare shared savings program (mssp) proposed rule to move acos in that direction. ultimately medicare beneficiaries should have \u00e2\u0080\u009cno wrong door\u00e2\u0080\u009d to access high-value health care, whether they enter two-sided risk acos or similar alternative payment models, or medicare advantage plans. over time, traditional fee-for-service medicare not tied to value should comprise a much smaller share of the program.\n\n response to the proposed rule\n\n redesigning participation options to facilitate transition to performance-based risk\n evolent supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s redesign of the medicare shared savings program to accelerate aco adoption of performance-based risk, including time-limiting the proposed basic track and requiring all mssp participants to accept two-sided risk by 2021. these changes will provide greater stability and predictability and will help more providers benefit from qualifying as advanced alternative payment models under medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality payment program. strong guideposts are critical to moving health care providers and organizations that may otherwise be risk-averse, even if they are capable of taking on greater risk with the proper incentives and support. cms has taken a thoughtful approach to ensuring a glide path for providers into risk, which factors in acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 revenue and experience.\n\n 800 n. glebe road  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  suite 500  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  arlington, virginia 22203  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  evolenthealth.com program through separate rulemaking under sec. 1115a authority, could offer the opportunity for provider organizations experienced in managing risk to accept 80 percent or 100 percent upside and downside risk, resulting in high-quality, coordinated care for beneficiaries and significant savings to the medicare trust fund. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first annual report on the next gen aco program showed significant savings to medicare \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a 1.1 percent reduction in medicare spending (more than $62 million net of shared savings payments) and improved utilization and quality of care across several domains for the 18 participants in performance-year one (2016).\n we believe that the characteristics of more fully accountable programs, such as medicare advantage and the ngaco model, provide a sustainable foundation for supporting financial accountability among providers. with a few specific design alterations, the core components of the ngaco model could serve as a chassis for future innovative programs such as the direct provider contracting (dpc) model. these design features should be consistent across all cms programs and include the following:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 high-value integrated provider networks that accept financial accountability \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 financial opportunity that is maximized through two-sided risk design \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 voluntary, inclusive participation for all practices with tailored support for smaller practices \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 open patient enrollment and freedom of choice for consumers \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 standardization of performance accelerators within programs\n\n mssp start date and duration\n cms has proposed a six-month extension for current mssp acos whose agreements expire at the end of 2018, along with a special one-time july 1, 2019 start date. current and prospective aco leaders are evaluating their options with respect to not only the mssp start date, but to participation in other potential models such as the dpc model anticipated to be released by cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innovation center (cmmi). we urge cms to take the whole payment model landscape into account and to take any measures necessary to maximize the level of certainty for providers and to incentivize participation in higher-risk models over lower-risk models. for example, participants in mssp or cmmi models should not be excluded from switching to dpc when it first comes online, regardless of where they are in their program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifecycle.\n evolent supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to extend participation agreements from three years to five years in duration, as acos tend to perform better the longer they remain in the program. further, under longer agreement periods, historical benchmarks would become more predictable, since the benchmark would continue to be based on the expenditures for beneficiaries who would have been assigned to the aco in the three most recent years prior to the start of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreement period.\n\n risk adjustment\n cms has proposed eliminating the distinction between new and continuously assigned beneficiaries for the purposes of risk adjustment. we support this change. applying risk adjustment uniformly to all assigned beneficiaries should improve payment accuracy and encourage acos to serve patients with more complex conditions.\n\n 800 n. glebe road  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  suite 500  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  arlington, virginia 22203  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  evolenthealth.com cms has also proposed a new risk adjustment methodology for mssp acos that allows \u00e2\u00b13 percent change in the benchmark to accommodate rising (or decreasing) hierarchical condition category (hcc) risk scores between the baseline year and the performance year. evolent believes this is a step in the right direction for mssp. however, our experience as an operating partner for 10 next gen acos has taught us that the \u00e2\u00b13 percent range is insufficient, which would especially be the case over the course of a five-year agreement period. we are concerned that many mssp acos will exceed the 3 percent cap organically (i.e. not due to coding intensity but rather due to a true increase in beneficiary acuity), which would be an unfair and artificial hindrance to these organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to be successful in the program. while we acknowledge and appreciate the risk adjustment projections that cms has performed (as described on page 361 of the proposed rule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original publication), we have learned from our own experiences in the ngaco model that it is extremely difficult to forecast risk scores, especially over multiple years. furthermore, the 30 percent projection still constitutes a large number of acos that would be hamstrung by the risk score cap.\n reduction in risk scores through an annual coding adjustment alone should be sufficient to address cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concern about paying more due to increasing coding intensity. we believe that the best approach is for cms to remove any caps on maximum risk adjustment in mssp while still guarding against overpayment by leveraging a predictable, annual coding factor adjustment. for example, cms could preserve its ability, with advance regulatory notice to acos, to retroactively modify the projected coding factor if the final observed risk trend for the applicable performance years deviates significantly from the projected coding factor. this approach is currently used in the ngaco program. it is our opinion that a prospectively set coding factor adjustment is preferable to the proposed renormalization approach because the coding factor approach addresses the same issue as renormalization while allowing mssp acos a higher degree of predictability in their financial forecasting.\n however, if such a cap-free model is operationally or financially infeasible, an alternative risk adjustment approach would be to raise the hcc risk adjustment cap to 5 percent while leveraging the aforementioned coding factor adjustment policy in place of renormalization. a 5 percent cap in risk scores (instead of the proposed 3 percent cap) will allow those acos that experience true increases in beneficiary acuity in excess of 3 percent the opportunity to operate under a benchmark target that is reflective of their beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 acuity. we are unfamiliar with the details behind the risk adjustment projections described in the mssp proposed rule (page 361 in the original publication); we do not know the average projected increase in hcc scores over the five- year period, nor do we know the standard deviation. however, if only 30 percent of acos are projected to have a true increase in acuity above the proposed 3 percent cap, raising the 3 percent cap to a 5 percent cap should not be overly financially averse to cms.\n\n benchmark methodology\n\n 800 n. glebe road  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  suite 500  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  arlington, virginia 22203  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  evolenthealth.com example, only one or two health systems serve large shares of beneficiaries for their region, cms should consider allowing for a higher national component to provide a more even playing field.\n\n beneficiary alignment approaches\n evolent supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow for choice between prospective or retrospective assignment for mssp acos. cms is also exploring additional ways to engage beneficiaries. these include an opt-in-based assignment methodology in which beneficiaries would elect to join an aco rather than simply designating a primary clinician, as under the current voluntary alignment process. evolent is pleased to see this increased focus on patient choice. however, it will be critical to ensure that any voluntary opt-in approaches \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether in mssp or in the forthcoming dpc model \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can be combined with attribution for acos to achieve sufficient scale. using solely beneficiary opt-in approaches would be a drastic change for acos and would require significant resources and technical assistance for success.\n in keeping this proposal one of several alignment options available to mssp acos, cms could add incentives aimed at increasing take-up of the new option and broader beneficiary engagement. for example, for those acos that choose the opt-in methodology (with or without secondary alignment), cms could provide an interest-free loan with a longer payback period, a benchmark bump of 0.5 percent or 0.75 percent or other flexibility related to benchmarks to support the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needed investments in training, outreach and enrollment efforts.\n\n expansion of waiver availability within mssp\n evolent supports the proposed expansion of waiver availability within mssp, which has benefitted next gen acos. as a principle, cms should also consider how to use waivers, and perhaps waive or modify other rules, as incentives for taking on higher levels of risk for patient outcomes and cost. further, we urge cms to add additional patient engagement tools for acos, such as allowing them to develop networks of preferred providers and to offer discounts and other incentives to patients using them. this approach could be especially helpful in engaging specialist providers in the aco.\n\n ensuring continued success of smaller and physician-led acos in mssp\n evolent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partnership model has been deployed in a variety of local health care markets throughout the united states and has generated several lessons for us and the provider organizations that we help transition to a value-based care delivery model. for example, the provision of good quality, timely data is crucial. our aco partners have also found tremendous value in evolent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk-sharing approach (i.e., sharing in upside and downside risk, akin to reinsurance mechanisms used in commercial insurance). cms should continue to allow these types of mechanisms, which ensure that all partners have \u00e2\u0080\u009cskin in the game\u00e2\u0080\u009d and strong incentives to succeed for patients and the medicare program.\n\n 800 n. glebe road  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  suite 500  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  arlington, virginia 22203  \u00e2\u0080\u00a2  evolenthealth.com spectrum, to move closer to accepting total

the health care delivery system through person- centered and market-driven approaches that empower beneficiaries as consumers and increase choices and competition to drive quality, reduce costs, and improve outcomes. we work each day to create a people-centered health system focused on delivering better health, better care, and lower costs in our communities. trinity health is committed to working with cms to promote innovative model designs and testing, including total cost of care risk models. today, approximately 25 percent or $8.5 billion of our business operates through total cost of care models, and we have set a goal of having 75 percent of our billings in value-based payment models. across our system, we serve 1.5 million patients under total cost of care contracts across all segments: medicare, medicaid and commercial risk. we are aligned with cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal of encouraging participation in models with upside potential and downside risk \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the recommendations we offer below are intended to support these shared goals.\n we view the movement to value-based care and payment as essential to advancing high-quality care, improving outcomes for medicare beneficiaries and reducing costs for the program. this is particularly important given the 2018 medicare trustees report, which projects that the hospital insurance (hi) trust fund will be exhausted in 2026 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 three years earlier than the last report.1 we commend cms for implementing and evolving the medicare shared savings program (mssp), which is a critical component of the movement to value-based care across the industry. cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 leadership has generated excitement and valuable learnings over the past five years.the industry has responded to the changes cms has led and we believe that we are much closer to having an accountable healthcare system today as a result.\n overall, we believe the accountable care organization (aco) model, as a delivery system, has effectively decreased costs and improved quality \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when supported by adequate investments. however, many providers have not made sufficient investments because of uncertainties in the program, inadequate upside opportunity, and continued concerns about fee-for-service (ffs) utilization. the current mssp approach has not driven enough investment by enough providers to fully test the aco model. some providers are merely participating today but not fully investing. as a result, the program has not delivered optimal results for the trust fund. we view this proposed rule as a real opportunity to build on the lessons learned to date and maximize trust fund savings. in order to do this, mssp should be viewed as an alternative to medicare advantage.\n our strong commitment to population-based models and the mssp is demonstrated by our six years of participation across multiple markets. we serve more than 200,000 medicare beneficiaries across the mssp and next generation aco models. to support our transformation work and ability to assume risk, we have made significant investments in - and implemented - market-specific and systemwide infrastructure and operational changes. for instance, we recently initiated systemwide implementation of the epic platform\u00e2\u0080\u0093 the largest \"single instance\" implementation effort across a health care system to date.\n in the last three years (2015-2017), trinity health has earned $31.2 million in shared savings through the mssp; additionally we earned $7 million in shared savings through the next generation aco program in 2016. the shared savings earned helped us recoup some of our initial investments and make new ones to generate additional savings and deliver high-quality care. in the past two years, most of our physician-led clinically integrated networks (cins) have transitioned their medicare acos to downside risk models. as a result, most of our medicare acos are now in a position to assume sufficient risk to qualify for basic track level e in the proposed rule and qualify for participation in an advanced alternative payment model.\n\n 3\n\n the comments we offer are informed by our experience transitioning to models that align with the more advanced levels of risk under the proposed basic and enhanced tracks. our recommendations fall into three major categories \u00e2\u0080\u0093 increasing upside opportunity for acos, aligning medicare advantage (ma) and aco program rules, and reducing regulatory burden on participating providers. we believe the comments we offer support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goals to encourage new providers to join the program, to retain existing high-performing acos, and to foster the long- term sustainability of the program.\n\n1. increasing upside opportunity to attract new and retain existing participants \n as an organization that has medicare acos in 18 physician-led cins creating value for patients and commercial, medicaid and ma payers in 22 different communities, we have substantial experience with the changes that occur when providers come together to form an aco. we have seen how changes to the care model and delivery system improve coordination across the continuum and generate tangible improvements in patient outcomes. based on our experience, we believe that if cms wants acos to assume downside risk more quickly than under the current mssp program, there must be sufficient opportunity for shared savings to support early investments in infrastructure. the upside opportunity must be sufficient enough to account for the business risk of participating in a model that does not meet the level of transparency, predictability and simplicity of other risk models such as medicare advantage. we also know that there are significant financial costs and investment risks associated with the start-up of these models. provider capacity to assume business risk for a population varies depending on the transparency, predictability, and simplicity of the financial model under a contract or program. while most of our acos are now capable of taking on advanced clinical risk and accountability, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to reduce the shared savings opportunity in the mssp \u00e2\u0080\u0093 coupled with the structure of the underlying financial model \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is likely to result in fewer participants and a less sustainable model for those remaining. during this period when we are all still learning, there is an alternative. the pathway to success includes increasing upside potential and broadening waivers. this would make it attractive to invest without undue risk. our proposal provides a stronger case for providers to lean into risk and transition to population-based models.\n trinity health recommends that 80% upside potential be available at all levels of the basic and enhanced tracks. this is necessary to level the playing field with medicare advantage, attract new providers into the program and to ensure that participating acos make the needed investments in infrastructure and operational changes to support care transformation and the ability to assume greater levels of risk over time. this will result in larger trust fund savings. trinity health urges cms to simplify the program by making all shared saving programs 80% upside, this would include the following bold changes to the proposed shared savings levels in the basic and enhanced tracks: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 basic track: levels a and b should include a shared savings rate of 80%; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 basic track: levels c and d should include a shared savings rate of 80% balanced by an increase in shared risk levels to meet advanced apm criteria; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 basic track: level e should include a shared savings rate of 80% and maintain the proposed shared risk structure; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 enhanced track: include a shared savings rate of 80% and maintain the proposed shared risk structure; and \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 enhanced track: include a full capitation model for advanced acos.\n 4\n\n invest in the care management, cehrt, and other capabilities needed to successfully manage population health and costs.\n our proposed changes to the shared risk levels under basic track levels c and d would also qualify these models as advanced apms and better prepare acos to move into the enhanced track. this would create more opportunity for physicians to participate in advanced apms and models that encourage the delivery of value-based care. we believe these changes to basic track levels c and d would require relatively minor adjustments and would help create a better business case for the aco model, and achieve cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal of increasing the number of advanced apms available to eligible clinicians.\n trinity health supports the option for all acos to choose levels of risk in the basic track upon enrollment. rather than make shared savings-only models less appealing, we urge cms to focus its efforts on making models with downside financial risk more attractive while continuing to support shared savings-only models. contracts without downside risk can result in net savings for medicare as acos gain experience. a 2016 study examined aco results between 2012-2014 and found that net savings were accruing to medicare by 2014.2 our own experience, and now research, also support that to optimize results for medicare, acos \u00e2\u0080\u0093 regardless of revenue level - should have the option to remain in basic track level a for at least three years. a recent study by naacos found that between 2013 and 2015, mssp acos achieved net savings of $542 million, but found that it takes time for quality improvement and cost reduction to occur and performance improved with time.3  under this proposal, providers are already at risk because they have only three years to position for downside risk or lose those investments and the network they have built around them when cms terminates their contract. this creates potent leverage for cms. in the most recent results on the 2017 performance year, upside only acos generated more savings per beneficiary than those bearing risk under mssp tracks 2 and 3. there is real opportunity to build on the lessons to-date and achieve larger trust fund savings.\n agreement period trinity health supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to move from three to five year contract agreement periods. we believe that longer contract agreements increase predictability and stability for providers and health systems that are making investments and other system changes to support participation. we also support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to align the contract length with other innovation center models.\n termination from program trinity health supports efforts to encourage continual quality improvement among acos. however, it is important to balance encouraging provider participation in the program with incentives to become high-performers. given that it often takes several years of participating in a model to see savings, we recommend that providers have three years to demonstrate the ability to generate savings. if at the end of that time, savings cannot be generated, cms could then terminate contracts with those participants.\n however, we ask that cms allow acos that include cpc+ to remain in upside-only tracks until cpc+ care management fees can be fully incorporated into the benchmark in order to prevent premature termination from the program for those acos simply due to program overlap. the cpc+ program fills a critical gap in advanced primary care payment models. while the cpc+ care management fees are accounted for as aco expenditures, they are not included in the historical cost base for an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark, which harms those entities that both participate as an\n 2 mcwilliams, j. michael, changes in medicare shared savings program savings from 2013 to 2014, jama, research letter, october 25, 2016. 3 mechanic,  robert, gaus, clifton, medicare shared savings program produces substantial savings: new policies should promote aco growth, health affairs, september 11, 2018.\n 5\n\n aco and are also transforming primary care practices. in any market where the vast majority of primary care providers are in cpc+, cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal will negatively impact acos. we have seen this in two of our own markets, where the cpc+ expenditures create an additional hurdle to meeting an already high msr.\n aco participation options based on high/low-revenue and prior participation we ask that cms allow high-revenue acos to remain in level e of the basic track for a second agreement period. high-revenue acos, by nature of their size and inclusion of providers across the continuum of care, are likely to have greater responsibility for care coordination across inpatient and outpatient settings than low-revenue acos. however, high-revenue acos are also better positioned to drive more appropriate care utilization across the continuum and decrease unnecessary hospital events over time. allowing high-revenue aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to remain in level e for a second agreement period would help ensure these large entities can successfully move to greater levels of risk that require systemwide investments and operational and infrastructure changes.\n as proposed, the increase in risk from level e to the enhanced track is significant. as a result, we ask that cms allow high-revenue aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to remain in level e for a second agreement period to ensure these large entities have the time needed to successfully manage the move to greater business and clinical risk. restricting the ability to remain in basic track level e for a second agreement period for high-revenue acos could lead to significant attrition of current track 1 participants.\n given that high-revenue acos are responsible for a greater share of healthcare spending than low- revenue acos, it is reasonable to ask them to assume greater levels of risk and/or at a faster pace than low-revenue acos. however, cms should also take into account that larger systems must invest in change across a much broader delivery \"footprint\" and so may require additional investments over multiple years to make transformative system changes. when making these higher investments, these acos are taking on much greater business risk and so need a longer time to recoup investments.\n high-revenue acos can include hospitals, physician groups, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies. depending on their starting point, they may require different amounts of time to successfully transform. increasing the amount of risk assumed can support alignment of incentives for the delivery of person-centered care and savings for the system; however, it also requires additional time and investment to implement changes across the care continuum. for hospitals and health systems, necessary changes are far reaching, including changes to discharge processes, transitions to nursing home care, and delivery of home-based care. additionally, care delivery transformation entails investing in cehrt across the system. for example, this year trinity health committed to implementing the largest single instance of epic in the country, an integrated platform for population health, ehr and revenue cycle systems. the goal is to enable a better care experience for the people we serve across all our markets, providing a single, comprehensive health record with seamless access to clinical and billing information. epic also aims to improve the experience for our physicians and clinicians through integrated information to improve patient care and support seamless handoffs.\n 6\n\n to move to a risk-based model. in addition, for those who have chosen a zero or low msr, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative outside the corridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d creates a double-edged sword where they are penalized for taking on more downside risk. our own experience suggests this is not sufficient and will not allow acos the opportunity to make strategic decisions regarding performance improvement which allow them to demonstrate success in future program years. as noted above, we have participated in mssp for six years and most of our acos are now in risk-bearing tracks and generating savings\u00e2\u0080\u0094demonstrating savings can be achieved, but can take a longer investment horizon.\n qualifying as an advanced apm trinity health believes apms are key to driving system transformation that improves quality and care for beneficiaries and reduces health care costs. as noted in our comments on the basic and enhanced tracks, we recommend that cms make changes to basic tracks c and d to allow them to qualify as advanced apms. in addition, many of our other recommendations, including increasing upside opportunity for basic and enhanced track acos, and allowing high- revenue acos to remain in level e for a second agreement period, will also ensure that acos remain in the program and that more join \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thereby increasing participation options in advanced apms.\n\n2. creating a level playing field between mssp acos and medicare advantage \n we believe it is critical for cms to align participation rules across the aco and medicare advantage (ma) programs to ensure a level playing field for all providers, access to care for all beneficiaries, and lower costs for the medicare program. we applaud cms for moving toward similar waiver opportunities and beneficiary assignment methodology. we offer a number of additional suggestions to align rules across the two including: \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 aligning hcc risk adjustment methodologies between the mssp and ma; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 broadening flexibility within mssp on alternate sites of care where that care can be delivered safely but is currently not allowed (e.g., infusion, hospital at home). \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 aligning care management flexibilities including determinations as to level and site of care; \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 testing value-based insurance design (vbid) features in acos as they assume greater levels of risk; and, \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 maintaining the current 70% regional adjustment in the benchmark and moving to a completely regional benchmark, which is more aligned with ma regional benchmarking.\n trinity health believes that alignment of rules between ma and acos will further allow acos to lean into risk by assuming full accountability over time. trinity health strongly advises aligning hcc risk adjustment methodologies across both aco and ma models. leveling the risk playing field between ma and acos would make the aco model more attractive to organizations willing to take on greater financial risk and therefore drive greater investment in care transformation. otherwise, the trend of organizations shifting investments solely to ma will continue. this migration from traditional medicare to ma creates a perverse outcome, driving up costs for the medicare trust fund. equalizing the hcc coding rules for ma and acos will curb provider movement toward ma only. additionally, this will curb further depletion of the trust fund, reining in overall medicare spend and slowing this transfer of wealth from taxpayers to investors.\n choice of beneficiary assignment methodology trinity health supports the ability of acos to choose either prospective or retrospective assignment. the ability to choose prospective assignment supports an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to manage care as they assume greater levels of risk. however, we support giving acos the choice as to whether they use prospective or retrospective alignment. this should be a clinical and business decision made by each aco.\n\n\n\n\n 7\n\n beneficiary \u00e2\u0080\u009copt-in\u00e2\u0080\u009d trinity health supports affirmative recognition of the relationship between a beneficiary and an aco, as this can support patient engagement and care management. however, this must be implemented in a way that reduces administrative burden. to this end, cms should explore ways to implement beneficiary opt-in in more simplified ways than early efforts through the next generation and pioneer aco programs. for example, the existing process requires managing and tracking mailings, which require financial and human resources without a substantial impact on enrollment. we ask that cms ensure that implementation of a beneficiary opt-in option not also introduce new administrative costs to acos, drawing down of funding that would otherwise support care delivery. finally, we believe beneficiary opt-in is an opportunity to align aco and ma rules. however, beneficiaries will need basic education on their choices (e.g. ma, acos, and traditional fee-for- service) from cms so they can make informed decisions about how and where to receive their care.\n waivers trinity health supports the proposed expansion of the telehealth and snf 3-day waivers, and allowing acos to provide beneficiary incentives. we also recommend that cms reduce the reporting burden related to these waivers by relying on existing claims or other available data. similarly, we recommend that cms acknowledge the investment waivers require and include when rebasing benchmarks.\n for acos to lean into greater levels or risk, additional waivers are needed that facilitate the delivery of the right care at the right time. we urge cms to make all waivers available to acos\u00e2\u0080\u0094as this will support flexibility needed to deliver high-quality, appropriate care\u00e2\u0080\u0094and build in appropriate monitoring to identify potential abuse.\n through existing waivers, aco participants have been able to better meet the needs of patients in innovative ways. however, there is uncertainty regarding the availability of particular waivers as a result of limited guidance from cms on the intended scope of, or applicability to, certain aco participants. the uncertainty has resulted in acos not choosing to opt-in to an available waiver due to concerns over noncompliance during implementation. if the expanded waivers are finalized, we urge cms to expedite regular updates to frequently asked questions (faqs) and other guidance and/or commentaries in response to aco questions. we also ask that cms and the office of the inspector general provide options for acos to request guidance regarding the applicability and implementation of waivers without having to ask for a traditional advisory opinion.\n beneficiary incentives we believe that as providers assume greater levels of risk, they should have more levers available to manage and engage patients in their care. as a result, trinity health generally supports greater flexibility to provide beneficiary incentives that facilitate greater engagement with - and care management from - a regular set of providers. however, we would encourage cms to ensure that beneficiary incentives, as described in the proposed rule, do not create an unlevel playing field among small and large acos.\n in addition to the cash-equivalent incentives described in the proposed rule, cms should consider health-related incentives such as co-pay waivers for primary care services and preventive services received within the aco such as immunizations, the medicare diabetes prevention program (mdpp), and screenings (e.g. cancer, diabetes).\n 8\n\n share learnings with newer participants and help guide future model evolution. sustainability of the program is also an important consideration \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we believe that entities should be rewarded that are historically efficient and high-performers in their market. last, retaining the current regional adjustment in the benchmark would also align the aco program with ma given the regional nature of the benchmarking and bid process in that program.\n benchmarking - risk adjustment trinity health supports the addition of a symmetrical cap on risk scores given that the health profile of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patient population is likely to change over time. the +/- 3 percent cap for the mssp aco program is also more consistent with the next generation aco program, moving closer to continuity in methodology across tracks and programs. however, extending the cap to five years will penalize acos that treat high-risk patients or that retain patients whose burden of illness increases over time.\n\n3. reducing regulatory burden \n trinity health supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal to reduce regulatory burden \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and appreciates recent initiatives, such as patients over paperwork. we also applaud the implementation of changes to the mssp program authorized by congress in the bipartisan budget act of 2018 that reduce regulatory barriers to providing person-centered care, such as expanding the use of telehealth, promoting beneficiary choice, and incenting the use of necessary primary care services.\n cms can further reduce regulatory burdens by providing greater flexibility or waivers to support the delivery of patient-centered care and services in the home. often, patients can be safely treated in the home for conditions that would meet hospital level criteria, and yet a drg can only be paid if that care is delivered in an inpatient facility. cms should remove site of service barriers to enable the administration of drugs based on clinical appropriateness, patient preference and need, rather than place of service  (e.g. permitting aco providers to perform home infusions or other supportive care when clinically safe and appropriate. trinity health also supports the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to create new collaborations between acos and standalone prescription drug plans (pdps) and to examine how part d drugs could be included in the mssp to further manage the total cost of care. these actions would also further align the program with medicare advantage.\n there is also an opportunity to minimize administrative burden and costs related to the mandatory first, face-to-face visit, beneficiary notification provision. cms can offer flexibility to acos in implementing this requirement, which would both reduce administrative costs and facilitate effective communication with beneficiaries. for instance, cms could allow practices to make a poster prominently available containing the necessary information versus a hard-copy at each patient visits; permit a degree of freedom in how this is recorded and documented from a compliance standpoint; and, provide flexibility in timing of the notification such as tying it to any visit throughout the year versus the first visit of the year.\n last, we support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to require one group practice reporting option (gpro) reporting period for 2019 and to acknowledge the aco participant list as of july 1, 2019 to determine the gpro quality reporting samples as this will reduce administrative burden for participating providers.\n minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss ratio (mlr) trinity health supports cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to allow acos to decide incremental msr based on the individual aco's risk tolerance. these options are important for individual acos to assume the level of business risk they are capable of and willing to take, based on their own business decisions.\n 9\n\n industry and cms must work together to rapidly adopt existing consensus-driven core measure sets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as cms has set out to do through the meaningful measures initiative - while working to identify the next generation of core measures. there should also be an emphasis on advancing and adopting patient-reported outcomes measures (proms), which are critical for creating a people-centered health system.\n we also support cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposed addition of opioid use measures. these efforts will support and align with our systemwide opioid use reduction (our) initiative. trinity health is committed to partnering with all stakeholders to address opioid use through prevention, intervention, treatment and recovery initiatives. a comprehensive approach to the opioid epidemic is imperative to reducing opioid harm and promoting people-centered care.\n last, while statutory changes are necessary, we reiterate the importance of aligning 42 cfr part 2 (part 2) confidentiality requirements for sharing a patient's substance use disorder records with the requirements in the health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa). unlike hipaa, part 2 does not allow for sharing or re-disclosure of identifiable substance use disorder information for treatment, payment or health care operations (\"tpo\") purposes without patient consent. moreover, part 2 requires regulated programs to provide a notice to recipients of identifiable substance use disorder information noting that the information cannot be re-disclosed. from a compliance perspective, the different standards between hipaa and part 2 have made it extremely difficult for our hospitals and health systems to know when and how this information may be shared, including within individual hospitals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 despite the importance of care coordination for individuals

however, we ask that cms make gradual increases in cehrt usage requirements in both the qpp and aco programs from 50 to 75% for advanced apm status. this is especially critical for small practices and acos with limited resources to invest in cehrt.\n overlap of other advanced apms trinity health has long been concerned about the launch of new models that overlap with existing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and population-based models- such as acos. cms must consider the overlap of the cpc+ and aco programs in particular. as previously noted, we recommend that cms allow acos that include cpc+ participants to remain in upside only tracks until cpc+ care management fees can be fully incorporated into the benchmark to prevent premature termination from the program.\n social determinants of health trinity health is committed to advancing the health of individuals and populations. we strongly believe that payment and delivery models should support addressing the social determinants of health, which research has shown drive health outcomes and costs. as cms seeks to improve the aco program, we believe this is an area where the agency can continue to work with state, regional and local stakeholders to find ways to integrate social services into care management programs. in addition, cms should examine ways to adjust payment in apms based upon sociodemographic factors to support holistic care of patients.\n 10\n\n\n \u00ef\u0082\u00b7 final reconciliation in years with these circumstances should not only mitigate shared losses, but provide parity for the msr and mlr for acos

integrated network of 150 independent providers and growing, in high need areas across the pacific northwest and alaska. our model is independent pcp centric and as a result we have been having success in commercial value-based contracts for over three years now, transforming healthcare across multiple markets. as such, the administrations proposed direction for the new aco program is a refreshing redesign of the original aco program, which had limitations in its ability to truly transform healthcare. while acos under the original program have both grown rapidly in recent years and provided a foundation to build from, the result was a consolidation of healthcare choices with mixed success. additionally, those choices are increasingly coming from a fewer number of large hospital centric healthcare systems, directing the center of care away from pcp providers who best understand their patients. hospital systems are a necessary component to transforming healthcare but will continue to struggle to achieve savings under the existing program as they have to cannibalize their most abundant revenue streams to truly achieve the types of savings desired within the aco program. the business model and financial model must be aligned to truly transform healthcare and systems without this alignment will never achieve savings unless they are otherwise at risk. this is not the case for independent pcp centric acos whose business model and financial model are aligned regardless of whether theyre at risk or not.\r\n\r\nthe proposed rule changes will truly be a pathway to success creating an environment where independent pcp providers, who have shown success in all aco tracks, can be back at the center of care without being torn between providing preventative care that results in a reduction in hospital related occurrences and loss of the financial revenue that goes along with that. the change will also stop additional unnecessary consolidation in an industry that are already lacks choices.\r\n\r\nwith the analysis performed against 2016 results, cms has empirical evidence to support the decision to redesign the program as outlined and we are supportive of the recommended changes. our experience with independent pcp centric medical groups within a clinically integrated network participating in upside only commercial value-based contracts, like those outlined in cmss pathway to success proposal, provides additional evidence that the model cms is proposing is headed in the right direction. as a result, we would like to offer a demonstration project to illustrate how this new cms model will be successful in select markets starting in january 2019.\r\n\r\nwe would start the demonstration project in the spokane, wa market extending it into the

may concern:\n the rural policy research institute health panel (panel) was established in 1993 to provide science-based, objective policy analysis to federal policy makers. the panel is pleased to offer comments in response to this particular  proposed  rule. our comments are  limited to  rural-specific  issues and  are  structured  to  parallel questions posed, or issues stated, by cms (not technical comments regarding specific sections of the proposed rule).\n overall,  the  panel supports  efforts to improve the medicare shared  savings program,  and  other  issues highlighted in this proposed rule. medicare represents a higher proportion of patients for most rural health care organizations and clinicians than in urban areas, so medicare policies may have a disproportionate impact on rural providers, hospitals, and beneficiaries. therefore, we hope our comments below serve as valuable input during the proposed rule finalization.\n the panel supports the recommendation described on page 41863, to extend the 3-day rule waver to services provided by a hospital or cah under the swing bed arrangement. doing so will facilitate better serving the needs of rural beneficiaries by providing covered services in their communities because the local provider is a cah (in the absence of a skilled nursing facility).\n 2 participation is likely to discourage participation by rural providers operating on very thin margins (e.g., critical access hospitals and rural physician alliances). we recommend cms consider a third-year at no downside risk for a defined group of providers (some characteristics or types \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maybe cah, fqhc, low revenue acos), in effect two years in level b prior to moving to c, d, and e in the basic track. we also recommend considering lowering the minimum savings ratio for those acos, and considering a downward adjustment to the maximum level of downside risk as a percent of the aco participant revenue and/or benchmark. these changes retain the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objective of accountability for total cost, but at a risk level more suitable for low revenue rural acos.\n recognizing  the  challenges  of  applying  the  aco  model  to  multiple  circumstances  (provider  types,  size  of healthcare organizations, number of beneficiaries in the market, capitalization of healthcare organizations), the  panel suggests creating  new demonstration projects to  achieve  objectives  of  lowering  costs  while achieving high quality. those demonstrations could include: (1) innovative payment models for rural providers\n(e.g., global budgeting); and (2) innovative delivery system reform models that bring clinical and non-clinical \n together in one organization model, with companion payment redesign.\n the

shared savings; accountable care organizations pathways to success. our comments are in line with those of americas essential hospitals, the association of academic medical centers and the national association of acos.\r\nthe ohio state university wexner medical center includes the college of medicine and its school of health and rehabilitation sciences; the office of health sciences, including the osu faculty group practice; various research centers, programs and institutes; the ohio state university comprehensive cancer center arthur g. james cancer hospital and richard j. solove research

osuwmcs ohio state health system managed 61,701 patient admissions; 4,989 births; 1,763,707 outpatient visits; 131,439 emergency department visits; 16,921 inpatient surgeries; and 27,169 outpatient surgeries.\r\nosuwmc is also a new medicare shared savings program (mssp) aco participant. given the early phase of our aco, the changes proposed to the mssp program in the pathways to success proposal have great importance to us.\r\nwe are supportive of several of the changes proposed in the rule, including: five year agreement periods; ability to pay for telehealth services; ability to reward patients with financial incentives\r\nadditional flexibility on choice of beneficiary assignment methodology; and expanded ability to use the existing snf 3-day rule waiver\r\nhowever, we have several concerns with the rule as written, including: 1.the shortened time period for acos to be in shared savings only mode; 2. the reduce shared savings rate from 50% to 25%\r\n3. the risk adjustment cap being limited to 3 percent over 5 years\r\nthe rule allows too little time for an aco to be in the shared savings only mode. we believe the upside only risk period should be up to five years, with at least three years guaranteed. an aco should also be able to earn an additional two years of upside risk only based on performance.\r\nthe initial three year period would allow new acos one year for planning and two years of operational experience. our position of at least three years of upside risk only is supported by the september 21st health affairs blog post by mark mcclellan and his associates. they note that evidence demonstrates that that organizations more likely need three years of only upside risk before an aco surpasses the learning curve. https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180920.604462/full/\r\nfurther, two years aligns with robert mechanics suggestions in his september 11th health affairs blog entry (https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180906.711463/full/. he recommends that acos should have an opportunity for an additional two years of upside risk only if they meet specified savings and quality goals during the first three years.\r\nsecond, the shared savings rate should remain at 50%. the 25% savings rate does not reflect the need for new aco entrants to be able to recoup their investment costs. as robert mechanic notes in his september 11th health affairs blog analysis running an aco requires new clinical and administrative personnel, data systems and analytics and investment in developing new clinical protocols and workflows. all of this work comes at a cost that the aco bears entirely. these costs provided by the aco are actually a form of risk sharing by the aco.\r\nfinally, cms should raise the hcc risk adjustment cap to at least 5% over 5 years. the proposed rule has an aggregate 3% limit over five years in recognizing changes in beneficiaries risk scores when calculating benchmarks. this rate is the same as it was when agreements were three years in length, not the five year length recommended in the rule. this longer agreement time period comes with a greater likelihood that the health of beneficiaries will change simply as a result of the aging process. therefore, with the increase in the agreement period should come a higher limit for changes in risk scores, allowing risk scores to vary by up to at least 5 percent.\r\nosuwmc is excited to be participating in the mssp aco program. recent studies demonstrate current mssp acos are creating both direct and indirect savings. these acos are the type of market place innovations that are at the core of secretary azars vision.\r\nwhile we support having mssp acos take on more risk

region, we appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) medicare shared savings program (mssp) pathways to success proposed rule.\n avera appreciates cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued commitment to accountable care organizations (acos). medicare acos have been successful in reducing health care costs and improving quality. the recent mssp pathways to success proposed rule estimates that the overall impact of acos, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cspillover effects\u00e2\u0080\u009d on medicare spending outside of the aco program, lowered spending by $1.8 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $4.2 billion (0.5\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 1.2 percent) in 2016 alone. additionally, when assessing the counterfactual, comparing acos \n performance in comparison to what medicare spending would have otherwise been, acos estimate savings are approximately 2 percent higher1. for example, peer-reviewed studies found that the mssp saved more than $200 million in 2013 and 2014 and $144.6 million in 2015 after accounting for shared savings bonuses earned by acos2. a similar study found that acos saved $1.84 billion from 2013 through 2015 and reduced medicare spending by $542 million after accounting for shared savings bonuses3. avera firmly believes that the aco model is a successful approach for encouraging providers to work together to reduce costs and improve the quality of healthcare for medicare beneficiaries.\n supporting the movement to these value-based payment models goes beyond the quality and financial results of acos. from a market perspective, we will never achieve innovation in healthcare except through the creative power of healthcare providers seeking to innovate the care delivery\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 2 of 13\n\n process. models in which payers seek to achieve savings and quality improvement will always fall short until healthcare providers themselves are held accountable for the results. we have seen firsthand the remarkable innovations that are spurred by this accountability such as those in telehealth, the hospital in the home, special care centers, organizing community support organizations and systematically addressing the social determinates of health.\n the pathways to success establishes a step-wise approach for acos increasingly taking on more downside risk. avera agrees that it is imperative that over time providers become increasingly responsible for total cost of care through risk-bearing agreements; however, cms must ensure providers have proper tools and experience to achieve this vision. we believe that with proper incentives and improvements in the program organizations will take on risk, seeing the quality, clinical innovation and business benefit from doing so. specifically, cms should consider the following within the context of mssp and any new payment models:\n sufficient time in an upside-only model prior to moving to downside risk. acos are more likely to achieve shared savings with time. specifically, studies show that the shared savings rate doubles with three years of experience from 21 percent for acos in the first year to over 40 percent for acos in the third of fourth year4. accordingly, avera recommends at least 3 years in an upside only model for new acos entering the mssp. beyond the mssp program, avera believes it is imperative for cms to provide a long-term vision and roadmap for the transition to value-based and risk-based models. in the absence of a clear timeline, some providers are reluctant to embark on new models. when providers have a clear plan for moving to new models (e.g. the maryland all-payer model), providers work aggressively to succeed in the model and more rapidly advance to the risk-bearing model.\n high performers should be encouraged to participate in models regardless of provider type. the mssp performance data summarizes average aco performance, masking differences among high and low performers within each category. we strongly discourage the application of policies targeting provider types that are intended to modify the behavior of the lowest performers; these policies impact high and low performers, thereby disincentivizing high performers from continuing in the model and producing savings. specifically, we request that cms eliminate the distinction of high and low revenue acos and avoid creating new blunt tools to define acos (e.g. physician-led and hospital-led). in any payment model cms should create a level competitive playing field and let those that perform best succeed most. cms should find non-provider defined approaches to eliminate poor performers.\n ensure a business case for taking on risk. cms must ensure that acos and new payment models, particularly voluntary models, provide incentives for taking on risk. the existing models to date have ignored the significant investment costs required to start or continue participation in a model. even when these costs are not incorporated into the payment model, providers will consider potential return on investment when determining whether to enter a new model. cms must recognize this dynamic and ensure that acos and other models will attract providers. specifically, cms should:\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 increase the shared savings rate for acos to at least 50 percent. as discussed below reducing the savings rate prevents acos from recouping initial investments, reinvesting savings into population health activities, and recruiting providers with the use of gainsharing agreements.\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 3 of 13\n\n\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 provide additional flexibility in the models for acos taking on risk. to be best suited to take on more risk, within an aco or any payment mode, and effectively manage the care of populations providers require flexibility. while beneficial, the current approaches to providing flexibility (e.g. snf and telehealth waivers, beneficiary incentive program) represent limited portions of medicare benefits and thus limited opportunities for transforming care. within the next generation aco model cms incorporated several options that provide flexibility and should be considered for inclusion in the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0094choice on enrolling tin or npi, infrastructure payment, prepayment of shared savings and primary capitation.\n redesigning participation options to facilitate performance-based risk\n phase-in of performance-based risk in the basic track cms proposes to redesign the mssp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance-based risk tracks by retiring track 1 (no risk, upside only) and track 2 and creating a new basic track. in the basic track, participants could begin participation in a one-sided risk model and phase-in risk over the course of a single agreement period; the highest level of risk is comparable to the current track 1+. additionally, the proposed rule retains track 3, renaming it as the enhanced track. eligible acos would enter into these two tracks for an agreement period of 5 years (the first agreement period, if stated in july 2019 would be 5 years and 6 months). within the basic track, cms proposes a glide path that includes 5 levels: a one-sided risk model available only for the first two consecutive performance years (levels a & b), and three levels of progressively higher risk and potential reward in performance years 3 through 5 of the agreement period (levels c, d, and e). acos would automatically advance at the start of each participation years along this glide path until they reach the track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maximum level of risk/reward (designed to be the same as the track 1+ model).\n avera supports an agreement period of at least 5 years, as we believe that this adds stability to the program. we have serious concerns, however, that the progression cms proposes to two-sided risk in the basic track is far too aggressive and will deter participation in the mssp. we believe that the two years in a one-sided risk model is insufficient for acos to prepare for moving to downside risk. numerous studies show that acos require about 3-4 years to become successful.5 this is not surprising given that acos receive feedback on their performance several months into their first agreement period\u00e2\u0080\u0095any initiatives designed to improve performance always take more time than anticipated, and this is particularly true for the complex organizations and agreements that comprise an aco. organizations need time to make the structural, cultural, and practice changes required to successfully manage and assume financial risk for a population. in recognition of the time required for acos to be successful, cms should allow at least three years of no-downside risk within the basic track to ensure the success of participating acos and encourage future participation. cms should extend an optional fourth year in a one-sided track for acos that achieve savings, not necessarily shared savings, and have high quality.\n shared savings rate avera strongly urges cms to set the entry-level risk for the basic track at 50 percent with gradual increases in the shared-savings rate as acos progress through the various levels. lowering the shared-\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 4 of 13\n\n savings rate for acos with no downside risk from 50 percent to 25 percent provides little incentive for new acos to join the program. the low shared-savings rate also does not consider the substantial investment needed on the part of acos. according to an analysis by the aha, the investment required to put in place and sustain the elements necessary for a successful aco has been $11.6 to $26.1 million higher than previous estimates by cms. these costs, coupled with the cost of having a repayment mechanism in place to cover losses, creates a high hurdle for organizations who are transitioning to accountable care.\n the proposed shared savings rate is a significant decrease for existing acos, which will be unable to reinvest savings back into population management and care coordination. shared savings payments are critical as part of an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transformation toward value-based care and are necessary to incentivize providers to make the infrastructure investments needed to transform care delivery and processes. without them, acos will struggle to provide care and services needed to appropriately manage the health of the population and move more rapidly to risk, undermining the overall goal of the program. reducing shared savings also produces problems with provider participation and aco buy-in, as some organizations already find this difficult at current shared savings level. to incentivize acos to take on risk, cms should increase the shared-savings rates as acos take on additional risk. we recommend increasing the shared savings by 5 percent with each step: levels a/b: 50 percent; levels c/d: 55 percent; and level e: 60 percent.\n calculation of loss sharing limit avera supports using the lower of the revenue-based or historical benchmark for calculation of the loss sharing limit. however, we recommend that cms align the risk level for track e with the nominal risk threshold for apm models established under the qpp, which is 3 percent of the historical benchmark, rather than the 4 percent cms proposes. cms provides no rationale for setting the benchmark-based loss limit at the nominal risk standard plus one percentage point. the purpose of track e is to provide aco entities with a more gradual pathway to risk, while also meeting the requirements of an aapm. setting the historical-benchmark at a higher level would disproportionately affect acos with hospital participants and subject them to additional risk as they will always use the historical-based benchmark since medicare part a and b revenue will far exceed the historic-based benchmark. accordingly, increasing the benchmark-based loss limit creates an unlevel playing field for acos that include hospital participants this proposed policy is counter to the goal of acos to encourage providers to work together to improve care for beneficiaries and discourages both health-system led and physician-led acos from recruiting hospital participants.\n cms should allow all acos to remain in track e or whatever track meets the nominal risk requirements under qpp. if cms increases the qpp aapm nominal risk threshold, cms should create a glidepath in mssp for acos to transition to the new standard of risk.\n transition from level e to enhanced track\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 5 of 13\n\n tracks. to further maximize interest in acos transitioning to the enhacned track, cms should start the shared savings rate to 80 percent (same as the next generation aco program) and increase the maximum shared savings and losses rate over the agreement period.\n permitting annual participation elections\n annual risk election cms proposes to allow acos in the basic track to more rapidly transition (i.e., skip a level or levels) during the agreement period, but level e must be entered into no later than the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth performance year under cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal. premier encourages cms to provide acos with more flexibility in their annual participation elections. if an aco selects a higher level of risk than it would have been automatically assigned, it should not be required to automatically advance the following year (i.e. an aco is not required to advance beyond the track they would have been assigned if they did not choose to advance to a higher track). as noted earlier, acos require additional time moving to risk. this option would provide acos the option to gain experience in a limited risk track for more than one year. additionally, we ask that cms consider allowing high performing acos more than one year in limited risk tracks (i.e. level c and d); cms could set parameters for successful acos to continue in a particular track prior to automatic advancing (i.e. achieving savings, not necessarily shared savings, and high quality).\n annual election of beneficiary assignment in alignment with the bipartisan budget act of 2018, cms proposes to allow all acos with a choice of prospective assignment for the agreement periods beginning july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years. as proposed, acos would also be able to change its beneficiary assignment methodology through the annual election process.  avera disagrees with this proposal, due to our concern that the attribution of patients to an aco, who designate a provider through mycms.gov without maintaining, at a minimum, the criteria of an established relationship between that patient and the provider creates an unreasonable expectation in terms of the ability to manage both patient conditions and cost utilization.\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 6 of 13\n\n provider, unfairly pushes the burden of cost and quality onto aco providers, regardless of an actual relationship, which is counter to the primary purpose.\n determining participation options based on medicare ffs revenue and prior participation\n cms proposes to define participation options by making a distinction between low revenue acos and high revenue acos. high revenue acos are a proxy for acos that typically include a hospital billing through an aco participant tin; cms defines this as an aco whose total part a and b revenue for aco participants is greater than the total parts a and b expenditures for aco assigned beneficiaries. acos falling below this threshold are considered low-revenue acos, a proxy for physician group acos. cms believes that high revenue acos are more capable of accepting higher risk than low revenue acos. cms provides fewer participation options for high revenue acos. high revenue acos with \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d can only participate in the enhanced track regardless of whether they are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cre- entering\u00e2\u0080\u009d the program. in addition, low revenue (and inexperienced) acos may operate under the basic track for a maximum of two agreement periods, whereas high revenue acos are limited to one agreement period.\n avera strongly opposes this proposal and urges cms to eliminate the low/high revenue distinction for determining participation options. we firmly believe that all acos should the treated the same. this proposed distinction is unnecessary and harmful, as it would discourage acos that have the potential to generate substantial savings to the program from participating. the premise cms uses for hospital-led versus physician-led distinction is also flawed. cms argues that this policy decision is due in part to low revenue acos producing 2 percent of savings compared to 0.2 percent for high-revenue acos. an analysis, completed by premier healthcare alliance, of hospital-led vs. physician-led acos revealed two- major findings that refute this assumption: their analysis of cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 definition of hospital-led (the aco includes a hospital tin participant) found that it is inaccurate with at least 20 percent of health system- led acos being designated as \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysician led.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  some of the highest performing individual acos are hospital-led acos.  additionally, as cms is aware, the intent of acos is to align providers, hospitals, clinics, post-acute and home care professionals to better coordinate care, improve quality, and lower cost. carving physicians out of these collaborative practices is counterproductive to the goals of this program.\n cms argues that many low-revenue acos are not well-capitalized and therefore unable to absorb losses as well as high-revenue acos. regardless of structure, significant investments are needed in population health platforms and care process changes for acos to bear risk. medicare revenue is also not indicative of ability to bear risk. cms is unable to identify if an aco is well capitalized through sources outside of medicare revenue (i.e., insurer or investor backed acos). accordingly, cms is unable to truly identify whether an aco is well capitalized and thus should not create distinctions based on assumptions about capital. setting up a system that disadvantages hospital-led acos limits the types of innovations needed to build a high performing healthcare system for the range of communities across the nation.\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 7 of 13\n\n break down the artificial silos that cause duplicative, fragmented patient care. acos do not drive physician employment, but rather, acos support greater clinical integration and collaboration among doctors, hospitals and other care providers and align the payment system to incent coordination and cost savings across these silos. this alignment accomplishes what the model is designed to do, and what providers need out of high-value networks, without necessitating employment of physicians. some of the most effective acos in our nation engage a majority of independent clinicians. the greatest fear related to consolidation is its potential to lead to higher prices. ultimately, the only way to protect against escalating costs is to advance these alternative payment models that hold providers accountable and give them the opportunity to improve care and reduce costs for an entire population.\n avera believes that the goal of acos is to incent all providers to work collaboratively to benefit patients. the best way to drive high quality care for patients is to create incentives that drive all the providers in a system to collaborate, to innovate, and deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare. including a hospital is an effective way to balance the need for access to specialty care while increasing the focus on primary care. one might argue that an aco should require a hospital participant and other providers across the care continuum to ensure that acos do not simply keep patients away from a particular setting but ensure patients receive care in the least restrictive setting. while it would be absurd to define what providers an aco must include it is equally absurd to say that acos that work to include multiple provider types should be forced to risk sooner.\n avera believes that healthy market competition relies on a level playing field. this administration has been outspoken in advocating for market solutions and level playing fields among competitors.  this proposed policy, however, is contrary to a market-based approach whereby all competitors have similar opportunities for success. whenever there is an uneven playing field, one competitor will use it to their advantage over another.  alternatively, competitors can take steps to game the system.  advantaging one group over another can also create perverse incentives to undermine a competitor overall.\n defining participation options by \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cms also proposes to limit participations options by categorizing acos as \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cinexperienced\u00e2\u0080\u009d with performance-based risk medicare aco initiatives and determining participation options based on prior participation of aco legal entity and aco participants. cms defines a \u00e2\u0080\u009cre- entering aco\u00e2\u0080\u009d as (1) the same legal entity as an aco, identified by tin, or a (2) new legal entity that has never participated in the mssp and is applying to participate in the program and more than 50 percent of its aco participants were included on the aco participant list. cms defines an experienced aco that meets either of the following criteria: (1) the aco is the same legal entity as a current or previous aco that is participating in, or has participated in, a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or that deferred its entry into a second mssp agreement period under track 2 or track 3; or (2) 40 percent or more of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participants participated in a performance-based risk medicare aco initiative, or in an aco that deferred its entry into a mssp agreement period under track 2 or track 3, in any of the 5 most recent performance years prior to the agreement start date.\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 8 of 13\n\n an appeals process. for example, it is possible that two separate acos discontinue operation in a region then a new entity, completely unaffiliated with either prior entity, forms in the region and recruits participants involved in the prior organization. the intent of the policy is to avoid gaming of the options for the glidepath not to discourage new entities. to balance this potential outcome, cms should also consider a second criterion, setting a threshold for a percentage of participants that previously were in the same entity. for example, cms would first identify if 50 percent of participants would qualify aco to be reentering or experienced; then if less than 30 percent of participants were part of the same legal entity then the aco could appeal the label of reentering or experienced.\n monitoring for financial performance\n cms proposes additional provisions to address an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial performance when an aco may otherwise be in compliance with program requirements. cms states that just as poor quality performance can subject an aco to remedial action or termination, an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to lower growth in medicare ffs expenditures should be the basis for cms to take pre-termination actions. these actions could include a request for corrective action by the aco, or termination of the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement. specifically, cms proposes to terminate acos if it is negative outside corridor for two agreement periods. cms appears to be particularly concerned about one-sided risk acos that continue to participate in the program and generate net losses to medicare.\n avera opposes the cms proposal to terminate acos if negative outside corridor for two agreement periods. we believe that these additional provisions, if implemented, would provide cms with too much discretion to terminate aco participation in the program. we are concerned that such unchecked authority provided to cms would further discourage acos participating in the mssp, as this would create additional uncertainty for participants and would also make it difficult to establish agreements with other organizations. moreover, cms proposals with respect to the glide path that would limit participation in one-sided risk models would also provide acos with incentives to leave the program if they were not able to generate savings.\n election of minimum savings rate (msr)/minimum loss rate (mlr) by acos\n cms proposes that acos under the basic track would have the same msr/mlr options that are currently available to acos under one-sided and two-side models of the mssp. acos under the basic track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glide path in level a or level b would choose the msr/mlr to be applied before the start of their first performance year in a two-sided model. cms also proposes to use a variable msr/mlr when performing shared savings and shared losses if an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned beneficiary population falls below 5,000 for the performance year, regardless of whether the aco selected a fixed or variable msr/mlr. avera supports these proposals and appreciates the flexibility these options provide to meet acos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs.\n participation options for agreement periods beginning in 2019\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 9 of 13\n\n 30, 2019. cms notes that this election to extend the agreement period is voluntary and an aco could therefore conclude its participation in the program with the expiration of its current agreement period on december 31, 2018.\n avera is concerned that this policy will result in an aco managing the costs and quality of two separate beneficiary populations. each six-month performance period has two distinct assignment windows and methodologies. moreover, if an aco changes its participant lists between the six-month extension and the start of the new model, the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aligned beneficiaries could be significantly different. while some beneficiaries will be attributed to the aco for both performance periods, there will be a portion of an acos beneficiary that are attributed for only one performance period. for beneficiaries attributed for only the first performance period, the aco will have to continue to deploy resources to manage this population after they are no longer aligned with the aco and the aco is unable to take advantage of the waivers available in the program. for beneficiaries attributed only in the second performance period, the aco will be responsible for costs incurred in the first half of the year when the aco had no ability to manage the beneficiaries care.\n managing two distinct patient populations will require the aco to be responsible for the beneficiaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cost and quality during a time in which the aco is unable to manage the patient. as a result, acos will have to scale up resources and infrastructure for one performance period in order to mitigate the quality and cost impact. moreover, with little influence over beneficiaries expenditures outside of the performance period acos could potentially be at risk for exceeding their benchmark. to mitigate this impact, cms should provide an option to allow acos in current models to extend their agreements for one year, resulting in a start date of january 1, 2020 for entering the new model. cms could still provide a july 1, 2019 start date option for new and existing acos. at a minimum, cms should use a singular assignment window and methodology to determine the assigned population for the entire calendar year 2019, regardless of whether they are in an extended agreement or the new model.\n finally, we are concerned that implementation issues could arise if cms rushes the application process, so we urge cms to ensure that there is enough time for cms and participants to prepare for an application cycle after the final rule. avera asks that cms delay the july 1, 2019 start and offer a one- year extension to all current acos who are ending their agreements if cms is not ready to implement a new model.\n benchmarking methodology refinements\n risk adjustment methodology\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 10 of 13\n\n enhanced track should align with the percentage change in risk scores for ma plans.\n use of regional factors when establishing and resetting aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmarks\n cms proposes to incorporate regional expenditures into the benchmarking methodology for acos in a first agreement period for all acos entering the program beginning on july 1, 2019 and in subsequent years. under current policy, the maximum weight applied to the regional adjustment is 70 percent. cms proposes policies that would limit the magnitude of the adjustment by reducing the weight (to a maximum of 50 percent) and imposing an absolute dollar limit on the adjustment (capped at 5 percent of the national per capita expenditures for parts a and b services in baseline year 3 for assignable beneficiaries).\n avera is concerned that these regional adjustments do not accurately adjust rural-based health care systems. these adjustments are based on the assumption that risk is evenly distributed. however in rural counties, typically only one health care system present is present, access to care is often with an advanced practice provider, and physician visits occur primarily through a specialist. these factors cause the majority of an attributable population for a rural county is beneficiaries that have accessed a specialist, which makes for a more complex and costly population. this complex population is skewed to the lone health care system, offering access to specialties in the region, while the remainder of the population, which is relatively healthy and low cost, is not attributed because they have not had a physician visit. as such, avera requests that cms: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 expand the definition of region beyond the local county level to include nearby markets where physician access is more distributed; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 exclude rural areas from regional adjustments.\n\n fee-for-service benefit enhancements\n skilled nursing facility (snf) 3-day rule waiver expansion\n currently, the snf 3-day rule waiver can be requested only by those mssp acos that bear performance-based risk and to whom beneficiaries are prospectively assigned.  cms proposes to expand the waiver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s applicability beginning july 1, 2019, to include performance-risk bearing acos that utilize preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment.  in all cases, the snf must be an eligible affiliate of the aco and, in most cases, have a rating of 3 stars or better in the cms five-star snf quality rating system.  (cms also is proposing to allow swing bed operators, who are not included in the star rating system, to become eligible snf affiliates.)  the waiver is available currently to track 3 and track 1+ acos; the proposed expansion would include track 2, basic track levels c, d, and e and the enhanced track.  avera strongly supports the proposed expansion of snf 3-day rule waiver applicability as another important tool with which acos can more effectively coordinate care while increasing quality and reducing unnecessary costs.\n telehealth waiver expansion\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 11 of 13\n\n telehealth services are furnished to ffs beneficiaries by mssp aco professionals.  the waiver would take effect beginning with performance year 2020 and be limited to those acos that bear performance- based risk and to whom beneficiaries are prospectively assigned.  the services must be billed through the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tin and may not be designated as inpatient-only. the expanded telehealth policy would apply to track 3 and to track 1+ acos as well as to those on the newly proposed enhanced track and on levels c, d, and e of the basic track.  avera strongly supports the telehealth expansion as proposed, particularly when combined with the increased flexibility that would occur with the proposed ability for acos to annually elect either prospective or preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment.\n other needed waivers\n avera notes once again that additional waivers are critical to removing persistent legal and regulatory barriers that inhibit mssp aco providers from working together to provide better-coordinated, high- quality care, most notably pertaining to the applicable fraud and abuse laws (e.g., the stark and anti- kickback statutes and the beneficiary inducements civil monetary penalty (cmp) provisions).  avera continues to recommend that cms should issue: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an aco \u00e2\u0080\u009cpre-participation\u00e2\u0080\u009d waiver to protect aco-related start-up arrangements, in anticipation of new mssp participants and the proposed redesigned tracks; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an aco participation waiver that applies broadly to aco-related arrangements during the term of the participation agreement; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 a shared savings distributions waiver that applies to distributions and uses of any earned shared savings payments or internal costs savings.\n\n tools to strengthen beneficiary engagement\n opt-in assignment methodology\n cms discusses at length and invites comments about all aspects of a hybrid assignment methodology that would include direct aco opt in (a beneficiary chooses assignment to a specific aco); voluntary alignment with an aco professional (with resulting assignment to the aco in which that professional participates); and a modification of the current claims-based assignment methodology (incorporating a minimum level of primary care visits furnished to a beneficiary).  cms does not make any formal proposal about the hybrid methodology nor indicate a timeline for further consideration of its implementation.\n in general, avera is concerned about any additional cost and administrative burdens placed on providers and practices due to further mandates, especially those that do not improve quality for beneficiaries.\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 12 of 13\n\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 expeditiously test an option for beneficiary opt-in directly to an aco (in parallel to the existing beneficiary voluntary alignment directly to an aco professional). testing should explore appropriate marketing opportunities for acos analogous to those for ma plans \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 explore additional approaches hybrid assignment and choose one or more for limited-scale testing before proposing any program-wide replacement mssp assignment methodology, cms should explore rules for rejecting opt-in or voluntary assignment (e.g. when a beneficiary resides outside the geographic region, when a beneficiary does not receive at least one service from a participating provider in the aco).\n updating program policies\n voluntary alignment policy revisions\n medicare ffs beneficiaries may choose to designate an aco professional as their primary clinician for coordinating their care, and the beneficiary who does so becomes voluntarily aligned to the designated professional\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aco.  currently, a primary clinician must be either a primary care practitioner or practice one of a limited list of specialties (e.g., cardiology), and the beneficiary must have received at least one primary care service from a professional who practices primary care or a listed specialty in the aligned\naco.  as part of bba 2018 implementation, cms proposes policy revisions to begin with performance \n year 2019 including removing the specialty restrictions to primary clinician eligibility and no longer requiring the voluntarily aligned beneficiary to have received any services from a professional in the aligned aco during the applicable beneficiary assignment window.  avera supports the removal of specialty restrictions for primary clinicians but recommends retention of the requirement for a beneficiary to receive at least one primary care service from an aco participant\n revised definitions of primary care for use in beneficiary assignment\n in accordance with provisions of the 21st century cures act and bba 2018, for performance years 2019 and thereafter, cms proposes to update the definition of primary care services that is used when assigning beneficiaries to acos (in combination with the applicable mssp track\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assignment methodology).  services that would satisfy the revised definition include some existing current procedural terminology (cpt) codes (e.g., advance care planning) and healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) g-codes (e.g., depression screening) along with new g-codes proposed elsewhere in the rule (e.g., complexity inherent in office visits for certain specialties). cms also proposes to more accurately distinguish short-term, rehabilitation-related evaluation and management services provided in nursing facilities from ongoing primary care services furnished to longer-term nursing facility residents.  cms would identify the former services by linking the appropriate cpt codes to nursing facility claims for the same dates of service rather than relying on the place of service code for snfs (code 31) as listed on the professional claim.  avera supports the changes as proposed and agrees with cms that linking snf facility claims by date of service to

interoperability (pi)\n\nms. seema verma \n\noct. 16, 2018 \n page 13 of 13\n\n through two actions that would become effective january 1, 2019: 1) retiring the aco-11 measure (use of certified electronic health record technology (cehrt)); and 2) requiring instead certification by each aco that the level of cehrt usage by the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clinicians meets or exceeds the advanced apm cehrt threshold under the qpp.  the latter requirement would become a condition of participation for all mssp tracks, and all payment models within those tracks, that also meet the financial risk standard required of advanced apms.  avera supports both of these proposed actions regarding aco cehrt usage and appreciates the associated burden reduction for acos and their clinicians.  however, the first change as proposed could potentially create disparate scoring standards for the promoting interoperability category in mips for aco clinicians that are not an advanced apm or do not meet the thresholds to be considered a qualifying participant. while the aco requirement is that clinicians would only have to certify cehrt usage, the mips requirement would require clinicians to actually submit pi data for scoring using mips-apm scoring standard.  avera requests that cms avoid creating confusion by confirming that clinicians in acos that are mips apms would not be subject to full pi category reporting and scoring but instead could simply certify their cehrt usage.  the pi category weight for such clinicians would then be redistributed equally to the quality and clinical practice improvement activities performance categories.\n in closing, avera appreciates the opportunity to submit these comments on the medicare shared savings program pathways to success proposed rule. we look forward to working with you on these and other issues that continue to challenge and strengthen our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care. if you have any questions about these comments or need

achieving shared savings, or even to help discourage the least such amenable beneficiaries from remaining with a clinician/aco from one performance year to the next. we believe that such practices would be inevitable under a opt-in model, would inevitably undermine the core goals of the mssp, and therefore the proposal should be withdrawn indefinitely. should cms decide to move forward with some kind of opt-in assignment scheme, it should extend the same courtesy to acos and permit them to utilize this methodology voluntarily, and develop safeguards to prevent opt-in based acos from \"poaching\" patients from competing acos with non-care driven tactics. beneficiary engagement beneficiary notifications cms proposes several changes to the requirement that acos notify their assigned beneficiaries of their participation in the mssp, and proposes to strengthen beneficiaries ability to voluntarily align themselves with an aco by designating an aco-participating clinician as their primary care provider, as required under section 50331 of the bipartisan budget act of 2018 (`the act\").1\u00e2\u00b0  consistent with the act, cms proposes to reintroduce the annual requirement that an aco-participating clinician provide beneficiaries with a notification (to be provided by cms as a template form) at their first primary care visit of each performance year, explaining the program and the beneficiary's rights as a participant, including to voluntarily align with an aco by designating a participating clinician as responsible for their care (including a physician/aco other than the one providing the notification). this new requirement would be in addition to current requirements to post signs and have written notices available upon request. bjc urges cms to withdraw this proposal for the same reasons the original annual notification requirement was eliminated the first lime (in 2015)\u00e2\u0080\u0094it only creates more confusion for patients and unnecessary burden for providers, even with, or perhaps more so because of, cms's template language!' bjc recommends that cms instead revise 42 cfr 425.312(c) to remove the designation of these notices as \"marketing materials,\" and instead permit acos to communicate basic mssp information to their beneficiaries in whatever manner seems most appropriate, including the already required posters and on-demand notices. cms should undertake its own efforts to educate medicare beneficiaries on the mssp generally, including their right to voluntarily align with an aco (or not). at the very least, cms should just leave the current notification standards in place. beneficiary incentive payments pursuant to section 50341 of the act, cms proposes to permit certain acos to establish a beneficiary incentive payment program, whereby acos would pay their beneficiaries a nominal amount for engaging in certain qualifying activities!' as cms notes, several anti-kickback statute (\"aks\") and physician self-referral ('stark\") exceptions and safe harbors have been made for the mssp, including as relates to patient inducement!' in particular, the bjc aco, llc recently began making use of the \"in-kind items and services\" exception to distribute scales and glucose monitors in accordance with the requirements of 42 cfr 425.304(a)(2). similar waivers have been in place, and in use by mssp participants, since the beginning of the program in performance year 2013. we are not aware of any significant negative repercussions for the mssp or cms more broadly, suggesting that extending those waivers to include i\u00e2\u00b0 see discussion beginning at 83 fr 41874, proposing to modify 42 cfr 425.312. the bipartisan budget act of 2018 is public law 115-123, available here:

of smith county and the surrounding area in north central kansas. this facility maintains equipment and personnel required to provide service to the residents of this very rural area, regardless of the illness or injury they may be suffering from. because of the rural nature of the facility, we maintain accreditation as a level iv trauma center, as well as preparedness to treat medical emergencies such as heart attacks, strokes, and other life-threatening emergencies. we also provide obstetrical services. the nearest referral hospital for trauma (a level ii trauma center) is 75

than 200 miles away.\ngreat plains of smith county has collaborated with the kansas clinical improvement collaborative (kcic) as a track i mssp aco. jointly with kcic and its affiliated providers, we have entered into clinical improvement strategies to assure the highest quality of care possible for residents of our service area. while we believe there is great benefit to collaborating with clinical partners to improve the quality of care, we must be stewards of the resources required to pay for those services. residents of rural areas contribute, through tax support, a greater level of financial support than residents of more urban areas. participating in the mssp has assisted with achieving greater financial stability for this hospital. there is considerable concern, however, that elimination of the shared savings-only model will either require additional local tax resources or force the elimination of our participation just as we are beginning to see the benefits of the collaborative approach.\nif the proposed change in the mssp model would require kcic to accept downside risk, the continued participation of gpsc in the program would be severely threatened. we would

than 30,000 employees and our relationships with more than 290 physician clinics, 38 hospitals in metropolitan and rural communities and 15 home health agencies throughout our 9 regions, uph provides

page 2\n executive summary: medicare advantage (ma) plus proposal\n the ma plus model is a proposal submitted to the cms innovation center that is designed to be the future of medicare service delivery. built upon the popular ma chassis, this provider integrated model seeks to promote the delivery of high-quality care to medicare beneficiaries and promote economic efficiency in the medicare program. the model respects the provider-patient relationship, offers a superior beneficiary experience as designed by providers and their patients, and removes barriers to delivering care that is high-quality, convenient, requested and timely.\n\n need\n medicare costs are a growing percentage of the federal budget. congress and regulators have mandated that the healthcare industry move to value and increasingly tie payment to quality and health outcomes.\n providers are overwhelmed with increasing healthcare regulations and desire to move to a stable payment environment. seniors in rural areas and elsewhere want affordable access to healthcare and fear reductions in coverage.\n\n solution\n the medicare advantage program is an increasingly popular option for seniors and has shown promise in curbing costs, quality outcomes and offering supplemental benefits desired by seniors. medicare aco models have succeeded in offering a differentiated patient experience through enhanced provider engagement and testing benefit enhancements and programmatic waivers. by further enabling ma with aco best practices, the ma plus model will enhance healthcare access, provide high-quality care and offer fiscal relief to the medicare program. the model prioritizes choice in healthcare, encourages marketplace competition and assists the government by lessening its role in healthcare administration.\n\n the ma plus model is proposed as a five-year pilot. model features include:\n\n e = eligibility limited to provider integrated ma plans, which require collaboration with a medicare aco and meaningful provider representation on the plan\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u0096s governing body.\n\n e \u00e2\u0094\u00ac\u00e2\u00ba=6attribution-based enrollment of beneficiaries related to their alignment with medicare acos is utilized with affirmative election to remain in fee-for-service medicare.\n\n e network adequacy requirements will allow alternative high-quality standards for tele-health and center of excellence designations.\n\n e the ma program will serve as the chassis \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 current ma payment rates and regulatory structure, except as to enrollment methodology and as otherwise defined in the proposal.\n\n e tailored beneficiary communication strategy and outreach related to plan benefits, cost and enrollment process will be implemented. marketing to non-attributed aco beneficiaries is prohibited.\n\n e acorisk scores for enrolled members will be utilized for the ma plus plan in initial years.\n\n executive summary: medicare advantage (ma) plus proposal\n e quality performance will be measured under the ma star measurement and rating system, with initial plans deemed as 3-star plans unless heightened aco quality performance merits a 4-star rating.\n\n e regulatory flexibility and applicable fraud and abuse waivers will apply to enable benefit enhancements and other practice flexibility.\n\n e a-apm status will be available for this model \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e3\u00b6 ma plus plans will complete the all payer combination option application and ma plus revenue and patient count will be considered as part of the \u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a3medicare only\u00ee\u0093\u00e3\u0087\u00e2\u00a5 threshold needed to maintain a-apm status under macra.\n\n for affiliated acos, this model proposes protections to address concerns that could stem from a reduction in beneficiary count as a result of attribution-based enrollment in the ma plus plan. these protections include waivers of minimum beneficiary count requirements; recalculations of the minimum savings rate; rebasing the benchmark; partial forgiveness of advance payment model obligations; recalculation of population based payment; ability to switch to lesser mssp program tracks; and ability to withdraw from the aco program.\n\n hypotheses under the auspices of the cms innovation center, the model proposes to test the following hypotheses:\n\n e heightened levels of beneficiary satisfaction are associated with the ma plus model;\n e =6attribution-based enrollment into the ma plus model is an accepted process for beneficiaries to transition from fee-for-service medicare;\n e the ma plus model is a preferred avenue for providers to enter into risk-based contracts, and transition to value-based payment; and\n e alternative mechanisms to achieve network adequacy for the ma plus model promote enhanced healthcare access and increase the adoption of ma plans in rural areas.\n\n timeline\n cms is requested to consider this proposal for a 5-year pilot period under the cms innovation center. as proposed, the pilot period will start january 1, 2020 and will conclude on december 31, 2024. applications for participation will be accepted on an annual basis.\n\n unitypoint health october 16, 2018 - page 2\n\n\n attachment 1: ma plus model

honorable seema verma administrator centers for medicare & medicaid services 7500 security boulevard baltimore, md 21244 re: medicare program; medicare shared savings program; accountable care organizations-- pathways to success dear administrator verma: the undersigned national organizations dedicated to advancing effective mental health and substance use care in our nation thank the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) for the opportunity to comment, and would like to take this opportunity to offer several recommendations to support the accountable care organizations (acos) participating in the medicare shared savings program (mssp) in addressing mental health, addiction, and suicide in the individuals they serve. acos can play a critical role in addressing the growing overdose and suicide epidemics in the united states, but they need additional cms support. acos are currently incentivized to report on depression remission at twelve months (the only patient-reported outcome performance measure (pro-pm) across mental health, addiction, and suicide). according to the most recent public use file, among acos reporting this measure and excluding acos that reported a score of zero, the median rate of depression remission at twelve months in acos was approximately\n9%. a recent meta-analysis estimated that the rate of spontaneous remission at twelve months in \n an untreated population is approximately 53%.1 we do not have data on pro-pms related to substance use or outcomes related to suicide. acos need additional support from cms in addressing mental health, addiction, and suicide. the undersigned offer recommendations in three areas:\n1. promote behavioral health capacity in all acos \n cms should work with acos to ensure that each has the capacity to meaningfully address mental health and substance use in their population. the u.s. preventive services task force noted in 2016: in  2009,  the  uspstf  recommended  screening  all  adults  when  staff-assisted  depression  care supports  are  in  place  and  selective  screening  based  on  professional  judgment  and  patient preferences when such support is not available. in recognition that such support is now much more widely available and accepted as part of mental health care, the current recommendation statement\n 1 whiteford ha, harris mg, mckeon g, baxter a, pennell c, barendregt jj, wang j. estimating remission from untreated major depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis. psychological medicine. 2013 aug;43(8):1569-\n85. \n\n\n has omitted the recommendation regarding selective screening, as it no longer represents current clinical practice.2 while rates of depression screening have improved over the past several years, the poor performance on depression remission at twelve months indicates that there may be widespread gaps in post-screening follow-up. the same is likely true of addiction and suicide services. cms should support acos, using cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technical assistance, quality improvement, and learning collaborative infrastructures, as well as financial incentives, to implement effective mental health and substance use interventions that work in their practice context, such as the collaborative care model or other forms of evidence-based behavioral health integration using the newly created billing codes,3 certified peer support specialists and/or other forms of recovery support services, tele-behavioral health, and/or digital health interventions.\n2. explore ways to enhance data collection for patient-reported outcomes (pros) \n in mental health and substance use the majority of performance challenges in the depression remission at twelve months measure may be attributable to loss to follow-up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the aco was not able to screen a second time to determine if remission was achieved. data collection for mental health and substance use pros could be maximized and made more efficient by allowing individuals to screen at home. mental health and substance use screening could also be built into the beneficiary engagement incentives, so that repeated screening with an online portal integrated into the certified electronic health record technology is part of the incentivized healthy behaviors. this approach is especially salient as the evidence grows for measurement-based care and the value to patient outcomes for repeated mental health and substance use screening.4 cms should explore whether supporting acos in implementing home-based collection of mental health and substance use pros to determine if doing so allows acos to better follow-up and address the behavioral health needs of their population.\n3. offer additional outcomes-based payments in behavioral health \n additional investment in mental health and substance use services, supports, and infrastructure may help build new capacities and catalyze further innovation in acos. to ensure cost- neutrality for cms, cms can tie new payments to predicted future savings. for example, increased rates of depression remission likely predict savings to cms in reduced total health care spending over the next several years. cms could develop a methodology to share some of these predicted future savings with acos as they achieve specified behavioral health outcomes, assuming appropriate protections can be built in to avoid cherry-picking issues. note that the methods could be similar to those being used in the outcomes-based credits in the recently\n\n\n cms-approved maryland total cost of care model.5 with a methodology for sharing expected cms savings with acos, cms could justify outcomes-based investments in mental health and substance use care. conclusion the undersigned thank cms for the opportunity to comment and look forward to continuing to work with the administration on addressing our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s addiction and suicide epidemic. please do not hesitate to contact nathaniel z. counts, j.d., senior policy director of mha, at ncounts@mentalhealthamerica.net for follow-up or questions.\n sincerely, mental health america american foundation for

presented will stunt the growth of the aco program. presumably, cms seeks to encourage the growth of smaller or more rural acos since these are shown to produce more savings compared to larger acos (many of which are attached to a hospital). generally speaking, it takes 3-5 years to implement and tweak any new program and make it successful, especially if you are a new group. the truncated two-year glide path before risk must be incurred will lead to a lot of acos abandoning the program before they are able to fully implement a working program, especially considering the delays in data received from medicare (both the cclf data and the quarterly and benchmark data). in fact, with the extended reconciliation process, any aco will have to make the decision about whether to continue with the program shortly after they receive the first year's payment in october of their second year (if they are owed payment after the first year at all). i feel that the shortened timeframe, especially combined with the very low shared savings rate of max 25% will prove unattractive to many new acos. added to this, the burden of having a repayment plan in place before year 3 (again, shortly after they receive their first payment of max 25% if they are eligible for the payment in the first year) will shut out many smaller, more rural acos. smaller, more rural acos tend to have less resources than larger, hospital-based acos and may not be able to have the cash flow to both 1) support aco activities to produce savings and 2) have a lot of money tied up in escrow/surety bond to ensure repayment. if you seek to encourage smaller acos to apply, stay in the program, and flourish, you need to have a longer glide program available, perhaps the first 5-year contract can be risk-free before moving onto risk in a subsequent contract. this will also allow smaller acos enough time to shore up the cash for the repayment mechanism, should they need it in subsequent years.", "0465": "create a distinct set of participation levels for mssp acos that serve as safety-net and are community based and operated. our non-profit aco makes up a minority of mssp acos, that serve almost exclusively low income and underserved populations in numerous hpsas. our aco, consists of a disproportionate share dual eligibles (16%) and disabled (33%), including over 220 esrd attributables. 39% of the beneficiaries in our aco are under the age of 65. we have over 400 primary care practitioners working out of 169 primary care centers; all but 7 are fqhcs. it should also be noted that many of the employed primary care practitioners are subsidized by national health services corp. even though our aco is not hospital-owned, we connect with 30+ hospitals in georgia.\r\n\r\nour participant roster changed dramatically as of january 1, 2018, removing a large, municipal hospital partner that would not execute on our aco value-based care strategies (strategies that none the less generated reduction of unnecessary medical costs by 5.6% on average for each year [2013-2016] performing below a benchmark less than 9000). the expansion took our aco from largely urban to predominantly rural, comprising the largest fqhc networks statewide. py 2017 was first year that the aco ran a deficit. for all surplus performance years, our aco generated approximately $11.6m in savings, with only $1.6m of the infrastructure investment recouped. it is assessed that the py2017 deficit was attributed in part, to the former large hospital systems failure to execute as described above and soft steered medicare beneficiaries into high cost, admission-generating, specialty care. further, the chronic disease prevalence trend within our cohort is 2-3 times higher than the national average, with higher than average emergency department utilization due to social determinants of health (sdh) barriers. safety-net acos are not special but are different. the question has been raised on numerous occasions by our aco board as to whether or not cms accounts for the all commensurate factors in the benchmarking methods relative to fqhcs? all things considered with regard to risk adjustment methods, it seems that without clarification of the benchmarking allocations as applied to fqhcs in particular, that risk assumed under any of the proposed level, would insufficiently funded in accordance with those outlined in the proposed ruling.\r\n\r\nregarding infrastructure costs, participant organizations (2 of 13 are non-profit) have invested over $5m since 2013. cmmi should reinstate the aco investment model (aim) to subsidize and shared the investment in ongoing development, innovation and management operations. for example, our aco analyzed early on that many of our the chronically-ill attributed beneficiaries were being managed, seemingly with disconcerting intention by hospital-based ers, that set the goal to divert medicare beneficiaries from the fqhcs for primary care. consequently, the forged collaboration resulted in a strong ed diversion program, all at the direct expense borne by the fqhcs and the non-profits. add to the proposed rule that the aim program be instituted, comprised largely of fqhc and community-based health centers (non-profit, non-hospital owned/operated). our aco has made significant strides in appropriating their hcc coding for more accurate risk assessment and adjustment. prior the acos formation, and despite the fact that most of the health centers locations participated in some level of vbr with medicare advantage plans, some organizations were not focused documentation accuracy until the training was made available by the aco. in this regard, our aco has reached exceptional milestones, and is beginning to see the return on the intended value of participating in the mssp: to have a sustainable and reliable infrastructure capable of performing consistently well under risk and maintaining triple aim objectives, but also not put government subsidized and other dollars at undue risk. the mssp should account for the extraneous and intensive cost to deliver not only clinical needs with high tech, high touch service, but social determinant needs, that are in excess and fall well outside of the calculated benchmark expenditures and go almost fully un/under accounted. our methods are well defined in our initial mssp application. earned shared savings were used to enhance such infrastructure but remain insufficient. the current benchmarking factors dont fully address sdh barriers which contribute to deficits as a result. it also seems that behavioral health (substance abuse and mental health) and social determinant of health are underfunded for disparate populations. we propose cms have a separate allocation of funding to address sdh and psychosocial needs (including to fulfill service shortage gaps). alter the regional benchmark to allocate more of the regional spend for fqhcs which could project and address the costs associated with sdh.     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     additional comments to proposed rules\nmedicare shared savings program\nthe morehouse choice aco-es also endorses the following comments:\nrestructure the mssp with the proposed basic and enhanced tracks, with a separate track for fqhc predominant acos,  which includes a more gradual ramp up of risk in the basic track than currently available and permanent inclusion of basic level e (currently track 1+).\nfinalize the proposal to enact extended, five-year agreement periods.\nnot cut in half the shared savings rates for shared savings only acos and to apply the following shared savings rates: 50 percent for basic levels a and b, 55 percent for basic levels c and d, and 60 percent for basic level e.\nwe oppose requirements that high revenue acos \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or any acos \u00e2\u0080\u0094 be forced into higher levels of risk beyond basic level e.\nnot require any acos to participate in the enhanced track but keep that a voluntary model for acos prepared for higher levels of risk and reward.\nupdate the risk adjustment methodology by allowing risk scores to change by +/-5 percent over an agreement, as opposed to the proposed +/-3 percent range, and to eliminate the distinction between newly and continuously assigned beneficiaries.\nfinalize policies that support the move to regional benchmarking, including increasing the current maximum of 75 percent regional expenditures, and remove aco beneficiaries from the regional population and account for fqhc costs of social determinant of health intervention that may not be attested in historical claims payment but that could be attested through cost reporting.\nnot finalize the proposal to permit cms to terminate an aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation agreement if the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expenditures for the assigned beneficiary population exceed a certain amount after two performance periods.\nnot finalize the proposal to establish a june 30 deadline to voluntarily terminate aco participation agreements and not hold acos accountable for all shared losses if terminating after this date.\ncreate a policy that allows acos with agreements expiring in 2018 the option of extending their current participation agreements from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019.\nnot move forward with the proposed beneficiary opt-in assignment methodology and instead improve upon and enhance the current voluntary alignment process.  allow beneficiaries who receive services from fqhcs to have a full selection of providers from the aco provider supplier list by location, and expanding from the current pecos entries, because attributables should be able to select their practitioner at an fqhc location/site level versus the individual provider level.\nfinalize proposals to expand eligibility for the skilled nursing facility (snf) three-day rule and telehealth waivers, while considering additional waivers for acos to further engage patients.  allow waivers that provide for use of mobile applications that incentivizes (i.e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoints for rewards\u00e2\u0080\u009d) beneficiaries to further engage in self-management behaviors.\nfinalize proposals to introduce a beneficiary incentive program for mssp acos.\nfinalize the proposal to remove aco quality measure 11 and instead rely on attestation to evaluate the aco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of certified electronic health record technology (cehrt), while also excluding acos subject to the merit-based incentive payment system (mips) from promoting interoperability requirements\nalter rule to allow for qualifying fqhcs to earn merit-based incentive system payment adjustments\n\n\n",

of the washington state hospital association\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 107 member hospitals, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the centers for medicare & medicaid services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (cms) fiscal year (fy) 2019 proposed rule for the medicare shared savings program.  specifically, we would like to direct this comment on behalf of the 45 rural hospitals within the state of washington.\nwsha agrees that the transition to value-based care is key to realizing the triple aim within our health care system.  however, we are concerned that the proposed rule will make this transition much more difficult.  we understand cms\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in encouraging providers to move quickly towards risk assumption, but believe a period of upside-only risk is necessary to allow providers to move along the learning curve and achieve savings.\nwashington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rural providers are by-in-large small, independent hospitals with relatively low numbers of medicare enrollees.  their ability to find success within the aco model, let alone assume financial risk, is often hampered by a lack of ability to invest in the time, data systems and care redesign that must occur to be successful. many of our critical access hospitals lack the resources to make significant up-front investment in this area.  similarly, their fragile financial position makes the assumption of down-side risk prohibitive to participation.\nthe proposed rule creates unnecessary barrier for small and rural hospital participation.  while many have taken significant steps forward, others are just beginning to understand the change required to be successful in a value-based model.  a more gradual pathway is required for small and critical access hospitals.  we urge you to preserve an appropriate pathway to aco participation for rural hospitals, such as the one that currently exists in the aco investment model.\nwe thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule. please contact me if you have questions.\nsincerely,\njacqueline barton true\ndirector, rural health programs\nwashington state hospital association\n206.216.2541
