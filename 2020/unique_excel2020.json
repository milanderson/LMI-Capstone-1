you for the opportunity to provide public comments on the proposed rule regarding the medicare shared savings program quality reporting for 2021.  while i applaud the efforts to optimize quality reporting and move in the direction of low-burden, high-value measurement, the 2021 elimination of the web interface reporting mechanism will cause undue burden for medicare shared savings program aco participants. it is not unusual for acos to be comprised of participants on disparate electronic health records. the web interface tool allows for seamless pairing clinical data from various sites. elimination of this reporting mechanism in the short-term will create a reporting challenge for acos, and providers that comprise them, at an already dynamic time for healthcare organizations. if the goal remains to eliminate the web- interface mechanism, a prolonged phase-out will allow organizations to prepare.", "3": "...in addition, the move to a 4th decile aco quality performance threshold could prove detrimental for organizations struggling in the readmission and unplanned admission for multiple chronic condition metrics. these vital measures of utilization practices are complex and require intensive shifts in practice patterns to gain measurable improvement. given the aforementioned strains on the current healthcare system, the timing is poor to institute more stringent provider performance thresholds for acos.", "4": "we respectfully decline from supporting cms proposals to make sweeping changes to how quality is assessed for the shared savings program and for the merit based incentive program (mips). aco\u2019s are currently experiencing extreme stress due to the covid-19 pandemic and we are very concerned about our ability to cope with so many drastic changes. we urge cms to postpone making changes to the structure of the mssp quality measurement program.  acos\u2019 have invested considerable resources into maintain high quality which is the cornerstone of value based care. the purpose and aim of quality measurement must be to improve patient care and not to fit a universal mold. acos\u2019 should never be assessed the same as other apms and mips programs. cms should further refine quality measures to enhance patient care. cms created apms with specific goals in mind and we strongly feel that quality measures must be individually tailored for the needs of each apm.  the proposed approach lumps all apms and mips providers into one basket. historically acos have paralleled medicare advantage plans and aco quality standards are very similar to the medicare advantage program. we are also opposed to aco participants from selecting to report outside the aco since allowing the same could distort the performance of the risk bearing aco. we urge cms to continue the apm scoring standard at least until a proper aco centric replacement methodology can be agreed upon by all concerned stakeholders", "5": "pbaco is in favor of reducing administrative burden however we have significant concerns that the proposals, including limiting the number of performance based measures, puts acos at risk due to the dependence on the stability of fewer measures. over our seven years of program participation we have observed the mssp make errors and subsequent corrections to aco-11 in py2016 and py2017. furthermore, we have noticed remarkable nuances in the adjustment  3 methodology in our aco cahps measures. we support broad measurement across many measures where acos are insulated by the affects of errors, adjustments or other anomalies that can potentially erase an aco quality performance score and ultimately their shared savings multiplier and opportunity for annual revenue. we support that a larger set of quality measures smooths such anomalies, reduces overall aco risk and is worth any additional administrative burden.", "6": "cahps survey: we do not support combining the survey into one measure due our experience that certain measures can have anomalies including mssp errors, unpredictable adjustments and or other unexpected outcomes.  simply put, any benefit from reduced administration is far offset by the increased risk of the dependence on the accuracy and statistical stability of a single measure set. additionally, aco cahps cannot be compared to mips cahps. pbaco will have approximately 90,000 patients during 2021 and require a sample system that truly reflect large acos. the present system of 860 patients is too small a percentage of patients to predict the patient satisfaction scores with a 95% confidence level. we propose increasing the pbaco sample size to 2,000 patients as opposed to the mips-cahps requirement of 60,000 patients which is impractical to administer and very expensive.", "7": "present gpro measures: we strongly disagree with canceling the cms web interface. it has been our experience that ecqm adoption at practices is less than 25%. pbaco has over 30 emr systems with various capabilities as well as a dedicated team of three aco employees to facility education, optimization and implementation of our provider ehr systems. some emrs are not ready to collect ecqms intuitively and providers must go through convoluted workflows to report ecqms. secondly providers will have to report data from other payers, in addition to medicare as many ehrs do not have the capability to report by payer. this distorts the aco\u2019s medicare specific quality performance reporting. it is our opinion that the various ehr certification should refine and standardize workflows for ecqms which have been tested in the field and which do not increase administrative burden for providers. it is our observation that the respective ehrs have various workflows for the same ecqms and have not been pervasively implemented. the gap to achieve effective and efficient implementation of ecqms is still large and too large to justify the replacement of cms web interface quality submissions.  we do not agree that the proposed three quality measures are adequate to measure provider performance and to provide adequate insolation from the statistical risks of dependency on such few measures. we do agree that the domain score of 50% should not change with the proposed rule however we strongly recommend reinstating more and essential aco measures. please refer to table 36p. we have added back a) colorectal cancer screening, b) breast cancer screening, depression screening and follow-up, influenza immunization, and pneumococcal vaccinations. these measures are the core measures in an acos quality performance. pbaco has observed favorable outcomes from the training and implementation of depression screening and follow-up. we would like to reintroduce pneumococcal vaccinations as an important measure to reduce hospitalizations due to various forms of pneumonia. additionally, during covid-19 patients will have higher immunity levels to pneumonia caused bronchial infections. along with the reintroduction of these measures we request that the domain score for measures related to the wi remain stay constant at 50%.", "8": "claims based measures: we disagree with the proposed increased weight of the claims-based measures to 33% of the total score from 25%. we propose the reinstatement of ambulatory sensitive condition and maintain the total domain weight for claims based measures at 25%. essentially, we are proposing no change to these measures. we further caution cms that the reduction of claims based measures and the increase in domain weight can have unintended consequences and the introduction of risks to acos. please consider the mssp errors and subsequent corrections to aco-11 in py2016 and py2017. we believe that these errors set a precedent that errors can happen and that broadly reduces an acos ability to smooth or defend itself from such errors. considering that any given measure will have significantly more individual significance, errors, like those that occurred in py2016 or py2017 have a much higher chance of completely erasing an aco quality performance score and ultimately their shared savings multiplier and their opportunity for annual revenue.", "9": "removing the cms web interface reporting mechanism  it took several years of education and technological investment for pbaco to effectively and efficiently report quality using the cms web interface. eliminating this option will drastically increase pbacos cost for quality reporting due to the various emr vendors\u2019 ecqm annual registry fees.  we also have significant concerns regarding the lack of uniformity and ability to be compared to peers with the way ecqms are collected today. today\u2019s emrs report ecqms for all beneficiaries including aco and non-aco beneficiaries and medicare and non-medicare beneficiaries. we believe that this is a significant programmatic downside where current performance is medicare, incentive and demographic specific. in additional to the introduction of potentially irrelevant performance measurement, the variety and inconsistency of demographics by provider may potentially distort the performance measurement and the ability to accurately compare providers. it is possible that our payer specific data use agreements do not cover all demographics and we may run into legal conflicts with insurance companies. pbaco is in favor of less administrative burden but requests that cms continues to pursue other options including more widespread adoption of the cms web interface. it is our proposal that cms continues to run ecqms in parallel with the cms web interface and monitors the results. currently, pbaco is reporting quality for 2,792 patients. under the proposed rule we will be forced to report quality on 60,000 aco patients across dozens of disparate systems at a significant financial expense.  aco quality must be targeted to acos and their aco peers and cannot be compared to providers with disparate value based contract implementation, payor mix or demographic mix.", "10": "pbaco opposes the removal of pay-for-reporting when new measures are introduced. acos need time to educate on, build and implement workflows for new quality measures. we urge cms to not finalize this approach and instead maintain the pay-for-reporting for the first year introduced to acos in their initial performance year, as well as new quality measures when they are introduced or significantly changed. pbaco urges cms to utilize a scoring approach that is more like the current domain-based scoring approach instead of using an all-or-nothing approach as proposed. we do not see the correlation of value delivered by aco providers and the way that they are scored with an all-ornothing approach. we find it difficult to state that a 20th percentile performer receives 0 points or delivers 0 value while a 30th percentile performer receives 1.2 points or 55% of the value. we believe that further promoting this all-or-nothing approach will unjustly disconnect the correlation from the value that medicare beneficiaries and the medicare trust fund receive from status performance of acos and discourage providers from participation. one side effect of increased aco participation is improved performance in aco quality measures and the increase of the performance thresholds for percentile scoring. the all-or-nothing proposal of the 40th percentile required threshold allows that \u201cgood\u201d performance of previous years may be classified as 0 performance in future years. we expect that this is an enormous risk to the sustainability and the perceived fairness of the program by providers. we urge cms to move away from allor-nothing scoring replace with

addition, cms seeks comment on a potential alternative extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy for py 2022 and subsequent years. specifically, cms proposes to adjust the amount of shared

whom they receive their primary care services. therefore, we support excluding advance care planning services from mssp assignment when billed in an inpatient setting and excluding professional services furnished by fqhcs or rhcs when delivered in a snf. pbaco supports naacos recommendations that cms use a two-year assignment window for mssp to account for potential variations in attribution

shared savings program work to innovate and improve healthcare processes, but either cannot afford to personally take on risk, or because the margins are small in the aco financials, even a small amount of risk to too much for them to bear. we have physicians raising grave concerns about being required to take on risk. as you are aware, physician lead acos historically outperform hospital lead acos. upside only acos generate shared savings. we are aware medicare wants to push all aco to high risk, because the current high risk acos tends to generate greater degree of savings. at this point, high risk acos are self-selected. if all acos were forced into high risk, medicare cannot ensure the same degree of savings will occur. a steady amount of shavings generated by upside only acos brings value to the medicare system, continues to drive improvements and is potentially more sustainable long term. does medicare want short term gains or long term gains? personally, we think it is better

domain based approach. these changes are substantial. why does medicare want to make it more difficult for acos to attain shared savings? from my personal perspective, this is counter intuitive. shared savings is the carrot to make change happen. the threshold for receiving a percentage of savings should be reasonably obtainable. physician lead acos utilize a significant amount of the shared savings to drive innovation, care coordination and to support the practices to drive improvement. making the threshold too high will make the program no longer financially feasible for the physicians to participate. if physician lead acos consolidates with large entities to manage the acos, then medicare will suffer from the natural outcome of large consolidation, which is standardization. standardization reduces the amount of innovation that occurs and we will have another version of the medicare advantage system. a different thought on encouraging change is to have a step process for quality measures and percentage of savings which can be done for upside only acos. example: acos can choose to go with the current 23 measures for up to 50% of the shares savings of which they will receive savings based on their overall quality score. the alternative is to move to the proposed 6 measures report through the web interface and have the opportunity for 70% of shared savings, because

not 40%. some measures are very challenging and the aco has limited control of all of the various healthcare delivery components to the measure, such as all cause readmissions and unplanned admissions. for example, it has taken us several years to have the local hospitals provide the aco access to the discharge lists for our patients. since it can take time to build and educate on why working with the aco is of value, we request medicare to maintain the current minimum of 30%.   a second example to take into consideration, our aco suffered a substantial decline in mammography rates, because a regional mobile mammography provider went out of business. this was a major provider of mammography services for our aco patients and is no longer available for our region. they were the only provider. now we have substantial issues with transportation to obtain mammography screening. issues like this are unpredictable and if flexibility is removed from the system, the aco could suffer significantly. a third example is when acos take on new physician practices. even when new practices have experience in working with quality measures and risk, the aco environment is different than the medicare advantage experience and does not translate to success. the aco environment has a different process and cadence that must be taught. if an aco takes on too many new practices, this can create a significant challenge in improving quality measures year over year. acos need time to adapt and find new solutions for unpredictable events and taking on new physician practices. thus,

focus. the other component, we need to know the benchmarks for the 6 proposed measures. will cms take into consideration patient compliance? some patients take longer to archive care goals, while some patients never will. how will cms accommodate for these patients for whom the physician is doing their best to assist the patient, yet the patient is unable or unwilling to archive measure goals? in addition, is cms taking into account the aco patient mix with the 6 identified quality measures? do the acos have the same relative volume of diabetes and hypertension? if not, how will this be

reporting quality data, tracking measure performance, and how acos are evaluated and scored for both the medicare shared savings program (mssp) and merit-based incentive payment system (mips). there are multiple concerns with the proposed aco quality changes. first, replacing the current domain-based quality scoring approach with an all or nothing standard is a significant change that will have a big impact on aco performance. secondly, drastically reducing the number of quality measures from 23 to six de-emphasizes quality and will create a performance standard that may not be truly representative of an aco's actual quality improvement efforts. thirdly, abruptly removing the web interface as a reporting mechanism will have a big impact on acos' ability to get credit for their true quality efforts. cms should continue to offer the web interface as an option and over time allow additional reporting options to those acos who would be ready to implement, such as registry or electronic health record (ehr) reporting. additionally, moving to the alternative reporting options cms has provided through the proposed apm performance pathway (app) would cause many acos to have to

non-medicare and non-aco patient data, which is required when reporting using a registry or ehr. this could cause acos to have to revisit contracts and could raise legal concerns as the aco does not

consider the added challenges in retaining aco attribution due to the drop in primary care visit volume and consider the challenges of recruiting additional aco participants for the 2021 performance year as community providers are focused on managing through the healthcare crisis. these two factors will contribute to a reduction in final attribution for the 2020 performance year and reduced potential attribution and participation in the 2021 performance year. acos are committed to providing high quality care to our patients and quality improvement is at the core of what we do. making these sweeping changes at this challenging time will disadvantage our aco and we urge cms to consider this feedback in drafting the final rule. sincerely, mallory cary, aco director texas panhandle

to advancing the program\u2019s goals. we urge cms to obtain further stakeholder input before finalizing these changes. cms\u2019s proposed policy would require mssp aco participants to report on the same six measures that are proposed for the new mips app. we acknowledge that versions of these six measures already are used in the mssp program. however, as we note below, cms has proposed a significant change to how the data would be reported by eliminating the web interface reporting option, which would significantly affect how aco performance is benchmarked in the coming years. as a result, mssp participants do not know how they would fare using this specific configuration of measures, which is especially alarming given that cms also proposes to eliminate any pay-for-reporting years (also discussed below).  additionally, the proposed changes to the measure set come on the heels of significant changes to the structure of the mssp program as cms implemented its new pathways approach. the implementation of drastic changes to measurement as acos continue to adapt to the new program structure is enormously disruptive to acos, especially as they, too, grapple with the significant impacts of the covid-19 phe. instead of finalizing the changes now, we encourage cms to work with stakeholders to review the entirety of the current aco measure set, and use their input to help identify which measures are the best candidates for elimination. the agency could consider using input from the measure applications partnership (map) as a part of its upcoming cycle to obtain multi-stakeholder input on these changes. again, the aha strongly supports the concept of streamlining measure sets; however, we fear the potential for significant unintended consequences if the mssp measure sets are adopted too precipitously.", "48": "removal of web interface reporting. the aha does not support the removal of the web interface reporting option for acos at this time. the web interface has been used by acos since the mssp\u2019s inception to report data on non-claims based measures used in the program. the web interface collects data on medicare beneficiaries participating in the mssp, and has a set of data collection and attribution approaches associated with it. however, cms proposes to eliminate it because its use outside of the mssp program is limited, and the agency is seeking to bring the mssp quality measurement approach into closer alignment with the mips. while we appreciate the potential benefits of greater alignment between programs, there are profound differences between how data are submitted in the \u201cregular\u201d mips program and how they are reported by acos using the web interface. in the first place, the data collection types that would now be available to acos \u2013 ehrs, qualified registries and qualified clinical data registries \u2013 all require data to be collected on an allpayer basis, and not simply on medicare beneficiaries. for a program that is called the medicare shared savings program, and is intended to improve the care for medicare beneficiaries, we question the appropriateness of including all-payer data. furthermore, allowing the use of multiple different reporting options in the mssp could have significant impacts on measure benchmarks. there are differences in the measure specifications among each of these reporting mechanisms; it is possible, even when reporting on the same measure title, to receive different scores. for that reason, when cms calculates performance benchmarks in the mips program, it creates separate benchmarks for each data collection type. yet, cms does not address in this rule how it intends to reconcile any potential performance differences among acos that may stem from differences in data collection types. unless and until cms can address the two issues above, it is not appropriate to remove the web interface reporting option. at a minimum, we urge the agency to delay removal of the reporting mechanism until cy 2022 at the very earliest.", "49": "increase to quality performance standard. the aha does not support cms\u2019s proposal to increase the quality

it takes significant resources to learn measure specifications, assess baseline performance and implement workflow changes \u2013 it and otherwise \u2013 necessary for accurately capturing and improving quality performance. furthermore, when cms makes significant changes to existing measure specifications, providers must make several of these same adaptations. given that cms now scores mssp

capabilities in a sustainable fashion before their shared savings or losses are tied to quality performance.", "52": "transition to the app and removal of web interface reporting option gnyha opposes the transition of mssp quality reporting to the app. while this proposal would reduce the burden on acos in terms of the overall number of measures required for submission, it would impose new burdens because cms would discontinue the web interface reporting option. instead, acos would be required to report quality information through one of the allowable methods under the apm app, either through a registry or direct submission via electronic health records (ehrs). acos have invested significantly in developing processes to allow for the submission of quality data. switching to either of the app reporting options would require significant investments in workflow changes, new infrastructure such as registries, and/or adaptation of ehrs to comply with electronic clinical quality measure standards. not only would this impose significant financial and operational burdens on acos, the required operational changes could not be completed by the start of the 2021 performance year. as with all health care providers, acos are currently struggling with numerous challenges and significant uncertainty due to the covid-19 pandemic. it would be irresponsible to implement such a drastic change at this time. furthermore, the quality submission options proposed by cms do not allow for quality reporting and measurement specific to only aco attributed beneficiaries. therefore, acos would be assessed for quality performance on non-aco assigned beneficiaries. gnyha believes that aco quality performance should be limited, to the extent possible, to the defined cohort of beneficiaries that are assigned to the aco. therefore, to avoid placing unnecessary burden on providers and to ensure that quality measurement reflects the true performance of each aco, gnyha recommends that cms withdraw its proposal to remove the web interface reporting option.", "53": "revision of the quality performance standard cms proposes to raise the quality performance standard (the minimum threshold for an aco to be eligible for shared savings) from the 30th percentile for at least one measure in each domain to requiring a mips  quality performance score at or above the 40th percentile across all mips categories. this change makes it more difficult for acos to earn shared savings. as mentioned above, the covid-19 pandemic has caused significant uncertainty among acos. while we applaud cms for its efforts to address the potential impact on the various pay-for-performance programs for 2020, we believe such a major change to the mssp quality performance standard is premature. the long-term impact of covid-19 on medicare beneficiaries and ultimately its impact on quality measurement is still unclear. for example, cms\u2019s proposed rule impact analysis is based on 2018 data and

too fast \u2013 especially in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. while the agency\u2019s proposal would reduce the amount of reporting required of an aco, it also would require acos to quickly pivot from established quality measurement and reporting processes, even as many of them are still in the midst of responding to the pandemic. specifically, cleveland clinic aco meets its reporting obligations via the web interface (as did over 98 percent of acos in 2019, as the agency itself noted), and this method of reporting is sufficiently integrated into our workflows as to be nearly automated. in contrast, elimination of the web interface would require us to quickly transition to reporting via a different mechanism. further, we would need time to understand the differences in measures specifications between the web interface and our chosen reporting mechanism, and identify and adjust to any potential impact on performance. cms itself notes the potential burden associated with making this transition. we ask that the agency postpone implementation of this proposal until at least the 2022 performance period, in order to provide sufficient time for acos identify and plan

cqmc aco/pcmh core measure set aiming to: identify high-value, high-impact, evidence-based measures; align measures across public and private payers; and reduce the burden of measurement by eliminating low-value metrics, redundancies and inconsistencies in measure specifications and quality measure reporting requirements across payers.  cqmc membership includes cms, health insurance providers, medical associations, consumer groups, purchasers (including employer group representatives) and other quality collaboratives working together to recommend core sets of measures by clinical area to assess the quality of american health care.  bcbsa is a voting member in the cqmc and recently voted in opposition to including the hospital-wide, 30-day, all-cause unplanned readmission (hwr) rate for mips eligible clinician groups measure in the aco/pcmh measure set. bcbsa instead voted in support of ncqa\u2019s plan all-cause readmission (pcr) measure. health plans use the pcr measure more widely as it is an ncqa accreditation requirement. additionally, discussion with the cqmc workgroup included identification that the pcr measure is more robust and broader than the hwr measure. for example, the pcr measure includes patients 18 and older while the hwr measure only includes patients 65 and older.  the risk standardized, all-cause unplanned admissions for multiple chronic conditions for acos measure was not reviewed by the cqmc aco/pcmh workgroup. cqmc members can bring measures forward for review, yet this measure was not identified for review with the  workgroup by

very challenging time, when our aco and the health care industry as a whole continue to navigate the great uncertainty resulting from the covid-19 global health pandemic. we urge cms to not finalize these proposals and continue to work with acos to adapt the quality measurement and assessment process. there are multiple concerns with the proposed aco quality changes. first, replacing the current domain-based quality scoring approach with an all or nothing standard is a significant change that will have a big impact on aco performance. secondly, drastically reducing the number of quality measures from 23 to six de-emphasizes quality and will create a performance standard that may not be truly representative of an aco's actual quality improvement efforts. thirdly, abruptly removing the web interface as a reporting mechanism will have a big impact on acos' ability to get credit for their true quality efforts. cms should continue to offer the web interface as an option and over time allow additional reporting options to those acos who would be ready to implement, such as registry or electronic health record (ehr) reporting. additionally, moving to the alternative reporting options cms has provided through the proposed apm performance pathway (app) would cause many acos to have to pay for registries and/or ehr upgrades and dashboards to capture the correct data to be able to report to cms. finally, there are remaining questions regarding how the aco would report the data for non-medicare and non-aco patient data, which is required when reporting using a registry

pay-for-reporting year as a time to get the correct processes and performance dashboards in place to be able to be successful in their quality improvement efforts. these are critical and removing them

savings program quality performance standard cms proposes to increase the level of quality performance that would be required for all acos to meet the medicare shared savings program (mssp) quality performance standard to the 40th percentile or above across all mips quality performance category scores. the previous standard was achieving the 30th percentile on one measure in each domain. additionally, the proposal includes a provision applicable to 2021 and subsequent performance years specifying that acos must submit quality data via the app to satisfactorily report on behalf of the eligible clinicians who bill under the tin of an aco participant for purposes of the mips quality performance category. cms proposes that to qualify for shared savings, an aco must meet the minimum savings rate requirements established for the track/level, meet the proposed quality performance standard described in the proposed rule, and otherwise maintain its eligibility to participate in the spp. for performance years beginning on or after january 1, 2021, if an aco that is otherwise eligible to share in savings meets the proposed quality performance standard, the aco will share in savings at the maximum sharing rate according to the applicable financial model (up to the performance payment limit). if the aco fails to meet the proposed quality performance standard, the aco would be ineligible to share in savings. recommendation: we do not support changing the quality measure minimum threshold from the 30th to 40th percentile. achieving shared savings is very difficult work. the 30th percentile is currently difficult to achieve for some measures due to small numbers and tight benchmarks. an aco could have a high quality score and score below the 40th percentile on just one measure, and the way cms has written the proposed change, having one measure below the 40th percentile could make the aco ineligible for shared savings. for the 2019 performances year, our aco had an overall quality score of 96%; we also scored a 40th percentile or lower on 2 of the 23 measures. if this proposed change was in place for the 2019 performance year, our aco would have been ineligible for shared savings, even with a significantly high score. the current corrective action plan is the appropriate next step when an aco does not score well in quality. we do not support a penalty of losing all shared savings opportunities for a year where quality performance does not meet the minimum attainment, as ngacos already take on a high amount of risk.", "61": "i. comment on quality and reporting requirements cms proposes to revise the medicare shared savings program (mssp) quality performance standard effective for performance year 2021 and subsequent performance years. according to cms, the new app would streamline reporting requirements for mssp acos and would create a complementary path to the mips value pathways. under this proposal, the number of measures acos would be scored on would decrease from 23 to 6, and the number of measures on which acos would be required to actively report would be reduced from 10 to 3. acos would only need to report one set of quality metrics that would satisfy the reporting requirements under both mips and the mssp. the four categories in the proposed app  our mission is to improve health and well-being in partnership with our members, patients and community. framework would be weighted as follows: quality: 50%; promoting interoperability: 30%; improvement activities: 20%; and cost: 0%. recommendation: our organization includes providers who participates in the mips program and the next generation aco model. the next generation aco model follows the same rules as the mssp acos. as a next generation aco, we appreciate that medicare is proposing to reduce the number of quality measures for acos. this would reduce the reporting burden and allow acos to focus on a select number of quality measures. a lower number of measures also means that there is more weight placed on only a few quality measures. we have reviewed the proposed quality measures and agree with continuing to report on the proposed preventive health and at risk population measures. however, we would request more information on the cahps measures such as will the current 2019/2020 cahps measures continue in 2021? healthpartnersthrough its park nicollet aco has participated in cmmi aco risk programs since 2012 and because of the subjective nature of the survey our overall patient experience domain score has varied significantly through the years. we believe part of this could be that the survey is lengthy, and not all of the questions apply to all of the patients, causing a low response rate to some of the questions that can skew the results. only 861 of our overall aco patients (~15,000) receive this survey and less than 400 of our patients usually complete the survey. the number of patients responding creates a challenge. it is difficult to implement changes to address all survey topics for all patients as well as rely on the patient to recall what was recently discussed. we are also concerned about the number of surveys that our patients receive as it is our organizations current practice to send all patients a short experience survey after each visit at healthpartners.  healthpartners agrees that patient experience is an important part of the triple aim to evaluate and would like to continue including these measures in quality reporting, however we are concerned that reducing the number of overall measures puts disproportionate weight on the cahps for aco survey results for all the reasons noted above; we are not fully confident that the results of the survey reflect our aco patients experience.  the proposed 2021 quality measures also include 2 claims measures from the care coordination/patient safety domain. our aco would also like to provide feedback on these 2 measures as 2 of the 6 proposed measures. we have found that we have also had a lot of variation for our results related to the risk standardized 30-day readmissions measure. healthpartners has found that the benchmarks for the claims based measures are very tight. our numerator and denominator are relatively small, which means that if a few additional patients are admitted or readmitted (depending on the measure) our results can easily swing from passing to failing. we would suggest evaluating how the benchmarks are set for the claims-based measures.....", "62": "iii. comment on

the web interface cms proposes to eliminate the web interface reporting option starting with the cy 2021 reporting period. this option was previously available to groups and virtual groups of 25

participants to report quality measure data via the web interface, and the vast majority of web interface users were in the mssp. we describe the mssp quality reporting changes elsewhere in this advisory. lastly, cms notes that the web interface requirements were significantly more stringent than the other mips reporting options, and that nine out of the 10 measures included in the web interface would remain available in the mips using one of the other mips reporting options. recommendation: retiring the web interface at this time would create an undue hardship and financial burden on practices, as currently still operating in covid-19 pandemic state. it also reduces flexibility in reporting as to what works well for one practice versus another. the consensus among industry analysts is that most electronic health records have not been able to keep up with the changing requirements of the mips program, and that qcdrs are not able to report all categories of the program. it would be detrimental that cms provides a list of all mvp measures/specifications to all electronic medical record vendors and qcdrs early on, so that all emrs and qcdrs have the ability to report in a timely manner. the administrative burden associated with moving to a new reporting mechanism involves allocating staffing resources to redesign care process and work flows, at the potential expense of the overall care experience for patients in order to meet the reporting requirements. also, it states on page 50279 of the rule, that the traditional mips option will continue to be available for 2021. therefore, we recommend that the web interface remain a reporting option in 2021 to allow practices time to convert to a new reporting mechanism, with the ability to test out the new reporting mechanism alongside the web interface. this would allow groups to continue submissions as have historically and would ease reporting burden during a national pandemic. some of the reporting options offered, such as ecqms and mips cqms, require all payer data be submitted. this is a significant change from reporting medicare ffs only through the web interface, as the denominator has been greatly increased, and creates unknown risk in how a practice may score under the new reporting method. therefore, we again recommend that groups be allowed to report two ways for 2021 \u2013

2021 and subsequent performance years. specifically, cms would require acos in the mssp to report quality data via the newly proposed app. under this new approach, acos would report a smaller set (six versus 23) of quality metrics that would satisfy the reporting requirements under both mips and the mssp. we urge cms to be thoughtful in its approach for adoption of the app, and other drastic changes to the mssp, at a time when acos are faced with ongoing concerns related to the covid-19 pandemic.  a. cms should further engage stakeholders before implementing the app for acos participating in the mssp, and the agency should seek feedback on the app measure set to ensure reliability and fairness and prevent unintended consequences. we understand cms\u2019 desire to align the mssp quality performance standard with the proposed app under the qpp, such that participants in the mssp also would report quality via the app. while we support greater alignment and reduced burden, introducing a new pathway such as the app requires careful consideration. cms notes the app was designed for all mips apms. however, the agency believes the app measure set also would be appropriate for acos participating in the mssp. the app contains a narrower measure set than previously used in mssp quality measurement\u2014six measures versus the current 23 scored measures. the six measures are related to patient experience, diabetes, depression screening, blood pressure control, all-cause unplanned readmissions, and all-cause unplanned admissions for multiple chronic conditions. we applaud cms\u2019 intent to move the quality measure set used in the mssp toward more outcome-based, primary care measures. however, we do not feel the current proposed app measure set achieves this goal. as quality reporting programs focus more on outcomes and move away from process measures, cms must ensure that measures chosen for these programs accurately reflect quality of care and account for factors beyond a hospital\u2019s control. the agency should ensure the measure set includes metrics that are valid and reliable; aligned with other existing measures; and risk adjusted for sociodemographic factors. cms should not include measures in aco quality performance standards until they have been appropriately risk adjusted for sociodemographic factors, including socioeconomic status. without appropriate risk adjustment for outcomes measures, such as the proposed readmission measure, the app measure set could disproportionately impact the performance of essential hospitals. we urge cms to take time to gather more stakeholder input, such as through a request for information and listening sessions. further, cms should seek endorsement by organizations with measurement expertise, such as the national quality forum (nqf) and its measure applications partnership (map). through nqf processes, measures are fully vetted and approved through a consensus-building approach

standard and be eligible for shared savings. we believe this requirement is achievable since the benchmarks are released early enough during the performance year, helping an aco set goals throughout the year. in addition, there are enough measures in each domain to allow acos to meet the 30th percentile in at least one measure per domain. we believe that the proposal to increase the minimum

performance from one year to the next in order to recognize the work the aco has undertaken to improve their quality score. app: amga supports the use of the app as a scoring pathway for merit-based

important to the longer-term stability of the mssp program and its success. due to the continued impact of the covid-19 outbreak, we also recommend that cms consider stakeholder input and propose further changes for py 2021 that may be warranted to reduce unnecessary burdens on providers to better enable them to focus on providing care to medicare enrollees and responding to continuing challenges. ahip supports cms\u2019 proposed flexibility for mssp py 2020 given the extenuating circumstances and further urge it to consider additional flexibility for py 2021 with stakeholder

proposed rule would replace the current mips apm scoring standard, which allows each apm to have its own set of unique quality measures and scoring approaches that best fit the particular model. the current approach allows specific apms to have meaningful quality measures tailored to their model\u2019s goals while still providing credit for quality improvement efforts to those who are also subject to mips. the proposed app approach would instead apply one set of quality measures for all apms subject to mips. therefore, each model participant would need to report not only their apm\u2019s specific quality measures, but the app quality measures as well. this one size fits all approach results in more burden for apm participants and further may require the model participants to report on measures that are not applicable or appropriate. moreover, given the proposed delay in the implementation of mvp, we are unclear why this proposal should be rushed to implementation. the mssp acos have used the web interface since the beginning of the program and will need time to create a new workflow. we instead urge cms to maintain the apm scoring standard. cms also proposes significant changes to the quality measure set acos must report under the new app. the total number of aco quality measures would be reduced from 23 to 6, and the number of measures for which acos are required to submit data would be reduced from 10 to 3. generally speaking we support a reduction in measures to reduce reporting burden. however, we are concerned the proposal goes too far and may not sufficiently capture aco performance. we urge cms to gather additional stakeholder input before finalizing a revised set. in particular, from the measure applications partnership (map) that is intended to advise on the appropriateness of measures in medicare, and the core quality measure collaborative (cqmc) on which cms partners with ahip that is intended to facilitate the alignment of measures across public and private payers. cms should seek additional stakeholder feedback before making such significant changes to the measure set and within the context of whether its finalizes the apm scoring standard policy.", "92": "cms proposes that acos would need to achieve at least a 40th percentile quality performance score across all categories to share in savings or avoid owing maximum losses. cms proposes that it could terminate participation agreements with acos that fail to meet the quality performance standard for two consecutive years or three non-consecutive years, out of a five-year contract. we are concerned about increasing the minimum quality performance score to the 40th percentile and cms establishing a policy to terminate participation agreements with acos that fail to meet the quality performance standard at this time. while we appreciate and support ensuring the acos meet a minimum level of quality and increasing that minimum over time, the current pandemic calls for a pause in any increases in expectations. as cms notes, 99.6 percent of acos participating in the page 12 of 12 program in 2018 met the 30th percentile showing that a small minority of acos struggle in this area and would benefit from technical assistance rather than being dropped from the program. these acos have committed to pursuing higher quality outcomes and have every incentive to do so. if they are dropped from the program, the providers and suppliers that comprise them will have less motivation to invest time and resources to achieve such outcomes. moreover, as measures become topped out or change unexpectedly due to the pandemic, failure to meet a threshold may reflect more about the scoring system itself or exigent forces than the actual quality of patient care. thus, we do not, at this time, support increasing the minimum quality threshold or removing acos from the mssp program for failing to achieve it.", "93": "for cy2021, cms proposes to reduce provider burden, align measures across programs, and address high priority areas for quality improvement by implementing apm performance pathway (app) for mips apms for mssp accountable care

to simplify the reporting requirements by reducing the number of reported measures from 23 measures to six, and the number of actively reportable measures from ten to three. the proposed implementation date for the app is january 1, 2021. centene supports efforts to streamline quality measurement and reporting. however, we caution against any massive program changes that may create more complications for acos. as cms continues to propose adjustments to the mssp program, we ask that there is a smooth transition period for any major methodology changes. in order to effectively encourage performance improvements and aco participation, cms should actively work to reduce operational burden.", "96": "while we appreciate cms' goal of aligning measures across programs and support eliminating unnecessary and inappropriate measures, ochsner is exceedingly concerned about and cannot endorse the extent to which cms has proposed to reduce the mssp quality measure set. further, these sweeping changes would be implemented during a covid-19 public health emergency and are tied to a final rule that will be released in december 2020, which will leave acos only one month to transition to the new reporting method. from a broad perspective, ochsner believes that acos should not be evaluated and assessed in the same manner as all other apms or individual mips clinicians who are not participating in total cost of care and full accountability payment models. it is also unclear how cms determined that the app measures are more appropriate the current apm quality measures. the proposed one size fits all approach does not take into consideration the spectrum and variability between mips apm programs where each apm has specific goals and objectives or create a set of measures that better inform patients. for example, it does not make clinical sense for the bundled payments for care improvement advanced, or bpci-a, to be compared and measured on the same set of measures that apply to the comprehensive primary care plus (cpc+) participants. quality measurement with apm programs should focus on measures most appropriate for the individual program and hold health care providers and organizations accountable for the quality and cost of care. ochsner recommends that cms postpone making any structural changes to how aco quality is assessed and reported until at least 2022 or 2023 and work with stakeholders to develop the best balanced, fair and technically sound quality measures. in the meantime, we urge cms to maintain the current apm scoring standard approach. while the proposed revision to aco quality measures may reduce administrative burden, they significantly alter and narrow the lens through which quality is assessed. the proposed six app measures are a drastic reduction from the 23 measures currently used to assess acos. we believe the proposal goes too far by reducing the number of clinical quality measures to only three measures focused on controlling diabetes and high blood pressure and screening for depression. we recommend that cms retain several important preventative care quality measures that are a strength of the current set of quality measures and have been proven to improve patient outcomes, including: aco-14, influenza immunization; aco-19, colorectal cancer screening; aco 20, breast cancer screening; and, the previously used pneumonia vaccination measure. we also have significant concerns that two of the six quality measures are focused on all-cause unplanned hospital admissions and readmissions. the unplanned readmissions measure has a very narrow band where there is less that a 1 percent difference between the 30th percentile and the 90th percentile for the 2020 benchmark targets for aco-8, risk standardized, all condition readmission. as a result, small differences in readmissions can result in drastic differences in quality scores that are not meaningful or an accurate reflection of an aco's quality improvement efforts. further, since the aco program already provides direct financial incentives to reduce avoidable hospital admissions and readmissions, we do not believe it is appropriate to have onethird of the total measure set linked to these utilization measures. in response, ochsner recommends that cms postpone any significant changes in aco quality measures until 2022 or 2023 and utilize the interim period to consult with the aco community and patient representatives to determine the most appropriate set of measures that will lead to meaningful improvements in the quality of care.", "97": "ochsner opposes this all-or nothing approach to shared savings, particularly surrounding the use of the proposed hospital readmissions measure with an extremely narrow bands in performance percentiles. instead, should cms move forward with its redesigned quality assessment structure for acos, we recommend that cms use a scoring method similar to the current domain-based scoring approach. for example, cms could instead consider a policy that would use a minimum attainment requiring 50 percent of the quality measures to meet or exceed the 40th percentile, which must also be done in concert with our recommendations to add additional clinical quality measures to the measure set currently proposed by cms. setting the standard at 50 percent ensures that acos perform well on a substantial set of measures to earn shared savings but does not punish acos that may fall below the performance threshold on a measure that is not as relevant to their patient population or has a very narrow range of performance percentiles, such as the proposed hospital readmissions measure.", "98": "the proposed medicare shared savings program (mssp) quality measures are the right

on only a few quality measures. we have reviewed the proposed quality measures and agree with the continuing to report on the proposed preventive health and at risk population measures. however, we would request more information on the cahps measures such as will the current 2019/2020 cahps measures continue in 2021? one mha member has participated in cmmi aco risk programs since 2012 and

measures. this member has found that there is a lot of variation for their results related to the risk standardized 30-day readmissions measure. benchmarks for the claims based measures are very tight. numerators and denominators are relatively small, which means that if a few additional patients are admitted or readmitted (depending on the measure), results can easily swing from passing to failing. we would suggest evaluating how the benchmarks are set for the claims-based measures. we would also like the readmissions benchmark to be evaluated considering the cms hospital readmission penalty program has determined to remove at least q1 and q2 2020 readmissions from their performance data. additionally, we would like more information on if adjustments will be made for the aco readmission data, both exclusions and benchmarking impact. the measure risk standardized all- cause admissions for patients with chronic conditions is also very challenging to address and track during the year. the same mha member aco as above reports that it has tried to create a proxy measure to track how we are performing on this measure, however they have not been able to do that for the following reasons. there are a total of 8 conditions in this measure and the patient has to have at least 2 of the 8 to be in the numerator. they have not been able to duplicate the same risk-adjustment methodology to compare their results to how they would be measured. their aco has multiple interventions in place to address the needs of patients with chronic conditions, however

not support making these significant changes during the phe, and especially due to the delayed release of the final rule. in addition to changing the gpro, cms proposed to change the mssp quality scoring methodology and remove the pay-for-reporting year. the impact of covid-19 is significant; acog recommends that cms lower the performance thresholds and delay the implementation of changes so

above, acog greatly appreciates cms\u2019 rapid and flexible response to phe, including the decision to adopt mips extreme and uncontrollable circumstances hardship exception policies in both 2019 and 2020. we strongly urge cms to continue to provide flexibility to physicians by extending these policies through 2021 in the final rule. physicians need flexibility and minimal administrative burdens to ensure they are able to continue to meet the needs of patients while confronting new covid outbreaks and slowing the spread of the virus. physician practices have been under severe distress and experienced unprecedented practice disruptions during 2020. while the duration of the pandemic is unknown, it is reasonable to expect ongoing impacts from the novel coronavirus into 2021 and months or years of recovery. acog recommendation for modifications to quality reporting requirements: finalize the extension of the mips extreme and uncontrollable circumstances hardship exception policies for 2021.", "121": "while the task force is directionally supportive of the proposed changes to the mssp\u2019s quality performance standard and reporting requirements, the proposal to implement these changes for performance year 2021 provides insufficient time for mssp acos to make adjustments. we urge cms to introduce a transition year and finalize any changes to the reporting mechanism no earlier than cy 2022 to allow providers adequate time to adapt, particularly given they continue to grapple with the impact of covid-19 pandemic on their operations. earlier, cms accepted public comment (from hcttf and others) requesting a delay in implementing the mips value pathways due to the readiness of clinicians in making this transition. the same leniency afforded mips-eligible clinicians should be afforded to acos. we appreciate that cms has proposed better alignment between the reporting requirements for mips and advanced apms, which creates a better glidepath for providers for providers looking to transition away from fee-for-service. the task force has long encouraged cms to establish a parsimonious set of quality measures and better alignment across apms and quality reporting programs. the smaller, more focused apm performance pathway (app) measure set is appropriate to count for both aco and mips reporting as apm entities are incentivized through the terms of the respective apm agreements to improve value. however, we are concerned that in reducing the set of measures, cms has removed all preventative health measures, instead shifting the focus entirely to management of illness and cost rather than prevention. of particular concern during the covid pandemic, the measures selected do not allow acos to report results during telehealth visits. cms should consider inclusion of quality measures that are foundational to preventive care and care coordination, as well quality measures for services performed via telehealth. additionally, not all providers in acos will meet the threshold for qualified advanced apms participants, and the alignment between mips and mssp reporting requirements creates an easier pathway to move away from fee-for-service and advance to shared risk models. however, we are concerned that the app approach is not appropriate for all apm participants (additional feedback below).", "122": "cms is proposing to revise the mssp quality performance standard beginning with the 2021 performance year by implementing a higher quality performance standard where acos would now be required to receive a quality performance score equivalent to or above the 40th percentile across all mips quality performance category scores in order to share in savings or avoid owing maximum losses. it is critical to the success of delivery system reform that quality of care continues to improve over time along with expectations of cost savings. however, hcttf does not support implementation of this policy in 2021 as providers still manage and recover from the pandemic and are without pre-established benchmarks to measure against. the task force also opposes the proposal to eliminate the pay-for-reporting year. acos use the pay-forreporting year to prepare and document measures appropriately. additionally, the pay-forreporting year is important in that it provides a benchmark year for subsequent measurement purposes.", "123": "the task force supports the proposed change to modify the euc to consider the higher of an aco's 2020 quality performance score or its 2019 quality performance score used for financial reconciliation. should the covid-19 public health emergency carry over into 2021, cms should also consider applying the same policy to the 2021 performance year \u2013 applying the higher of the aco\u2019s 2021 quality performance score or its 2020 quality performance score used for financial reconciliation. in cms-1744-ifc, cms proposed applying the higher of 1) the mean quality score across all acos or 2) the aco\u2019s own quality score if that aco could completely and accurately report all quality measures for 2020. responding to that proposal, we stated that - given the massive shifts in care delivery sites and staffing, increased telehealth utilization, data collection challenges and other covid-19 related impacts in 2020 - we did not believe that the application of either an average quality score or individual aco quality score based on data from the 2020 performance year would be feasible or appropriate. the task force appreciates cms\u2019s attention to this issue and believes the plan proposed here is a reasonable compromise on this issue.", "126": "cms is proposing to decrease the number of measures from 23 to 6, and the number of actively reportable measures from 10 to 3. the proposed app would replace the current shared savings program quality measure set to simplify reporting requirements. the new app framework would also be weighted different, with quality accounting for 50 percent, pi accounting for 30 percent, ia accounting for 20 percent, and cost accounting for 0 percent. acos would be scored on the measures they choose to report but would receive zero points for those they do not report. further, cms proposes to remove the phase in approach for quality reporting. regardless of performance year and agreement period, all acos would be scored on the same 3 actively reportable quality measures: 1) diabetes: hemoglobin a1c poor control (>9%); 2) preventive care and screening: screening for depression and follow-up plan; and 3) controlling high blood pressure. while we appreciate the more streamlined measures for quality reporting and decreasing the total number, 2 of the 3 measures (a1c and controlling high blood pressure) are not appropriate for this patient population. current measures in the mssp, as well as other medicare programs and models, are not clinically appropriate or applicable to a frail, seriously ill, and home-limited patient population (i.e., those treated by home care medicine practices). we are concerned that even though physicians are delivering high-touch, high-quality, and clinically appropriate care to this medically complex patient population, they are penalized under these programs due to the quality measures. additionally, this deters others from participating in the program. thus, we urge cms to adopt a more clinically appropriate measure set that is inclusive of complex, chronic care patients. we recommend 2 replacement measures from the home based primary and palliative care data registry: 1) telephone contact, virtual, or in-person visit within 48 hours of hospital discharge of home-based primary care and palliative care patients, and 2) medication reconciliation within 2 weeks of hospital discharge of home-based primary care and palliative care patients. additionally, we request that cms review the following publication that identifies large gaps in which home visits are not included in meaningful measures: to what extent are the centers for medicare & medicaid services 2019 mips quality measures inclusive of home-based medical care? we would be happy to meet and discuss further with the agency.", "128": "cms is proposing to include certain codes for technical changes to the definition of primary care starting january 1, 2021. cms is proposing to revise the following primary care services codes to account for online digital e/m, assessment of and care planning for patients with cognitive impairment, chronic care management, non-complex chronic care management, principal care management, and psychiatric collaborative care management. cms defines online digital evaluation, or e-visits, to be non-face-to-face, patient-initiated communications using online patient portals. the chronic disease management code requires two or more chronic conditions that place the patient at a significant risk of death or co-morbidities. other requirements are applied to the following new codes: non-complex chronic care management, principal care management, and psychiatric collaborative care management. we are supportive of this proposal to update the definition of primary care services. we support the inclusion of the hcpcs code g2010 (virtual communication) as well.", "130": "we would encourage cms to refrain from making further changes to the mssp extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy at this time. given the numerous changes to the mssp extreme and page 18 uncontrollable circumstances policy made over the last two years -- including those made during the phe to account for impacts arising out of covid-19 -- we encourage cms to avoid any additional significant policy changes as we collectively continue to assess the impacts of covid-19 and have more experience and data to share that might better inform additional changes to the established policy.", "133": "cms proposes to establish two policies that would allow certain acos to benefit from a lower repayment mechanism amount than would otherwise be required under the current regulations. the first policy would apply prospectively to any renewing aco that uses an existing repayment mechanism to establish its ability to repay any shared losses incurred for performance years in its new agreement page 19 period. the second policy would permit certain acos whose agreement periods began july 1, 2019 or january 1, 2020 to elect to reduce the amount of their repayment mechanisms. we appreciate cms\u2019s ongoing efforts to minimize burdens associated with the repayment mechanism. we support both of cms\u2019s repayment proposals and encourage the agency to finalize them as proposed. at the same time, we also encourage the agency to take additional steps to further reduce the burdens associated with repayment mechanism requirements. many acos cite the burden and cost of securing a repayment mechanism as primary barriers against moving to a risk-based aco model. to eliminate third party transactional fees that detract from investments in patient care, we urge cms to remove the repayment mechanism requirement when an aco can demonstrate that it has an investor or financial backer with a high credit rating. financial backers could include outside investors, insurers, or hospitals or health systems that are aligned with the aco and committed to providing financial support should losses occur. this flexibility would protect acos\u2019 finances, as well as the federal fisc, and eliminate the need for a 24-month tail period, which is an additional burden on acos. at the very least, if cms continues to require a repayment mechanism, we encourage the agency to minimize associated regulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for a tail period, which is increasingly important in light of longer agreement periods.", "134": "aahpm appreciates cms\u2019 interest in developing a reporting mechanism for mips apm participants that would reduce reporting burden and encourage continued apm participation under its proposed apm performance pathway (app), as well as in streamlining reporting requirements for participants under the medicare shared savings program (mssp). however, we believe cms missed an important opportunity to encourage appropriate care for patients by failing to propose measure #47, advance care plan, in the app quality measure set. as noted above, advance care planning services are essential to ensuring high-quality care for medicare beneficiaries, particularly those with serious illness or at the end of life. these discussions enable care teams to understand patients\u2019 values and goals in order to guide decisions about care and treatment. studies show that advance care planning also leads to higher patient and family satisfaction with quality of care, less hospitalization, less intensity of treatment near end of life, more hospice use, and a higher likelihood of patients dying in their preferred place, as well as less stress, anxiety, and depression in surviving caregivers. for these reasons, we believe that cms should hold mssp and mips apm participants accountable for performance on the advance care plan measure under the app. we note that this would align with actions cms has taken for other models, where it has recognized the importance of advance care planning services in several models currently underway. for example, the bundled payments for care improvement advanced model assesses participant performance on this measure across all clinical episodes. likewise, the medicare advantage value-based insurance design (ma vbid) model also requires all participating medicare advantage organizations to develop and implement a strategy regarding the delivery of timely aahpm cms-1734-p october 5, 2020 11 wellness and health care planning (whp) services, including advance care planning services, to all enrollees. otherwise, we note that it is difficult for aahpm to assess cms\u2019 app proposal given the lack of information on participation in mips apms and advanced apms by specialty. aahpm strongly encourages cms to increase transparency regarding the extent of specialty participation in each mips apm and advanced apm by including data on specialty-level participation in such models in the annual qpp experience report or through annual rulemaking.", "136": "proposal to replace current ssp quality measure set with app quality measure set we support cms\u2019 efforts to develop quality measure sets that reduce clinician burden and avoid low value measures. however, we have concerns about the app measure set. first, preventive care is a central mission of ssp acos and we are concerned that exclusion of foundational preventive care measures such as aco-19 (colorectal cancer screening) and aco- 20 (breast cancer screening) removes an important mechanism for accurately evaluating the impact of ssp acos on population health. second, we are concerned that one third of the measures under the app are related to utilization (hospital-wide, 30-day, all-cause unplanned readmission (hwr) rate for the mips eligible clinician groups and all-cause unplanned admissions for patients with multiple chronic conditions (mcc)). such a heavy emphasis on utilization in the app quality set is unnecessary given the direct financial incentive to control utilization in the ssp, and also given that the measurement of quality performance would be better served through preventive care measures as described above. additionally, the hwr and mcc measures have tight performance distributions. as a result, small differences in quality that may be due to natural statistical variation rather than care delivery can have disproportionate impacts on program performance, resulting in quality scores that do not accurately reflect ssp aco quality.", "137": "changes to quality thresholds we support cms\u2019 aim to drive improvements in the quality of care furnished by acos, and we generally support raising quality performance thresholds over time. we support the proposal for acos who completely report and are at or above the 40th percentile to receive the full maximum savings rate. we believe this supports cms\u2019 stated goal of encouraging apm participation, and will act as a quality improvement incentive. if the proposal to raise the minimum attainment level from the 30th percentile to the 40th percentile is finalized, we recommend applying this as an average of all measures rather than to each measure individually. this is important both because of the concerns with the app quality measures described above, and because the all-or-nothing approach proposed will create circumstances in which acos fail to share in savings through natural statistical variation rather than true poor performance. for example, an aco in the 39th percentile on one quality measure but in the 95th percentile on all others may be locked out of shared savings completely. we are concerned about this all-or-nothing approach and are certain that such an abrupt cutoff will deter apm participation. accordingly, we recommend that if an aco completely reports and does not meet the minimum performance level, the maximum shared savings rate should be multiplied by the quality score as it is today. in this way the aco will receive shared savings proportionate to their quality performance, and acos that do not meet the threshold for a measure with narrow distribution or due to natural statistical variation will not be unduly punished.", "138": "proposal to change the mssp extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy for acos we support the proposal to change the mssp extreme and

also support the exclusion of advance care planning codes billed in inpatient settings from assignment methodology. telehealth regulatory flexibilities related to telehealth have helped us continue to provide high quality care to our patients during the pandemic, and we thank cms for quickly enacting these changes. the pandemic has forever altered health care delivery, and for this reason we strongly recommend that cms make permanent the telehealth flexibilities extended during the phe.", "142": "although we do not know the total impact, our biggest concern with removing the web interface as a reporting mechanism is cost. to report similar cqm type measures, large practices are left only with registry reporting as an option, if they are not set up to report via ehr. the majority of qcdr or qrs charge per provider and that could have a significant budgetary impact on these practices. alerting these practices in late 2020, would not give them enough time to change budgets and participation strategies already set for next year. if cms opts to finalize its proposal to sunset the web interface reporting option, we request that it at least delay this decision by a year to give practices time to prepare for this transition.", "143": "in this rule, cms proposed to establish an alternative payment pathway (app) under which an eligible clinician participating in medicare shared savings program (mssp) could meet the quality reporting requirements of the merit-based incentive payment system (mips) by reporting on one set of quality measures. we have long supported streamlining requirements for providers in at-risk arrangements and have suggested in the past that providers participating in these arrangements should be allowed to report fewer quality measures.", "144": "we applaud cms\u2019s proposal to remove the cms web interface collection type. we agree with cms\u2019s comments in the proposed rule that there is a need for specific-specialty information from large multispecialty groups. under the current mips program, these large multispecialty groups report only primary care measures on a limited number of patients under the web interface reporting method. it is important that cms require specialty reporting from these large groups to ensure accountability for the quality of specialty care at large multi-specialty practices. we strongly support requiring large multi-specialty groups to report on specialty measures, and we further ask cms to encourage participation among these large groups in specialty-led qcdrs. specialty-led qcdrs provide a valuable and unique source of specialty-specific quality data that is not collected elsewhere and is critical to understanding the entire value equation. without incentives for large, multi-specialty practices to report on specialty-specific quality metrics, cms is limiting the performance data available to patients regarding the quality of care that specialty doctors provide. we believe this undermines cms\u2019s efforts to encourage specialists to meaningfully engage in mips.", "145": "in november of 2017, cms published an extreme and uncontrollable circumstances (euc) interim final rule in response to the wildfires and hurricanes maria, irma, and harvey. the academy applauds cms\u2019s continued commitment to ensuring that clinicians affected by major disasters receive automatic extreme and uncontrollable circumstances exceptions, we are concerned, however, that the policy is not being applied as finalized. the policy, as finalized, provided automatic mips extreme and uncontrollable circumstances hardship exemptions to clinicians impacted by a cms-designated extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, including fema-declared major disasters and cms-declared emergencies. when cms finalized that the exception would be automatic, the rationale was that clinicians in these areas are already burdened by major disaster and caring for vulnerable patients who are also vulnerable after major disasters. while the academy appreciates cms\u2019s desire to encourage quality reporting under mips, we are concerned with cms\u2019s approach of not applying the automatic euc policy to the covid19 public health emergency (phe) in performance year 2020. cms has identified covid-19 as a current emergency, fema has declared covid-19 to be a major disaster across the country, and cms is applying the euc policy automatically to mssp organizations that do not report or inadequately report quality during the 2020 performance year due to covid19. we would also note that cms provided an automatic euc to clinicians that did not report 2019 mips due to the covid-19 phe. 8 we would highlight that the reporting period took place near the beginning of the pandemic\u2019s course in the united states. since that time, the healthcare sector\u2019s financial stability has negatively impacted by the reduction or cessation of elective procedures and a sharp decline in outpatient visits (in person or telehealth).3 most practices have had to lay off or furlough clinical workers and administrative staff to remain open.4,5 it will take years for the healthcare sector to recover. despite this, and despite the likely significant impacts the pandemic and resultant delays in care will have on quality performance, cms has stated that the covid-19 phe does not qualify for the automatic euc. with so many healthcare providers struggling financially to stay open and expending all of their focus on the patients who need them, removing the potential for an up to 9% penalty for providers that are truly struggling could allow them to remain open. the more practices that close, the further increased barriers to care will be, which would greatly decrease care quality, particularly during a pandemic. we encourage cms to apply the automatic mips euc policy to the covid-19 phe for the 2020 mips performance year to allow clinicians to be able to focus on the covid-19 phe and their patients without worrying.", "146": "health efilings supports cms\u2019 proposal to establish an apm performance pathway (app). aligning the reporting under the mips program provides more consistent and reliable information and by implementing the proposals related to app reporting, cms will eliminate the burden certain organizations were subject to through the requirements of reporting through the web interface for a greater number of quality measures than practices not participating within an apm. in addition, the alignment of app reporting with the mips program will minimize the barrier of practices transitioning to an apm. [...] health efilings agrees with cms\u2019 proposal to eliminate the cms web interface reporting option. as previously stated, we agree that moving towards a consistent methodology for reporting, especially ones that further the objective of cms to increase the utilization of technology like cehrt, will reduce clinician burden and provide cms with more reliable data.", "147": "while health efilings supports the proposal to align apm reporting to traditional mips reporting, the inclusion of two administrative claims measures is counterproductive to cms\u2019 goal of utilizing technology to improve patient care and reduce costs. cms has previously stated that desire to remove silos from the mips program. health efilings commends cms for including ecqms within the app quality measures and recommends that cms build upon this by replacing the administrative claims measures with ecqms. the ecqms fundamentally tie the use of technology to the quality category by encouraging the proper use of ehrs. additionally, this provides the benefit of increased reliability on the data based upon not having human manipulation or intervention between the documentation and reporting to cms. under mips, cms has eliminated claims-based reporting for large practices due to the data not being reliable or cost-effective for a practice to capture. including administrative claims measures within the apm reporting is counterintuitive to this and ecqms could better serve cms\u2019 needs within the apm reporting quality measure list.", "148": "we have participated in the several rulemaking cycles related to the mssp, most recently with the pathways to success initiative in cy 2019.15 here the agency makes numerous proposals related to the mssp, some for py2020 and py2021 in relation to the phe, and others for subsequent pys beyond the presumed conclusion of the phe.16 we do not address each of these in detail here, but rather direct the agency to public commentary submitted by our colleagues at naacos, aamc, and aha. in short, we generally support efforts to bring mssp calculations, including benchmarking, attribution, quality measurement, and financial performance, into line with the medicare program as transformed by the phe and its related waivers. in particular, we commend the agency for its proposals to expand primary care services to include those provided virtually under a waiver, and to factor those services into attribution calculations for individual beneficiaries and participating acos. we strongly recommend the agency forego any other changes for py2020 or py2021 given the uncertain duration of the phe and the potential for future waivers or other rulemaking (or congressional action) to address a pandemic possibly persisting beyond py2021. permanent changes for py2022 can be considered next year, assuming the phe\u2019s conclusion is at least in sight.", "151": "as noted above, ascension\u2019s mssp acos were also able to leverage cms\u2019s expanded definition of \u201cprimary care services\u201d, which temporarily includes codes for virtual check-ins, e-visits, and telephone communication, for purposes of establishing and maintaining patient attribution to acos. this has allowed for more accurate assignment of beneficiaries throughout the pandemic. and since we anticipate that these services will continue to be readily offered by our aco clinicians and utilized by beneficiaries, we strongly support cms\u2019s proposal to make permanent this revised definition. we also echo the recommendation made by naacos that cms use a two-year assignment window for mssp to account for potential variations in attribution in 2020 and 2021. changes in patient behavior in response to concerns about covid-19, and especially in light of the upcoming flu season, have resulted in healthy patients forgoing and continuing to forgo routine primary care. these behavioral shifts will invariably impact assignment for mssp acos, regardless of whether they use retrospective or prospective attribution. we therefore encourage cms to consider patient visits from both 2019 and 2020 for purposes of all acos\u2019 assignment lists. this will help create more consistent and accurate assignment lists.", "152": "we appreciate cms\u2019s ongoing efforts to minimize burdens associated with the repayment mechanism. we support both of cms\u2019s

least, if cms continues to require a repayment mechanism, we encourage the agency to minimize associated regulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for a tail period, which is increasingly important in light of longer agreement periods.", "153": "cms proposes to retire the cms web interface. under this policy, acos would be required to report electronic clinical quality measures (ecqms) via an electronic health record (ehr) or mips cqms via a qualified registry or qualified clinical data registry (qcdr). we recommend that the sunsetting of the cms web interface be delayed. this will allow providers more time to prepare for a full year of data collection using an alternate submission method through the ehr. waiving the hcahps 2020 survey due to the covid-19 pandemic, cms is proposing several flexibilities for mssp to help alleviate the burden on providers. these flexibilities include automatically giving all providers full points for the hospital consumer assessment of healthcare providers and systems (hcahps) within the patient experience domain for performance year 2020. while ahpa supports the proposal to waive the hcahps survey for 2020, we request that cms finalize this policy before this final rule is released either through a separate guidance or memorandum. hcahps surveys are scheduled to be sent out to patients around december, which is the same time period in which the final rule is expected to be released. without a finalized policy, providers and vendors will be pressured to launch the survey, as they will not know with certainty whether cms will finalize the proposed policy. knowing cms\u2019 final policy earlier will allow providers and vendors to better manage their resources. revising the methodology used to assign beneficiaries to acos during the covid-19 phe, cms added to the definition of primary care used in the mssp assignment methodology codes for remote evaluations, virtual check-ins, e-visits and telephone e/m services. cms considered but ultimately declined to propose adding these codes on a permanent basis. ahpa requests that cms reconsider this proposal and would recommend adding these codes on a permanent basis to assign beneficiaries in mssp. we believe the pandemic has changed how primary care is delivered and believe that patients will continue to demand and expect reduced barriers to telehealth access. assigning doctors in mssp on a national provider identification level ahpa also recommends that cms assign doctors to an mssp program on a national provider identifier (npi) level rather than on a tax identification number (tin) level. currently, the mssp program aligns physicians at the tin level, which makes it hard for groups to exclude certain types of providers that are not well suited for case management. the inclusion of these types of providers, including transplant surgeons, oncologists, anesthesiologists and hospitalists, discourages some groups from participating in mssp. to reduce the attrition rate in the program, cms should consider structuring the program similarly to the direct contracting model, which uses npis to target the right type of provider. this would also prevent overlap between the direct contracting model and mssp.", "154": "there has already been significant changes to the structure of the mssp program through the implementation of the new pathways approach. additional changes, particularly changes to measurements, significantly disrupt acos as they continue to adapt to a new program structure. implementing such changes during the phe only complicate matters. this is not to say we oppose modification to and evolution of the program \u2013 rather, we support meaningful review and changes that are difficult to develop and measure during the ongoing phe. we urge cms to not set any date certain to move forward with revisions at this time. rather, we encourage cms to utilize a separate request for information to gather stakeholder input once the phe emergency concludes. this will allow for adequate review and consideration of suggested revisions and weighting of appropriate measures. more specifically, cms has proposed to end the use of the web interface reporting option as well as removing the pay-for reporting year. both the aha and national association of acos (naacos) outline substantial concerns with these two items. we echo their concerns. cms is proposing to eliminate the web interface reporting option because its use outside of the mssp program is limited. as the program is intended to improve the care for medicare beneficiaries, utilizing a different reporting system that includes all-payer data is questionable. additionally, mssp has different measure specifications which could result in different scores even when reporting the same measure title. unfortunately, we do not believe the proposal addresses how to reconcile potential performance differences among acos that may stem from differences in data collection types. additionally, cms is proposing to eliminate the pay-for-reporting for first year of mssp participation, as we well as pay-for-reporting for newly added or significantly revised measures. pay-for-reporting periods give acos the opportunity to ramp up their measurement and improvement capabilities in a sustainable fashion before their shared services or losses are tied to quality performance. significant changes to existing measure specifications require providers to make several of these same adaptations. as mssp acos are scored on improvement over time, it is essential to establish an accurate performance baseline, thus necessitating the continuation of pay-for-reporting. we urge cms to continue both the existing web interface reporting option and pay-forreporting", "155": "integra appreciates cms\u2019s efforts to streamline the scoring and reporting under the new apm performance pathway (app). we have concerns, however, with the way the proposed app methodology changes would impact data collection and reporting. the operational changes necessary to establish a new reporting platform to replace the web-based platform would be daunting, and we are concerned that cms has not provided sufficient time for establishing and testing the new reporting platform, and training physicians  and office staff on the implementation of new platform to report quality data. additional resources would be needed to implement these changes. these operational changes, along with the proposed quality threshold increase, could jeopardize our ability achieve quality performance results and shared savings consistent with our past performance. we are concerned that the timing of proposed changes during the covid -19 pandemic presents an undue hardship for physicians, in light of the uncertainty of the public health emergency (phe). for these reasons, integra recommends that cms should delay implementation of the proposed quality scoring and reporting changes.", "158": "cms proposal: at a high level, the app [alternative performance pathway] would replace the current shared savings

however, we believe that this proposal contradicts the rationale for delaying the mvp pathway due to provider burden associated with covid-19 and also having to learn new reporting requirements. while we understand that this proposal for the participation in an app will be optional, this is a brand new pathway to providers and may be confusing with other changes of sunsetting the apm scoring standard, cms web interface measures, and adding the mips apm type to the participation statuses. greenway supports sun-setting the apm scoring standard and adding mips apm type to the participation statuses under mips, which aligns with the sunset of the cms web interface measures. we believe this will help achieve consistency in the 2021 reporting period and reducing provider burden. greenway

have significant concerns with moving to the alternative payment model performance pathway (app) for the 2021 performance year and thus respectfully urge cms to delay this transition until after the conclusion of the covid-19 public health emergency (phe). first, we feel the timeline is too aggressive and does not offer participants enough time for transition. asking acos to shift to a new platform for the 2021 performance year places an undue administrative burden on organizations already struggling to cope with the myriad challenges posed by the covid-19 phe. we are particularly concerned that losing the current submission option will create undue additional work and financial burden for acos with participants using multiple types of electronic medical records (emrs). as there is significant preparation needed on the operations and logistical side for this data system migration, we feel that the move from the web interface to the new platform should incorporate a more gradual on-ramp than the timeline proposed by cms. a more protracted transition period critically would allow acos the time they need to engage with any needed new vendors, work with multiple emr companies, create workflows that sustain the new data collection process, and implement any other changes that are necessary to successfully transition to the new platform. aah strongly shares the agency\u2019s goal of promoting and fostering a successful aco program; however, movement to the app while acos continue to address the ongoing challenges of the covid-19 pandemic simply does not create the optimal structure for success and therefore aah respectfully urges cms to delay the transition to app beyond the 2021 performance year. second, it is our understanding the electronic clinical quality measures (ecqms) and the merit-based incentive payment system (mips) cqms require data submissions on all patients, all payors. however, due to privacy protections, acos cannot have access to patient information outside of their attributed mssp patients. this new data submission process therefore provides a layer of complexity and potential liability for acos to report all

resources to implement workflows so that data can be appropriately collected and accurately capture the care provided \u2013 and for providers to review and understand the data to help inform quality improvement efforts going forward. the pay-for-reporting year and for individual measure changes importantly provides this ramp up opportunity for acos to be successful with quality reporting. this appropriate and necessary transitional year helps to ensure there are no unintended consequences or flaws in the measure\u2019s specifications before holding an aco accountable for performance in the

interface reporting mechanism proposal: cms proposes to eliminate the web interface as a reporting method for acos and all mips reporters beginning in 2021, citing low uptake of use outside the aco program. in place of the web interface, the app would require acos to actively report on three clinical quality measures, which could be reported using a registry or direct via electronic health records (ehrs) using electronic clinical quality measure (ecqm) standards. these ecqms must be reported for all patients, regardless of payer.  comments: cms proposes to abruptly end the use of the web interface reporting mechanism, a tool that has been used since the mssp\u2019s inception. removing this option for the nhn aco with little notice is ill-timed and unfair. cms has not been clear regarding how the alternative mips reporting options will be utilized for acos (as apm entities) specifically. there are several key questions and obstacles to moving away from this reporting method in this timeframe. for example, the current remaining mips reporting options available under the app would be registry (mips cqms) and ehr (ecqms). using these reporting options would result in the nhn being evaluated on quality for all patients the nhn\u2019s providers serve, not only aco assigned patients. this is not a true evaluation of the aco\u2019s quality efforts and, additionally, raises contractual and legal concerns, as an aco may not have the ability to access patient data for non-aco patients. nhn providers have invested significant resources for development of reporting processes and workflows to optimize this process; removing web interface reporting option altogether would undermine these investments, thus diverting critical resources away from improving patient care. additionally, cms has not stated if aggregation of data and performance calculations will happen at the cms level. current web interface reporting allows for aggregation of performance across the aco and supports one data file submission. reporting via the ecqm method may not be possible if aco participants have differing electronic medical records (emrs). current state ecqm reporting creates an aggregate report per tin. acos can have many different participating tins, all of which could have different emrs. if aggregation of data and performance doesn\u2019t happen at the cms level, acos would need to employ a third party data aggregation vendor in order to submit one data file at the apm entity level. this could add additional cost to acos. cms should consider a transition away from the web interface reporting option, once consideration is given to performance aggregation at the apm entity level and the option to report ecqms for only the attributed beneficiaries and not all patients and payers. this would align with current structure of reporting only attributed beneficiaries while moving acos away from web interface reporting. for example, cms should work with industry leaders to create qrdaiii aggregate tin level reporting for assigned beneficiaries. then, each tin would submit the qrda iii file via the qpp website and cms would calculate performance scores for the apm entity. currently, practice level reporting is utilized for cpc+ and the upcoming primary care first model. for these reasons, nebraska medicine urges cms to provide a more gradual transition away from the use of the web interface reporting option to give more time and thought to how this will practically be implemented and to give our aco and our providers more time to assess alternatives.", "208": "while we appreciate cms\u2019 efforts to reduce the reporting burden by developing a common set of quality measures regardless of which apm model a clinician or group participates in, we are concerned that these measures will not capture the variability that exists between different specialties. we encourage cms to work with clinicians to ensure that common

time-intensive nature of these services, particularly when managing patients with serious chronic medical conditions.", "212": "however, we have concerns several of the proposals in the rule. dramatically streamlining the number of quality measures on which acos will be assessed, as well as the drastic changes to the method by which acos are assessed, will have negative effects on the

23, makes it more difficult for acos to stand out and earn mips bonuses and shared savings. while it may be appropriate to reduce the burden on providers from reporting quality measures, we are concerned that alternative payment models (apms) would be disadvantaged compared to mips-eligible clinicians not participating in apms. similarly, making changes to the methods for submitting data

quality measures is not fair to participants in acos and other apms participating in mips. while standard mips-eligible clinicians may still have the option of choosing measures on which they will

alternative payment models.   further, including fewer prevention measures is a step in the wrong direction for care quality. while several of these measures that cms proposes retaining have implicit process measures pertaining to prevention, those measures are not as robust as the current set of measures. with these changes, clinicians and patients would lose data from measures such as tobacco use, flu vaccinations, fall risk, and cancer screenings that give a fuller picture of preventive care performance.", "214": "the proposed increase in the quality performance standard could allow acos

for reporting quality in 2020 or move to a new system that would compensate for more critical activities during the public health emergency. the circumstances of the pandemic will make precise differentiation of quality in primary care practices near impossible. using any 2020 quality data for performance evaluation would undercut the legitimacy of the program and we recommend suspending

provide quarterly reports to acos that not only indicate their aco\u2019s performance on this measure, but also include a list of aco members that qualified for the measure denominator (members identified by cms as having multiple chronic conditions). this will allow acos to optimize their internal patient identification processes, driving more targeted improvement on this measure. for other measures on the mssp quality measures slate, such as diabetes: hba1c poor control, cms provides acos with a registry of members that are part of the diabetes cohort. we recommend that cms offer acos a similar registry for the unplanned admissions for multiple chronic conditions measure, which also involves cohort logic. while we support the aforementioned aspects of the app, we would suggest delaying implementation until 2022 or later. if the proposed rule is finalized, acos would have little time to digest the new regulations and, importantly, move to a new reporting process. forcing acos into the app in 2021 may have an inadvertent negative impact on quality if acos cannot adequately review and refine their quality reporting strategies.", "222": "in addition, there are a number of changes that are being proposed in how quality will be evaluated starting in 2021. in the current proposal, performance scoring needs to be at or above the 40th percentile in order to meet the quality performance standard. cms has noted that many acos perform well in quality under the current standards and thereby, increasing the standards to which an aco needs to achieve in order to be eligible to earn shared savings. in addition, currently the cahps for aco questions are counted as 10 individual measures in the patient/caregiver experience domain and in the proposed rule the cahps for mips survey related questions will be counted just as one measure. cms is also proposing to wait until the 2021 reporting is complete to release the 2021 benchmarks. currently, an aco needs to achieve the 30th percentile on at least one measure in each domain to meet the minimum quality standard and be eligible for shared savings. we believe this requirement is achievable since the benchmarks are released early enough during the performance year, helping an aco set goals throughout the year. in addition, there are enough measures in each domain to allow acos to meet the 30th percentile in at least one measure per domain. we believe the proposal to increase the minimum threshold from the 30th to the 40th percentile sets too high of a bar, especially if the 2021 benchmarks are not being released until after the 2021 performance year and the number of measures is reduce to six for 2021. we ask cms to revisit the 40th percentile proposal and keep this at the 30th percentile for 2021. in addition, we ask cms to consider allowing some or all measures to be pay-forreporting for the 2021 performance year due to the current public health emergency. we would also ask that cms continue to award improvement points for acos who are able to increase their performance from one year to the next in order to recognize the work the aco has undertaken to improve their quality score.", "228": "summary of key recommendations: mssp proposals  \u2022 do not finalize proposals to change the way acos are measured on and report quality measures. instead, we urge cms to work with naacos and other stakeholders to make changes to the current quality measure performance evaluation criteria and measure set for acos to further refine the measures and criteria as appropriate for a group of providers who are responsible for total cost of care for the populations they serve.  \u2022 do not reduce the number of clinical quality measures for acos to three measures. while ccpm supports reducing reporting burdens and efforts to eliminate low value measures, these proposals go too far by reducing the number of clinical quality measures to a mere three measures. cms should work with stakeholders to identify the most appropriate set of measures for acos.  \u2022 do not discontinue the use of the web interface as a quality reporting mechanism for mssp

cms does not include any further details regarding how cms would determine if the three required measures were not applicable to the aco. comments: cchi opposes this approach to provide acos the option of selecting alternative quality measures to report. first, we cannot contemplate instances when the proposed app measures listed would be determined to not apply to an aco. second, allowing this option would make program evaluation nearly impossible. evaluating aco\u2019s impact on quality should be a key focus for cms and, therefore, there should be one standard set of quality measures

accountable. adding codes such as \u201ce-visits,\u201d chronic care management, and principal care management will help create a better picture of where patients receive most of their primary care. cms should continue to refine the primary care codes used in assignment, and we request that the agency do so in a timely manner. we recommend cms finalize adding the nine proposed codes to the mssp assignment methodology. cchi also appreciates cms\u2019s desire to ensure that patients are attributed to providers from whom they receive their primary care services. therefore, we support excluding advance care planning services from mssp assignment when billed in an inpatient setting and also excluding professional services furnished by fqhcs or rhcs when delivered in a snf. both of these changes, while technical in nature, help create more complete and accurate patient assignment lists for acos and we recommend the agency finalize these proposals. while cchi appreciates cms\u2019s work to refine assignment during the covid-19 phe, cchi recommends that cms use a two-year assignment window for mssp to account for potential variations in attribution in 2020 and 2021. especially in states hit harder by the pandemic, healthy patients may forego routine primary care and throw off assignment for mssp acos who use either retrospective or prospective attribution. therefore, patient visits from 2019 and 2020 should be considered for acos\u2019 assignment lists regardless if acos choose prospective attribution or retrospective attribution. while the windows for either groups of acos will be different, the same general principle applies and would help create more steady and accurate assignment lists. the next generation aco model uses a two-year assignment window already.",

staff in organizations. the effects of and page 4 of 9 recovery from the revenue reduction will continue over the next several years. removal of cms web interface will increase costs for organizations during this delicate time. a switch to mips cqms and ecqms in a short time period will require contracts with third party vendors at a significant cost to the organization. as opposed to cwi reporting, which was performed in-house without third party vendors and minimal additional cost to our organization. second, as an academic medical system, our budgets are complete as our fiscal year is july to june. the cost increase was not included in the budget and may lead to higher reductions in revenue. the switch to other collection and submission types are very costly and not included in lean budgets. third, the short timeframe to change collection and submission types will not allow for identification and implementation of changes to workflows. for instance, our current electronic medical record does not include billing information. for ecqms, billing information is a vital component for accurate reporting of quality measures. for mips cqms, data within the electronic medical record may be in locations beneficial to cwi reporting, but not for mips cqm reporting. changes to locations of data require workflow changes for clinicians and other staff. if cwi is removed, it is improbable to make these changes in a few months. fourth, personnel have been relocated to telehealth and other staff deployed home, thus there are less on-site resources for changes needed to implement a change to collection and submission types. fifth, we will experience a drop in measure performance by the quick switch in collection types allowing for no opportunity for improvements in workflows and change in clinician documentation. for instance, the preventive care and screening: screening for depression and follow-up plan change to ecqm collection type would result in a 40% drop

the advanced alternative payment model (aapm) incentive payments for those risk-bearing acos and other entities are scheduled to sunset in the next several years and many providers may instead report under mips. for the health equity and cost savings reasons articulated above, quality measurement for diabetes care that incorporates autonomous ai and other innovative, fda-cleared technologies

concerned about survey fatigue among our patients. our survey response rates and the survey response rates of health systems around the country have been declining in years past because of the burden of patient surveys. in addition, the medicare beneficiaries surveyed are a small subset of our total medicare beneficiaries and an even smaller subset of our total patient panel. therefore, we ask cms

points in 2019. after careful consideration and analysis, our physician leaders determined it was best for one aco to adopt pathway c and another to adopt the enhanced track. now, our team is concerned. cms is proposing to implement a number of significant changes \u2013 introduced during the first year of a five-year program \u2013 that could negatively impact the shared savings acos utilize to fund care delivery both inside and outside the physician\u2019s office", "263": "medicare shared savings program \u2022 we support allowing full credit in the quality program for the

challenges administering the survey caused by this year\u2019s public health emergency.", "264": "quality program \u2022 privia supports the reduction of quality measures and streamlining the reporting for physicians participating in value-based models (mips and mssp). overall, privia supports cms\u2019 goal to simplify the quality program and make measures more consistent across mips and mssp. this will create focus and reduce administrative burden. while the change standardizes measures across mips and mssp, it does not standardize with medicare advantage stars. providers will continue to have to manage disparate quality measures across programs. privia\u2019s recommendation is to fully align mips, mssp and medicare advantage stars measures for simplicity", "265": "privia opposes the \u201call-or-nothing\u201d proposed revisions to establishing the final shared savings rate. entering into the mssp program already involves a significant amount of uncertainty and risk. there is downside risk associated with certain aco tracks, and also the risk of not achieving any shared savings. this is a critical issue for acos who incur up-front, and ongoing, infrastructure costs to successfully care for their communities with no direct reimbursement from cms to cover those investments. earned shared savings is the only financial source acos rely on to fund those resources. the change from a quality multiplier on payment, to an all-or-nothing savings, adds another significant dimension of risk to the program. this change, combined with higher standards and volatile measures, place the entirety of an aco\u2019s bonus at risk if one measure is missed. overall, this proposed change would negatively impact our decision to continue participating in our current mssp tracks, enter into new mssp arrangements - including increased downside risk - and our overall investments in the program. privia suggests that any new quality scoring methodology be preceded by existing reporting and benchmarking as a general principle.", "266": "privia does not support the change from composite to measure-by-measure success. cms is proposing to move from a composite measurement across all measures (e.g. quality score of 95%), to determining success of an aco measure-bymeasure (e.g. no payment if an aco misses 1 of 6 measures). this creates an unnecessarily high standard for acos to be strong performers across every domain, without issue. compounding the fact that without established benchmarks or current year performance on the selected measures this will be highly problematic for acos. instead, cms should be incentivizing increases on quality across a composite of all measures. this eliminates the risk of not performing on a single measure, impacting the entire aco. undoubtedly, the public health emergency has made a significant impact on in-person appointments for cy 2020, especially mammograms and colonoscopies screening for all beneficiaries. failure on those measures, due to several months of elective screenings and procedures being cancelled would remove all opportunity for savings. as an analogy, experienced investors aim to create a diversified portfolio that is not overly reliant on any single investment to perform. similarly, acos need to have a diversified portfolio of quality measures to be successful in aggregate.", "267": "privia opposes the increased weight of claims-based measures. compounding upon the issues above is the greater weight placed on claimsbased measures, specifically readmissions. privia understands the importance of managing readmissions, but readmissions are low volume, claim based measures subject to high volatility and influenced by many factors outside a providers\u2019 influence. based on our data, the spectrum between high and low performance is very tight for readmissions. for example, in 2019 the aco readmission rate for the 90th percentile was 14.6, while the 40th percentile (new proposed minimum) was 15.62. this creates an effective range of a little over 1% for acos to succeed or fail.  in addition, our providers have been successful in keeping our emergency room visits and inpatient admissions low. this creates an unintended consequence that increases the sensitivity of this calculation because our base number of admissions is low compared to other acos with high numbers of admissions. privia\u2019s recommendation is to change the measure to ambulatory sensitive condition acute composite and/or provide acos more detailed and timely information about readmissions beyond the summary quarterly reports.", "268": "privia does not support the increase in minimum quality measures. while privia supports increasing standards for acos, the increase in standard from 30th percentile to 40th percentile, combined with the other quality changes, unnecessarily penalize acos who may not perform well on a single measure", "269": "privia opposes the change to using the same year for quality benchmarks as the performance year. while we understand the rationale for choosing benchmarks to match the performance period, performing in quality is difficult when you do not know your target. this change, in effect, lowers the visibility of acos who want to understand what they need to achieve.", "270": "privia does not support the removal of the web reporting interface privia supports the long-term transition to electronic submission of quality measures, in order to reduce provider group burden. however, this goal is more vision than reality today. the proposed change would come into effect january 2021, which leaves little time for acos to make needed changes. in privia\u2019s case, despite having our providers on a single electronic health record (ehr), ehrs are not yet suited to support electronic reporting of measures without the need for manual chart review for unstructured data points or data that remains in legacy ehr archives. even with the intent to simplify the process, the change itself leads to administrative burden for groups who have infrastructure around the existing process. privia recommends keeping the current cms web reporting interface in place for py 2021 and that the first year under the new reporting structure be pay-forreporting to allow groups to manage through the change.", "271": "privia opposes the proposed advanced alternative payment model (a-apm) bonus eligibility changes. the increase in payment and patient thresholds to achieve the a-apm bonus are too significant of changes within too short of a timeframe. as stated earlier, organizations such as privia make five-year decisions when choosing aco track participation. for example, privia\u2019s mid-atlantic aco decided to participate in the highest risk, enhanced track. part of that decision was the confidence that we would achieve the a-apm bonus, which would ultimately mitigate potential losses, if they occurred. while we understand that cms must increase standards, acos need more time to plan and adapt to the proposed changes. we recommend delaying and/or reducing the standards for the a-apm bonus.  we are in agreement and support of many proposed revisions, including the recommended evaluation and management (e&m) changes that will promote improvement in the overall patient experience by decreasing administrative burden. we also greatly appreciate cms\u2019 extensive expansion of medicare telehealth policies during the pandemic, and the ongoing efforts to make these changes

emergency for performance year (py) 2020.", "273": "1. py 2020: quality performance should be pay-for-reporting across all measures for py2020; if cms implements any pay-for-performance measures, quality should be the higher of 2019 national mean, 2019 aco actual or aco\u2019s 2020 actuals. many experts predict a second wave of covid-19 starting in the autumn as colder weather drives more people indoors and many schools begin bringing students back for full or part time face-to-face instruction. our hospitals are already experiencing slight upticks in covid related volume. this would significantly narrow the window of opportunity to deliver routine care especially to those over 65 with high risk conditions. many patients only feel safe by avoiding interacting with the health care system. for the remainder of 2020, hospitals, group practices, and individual providers will be focused on urgent or emergent patients, as well as protecting themselves, their staff, and other patients from the coronavirus. while cms has expanded telehealth coverage for medicare acos, many quality measures cannot be properly met in a remote setting (e.g., immunizations, mammography). due to uncontrollable circumstances, aco quality performance should be measured on a pay-for-reporting basis for py2020. please see the quality measure grid on last page for more detail. if cms does include any pay-for performance measures for py 2020, then steward recommends that all 2020 mssps should receive for each measure the higher of the 2019 mean quality score across all 2019 acos, the aco\u2019s 2019 actual performance or the aco\u2019s actual measure performance for performance year 2020. using the same year (2020) national mean for quality measures will not have the intended effect of the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy. by taking the 2019 national mean for measures in domains 2, 3, and 4, it will significantly reduce the adverse impact of covid-19 and mitigate the disproportional impact different acos experience depending on the state(s) the majority of their aco members reside in. for example, acos with a large rural population already have advanced telehealth and remote patient monitoring capabilities and are better equipped to manage patients during a global pandemic. however, acos with patients predominantly located in urban service areas have lesser developed telehealth functionality.", "274": "py 2021: cms should not reduce the number of measures nor raise the minimum percentile requirements for acos to share in savings. we recommend cms leave the regulation as it is currently, where acos must completely and accurately report all measures and achieve at, or above, the 30th percentile on one measure in each domain to be eligible to share in savings. holding providers accountable for a wide range of measures leads to broader quality improvement for more patients with varying conditions. a significant cut to the number of measures could potentially lead to reduced efforts from providers, a spike in inpatient admissions and utilization, and most importantly, an overall decrease in patient quality of care. additionally, cms should not implement a performance floor during a transitional year: performance benchmarks will change to mips program benchmarks, which are calculated on historical mips data, from aco program benchmarks. based on the disruption that covid- 19 has caused to 2019 reporting, and is anticipated for 2020, cms expects to release the benchmarks retrospectively (after performance rates have been calculated). because of this, the proposed rule essentially requires acos to achieve the 40th percentile without knowing what that benchmark will be in advance of the performance period.by increasing the minimum quality thresholds from the 30th to 40th percentile for all measures, cms is jeopardizing acos\u2019 ability to share in savings which directly threatens long-term sustainability of medicare aco programs going forward. using the latest 2019 mssp publicly available data, approximately 300 acos (55%) would have been ineligible to share in savings if the proposed 40th percentile minimum threshold rule was in place during that time for the proposed five measure set, excluding the cahps survey measure. of those 300 acos, 148 earned shared savings in py2019 totaling approximately $650 million in shared savings that would have been forfeited. medicare aco programs can be very costly to operationalize, and with an increased chance of earning zero shared savings, this proposal has unintended consequences mainly leading to reduced aco participation.", "275": "py 2021: cms should continue using the quality reporting web interface system and should not switch to mips reporting. under the proposed rule, acos would have to use an entirely new data source to report performance. electronic emr data would be submitted and the data would be all-payer data not just the managed fee-for-service medicare population. this proposal would put come at a significant cost, especially for acos who do not use a single emr. acos would need more time than the rule contemplates to determine whether the emr functionality at each practice throughout their network is robust enough to support all-payer performance for each provider. steward has made significant investments in centralizing our medicare aco data and reporting in one consolidated data warehouse that supports coordination of care across the continuum of care. centralization allows an aco to integrate data from a wide array of data sources \u2013 including claims, clinical records, patient experience, community services, care management and ancillary services \u2013 that can be used to match patients to aco resources as well as reduce waste and overutilization to achieve improved access, cost, and quality goals. this centralization also supports complete and accurate reporting at the aco-level. decentralizing quality reporting to reflect the current apm emr-level reporting will undermine the established infrastructure and result in underreporting of quality performance. lastly but

proposes to eliminate the web interface as a reporting method for acos and all mips reporters beginning in 2021, citing low uptake of use outside the aco program. in place of the web interface, the app would require acos to actively report on three clinical quality measures, which could be reported using a registry or direct via electronic health records (ehrs) using electronic clinical quality measure (ecqm) standards. these ecqms must be reported for all patients, regardless of payer. comments: cms proposes to abruptly end the use of the web interface reporting mechanism, a tool that has been used since the mssp's inception. removing this option for all acos with little notice is ill-timed and unfair. we agree with naacos' views on moving to a registry or ehr-based reporting method. moving to a registry or ehr-based reporting method will significantly increase the number of patients an aco must report on and be evaluated on under cms proposals. currently, acos must report on 248 aco patients included in the web interface. under the registry option, an aco would have to report on 60 percent of their patients, both medicare and non-medicare patients as well as aco and non-aco patients. for the ehr reporting method, acos would be required to report on 70 percent of patients, both medicare and non-medicare as well as aco and non-aco patients. for some acos this could be a drastic increase and will therefore add significant administrative burden for the aco. should cms finalize this approach, the agency should be requiring the aco to report on, at a maximum, 50 percent of exclusively aco patients. these specification issues and differences demonstrate why we feel an aco-tailored approach to quality measurement and assessment is more appropriate than trying to make the mips program and standards apply to acos.", "284": "we are also pleased to see cms remove the requirement for acos to field a cahps for acos survey in 2020 and provide full points automatically

centers (fqhcs) or rural health centers (rhcs) when those services are delivered in a skilled nursing facility (snf).   comments: we support updating the definition of primary care codes used for mssp assignment. assignment is a critical program methodology that determines the beneficiary population for which an aco is held accountable. adding codes such as \"e-visits,\" chronic care management, and principal care management will help create a better picture of where patients receive most of their primary care. cms should continue to refine the primary care codes used in assignment, and we

proposes that an aco that is otherwise eligible to share in savings meets the propose quality performance standard, the aco would share in savings at the maximum sharing rate according to the applicable financial model and up to the performance payment limit. these revisions would apply to all tracks.  if an aco meets the quality performance standard, cms would determine the loss rate by: \uf0b7 step 1: calculating the quotient of the mips quality performance category points earned divided by the total mips quality performance category points available \uf0b7 step 2: calculating the product of the quotient in step 1 and the sharing rate for the relevant track \uf0b7 step 3: calculating the shared loss rate as 1 minus the product determined in step 2  an aco with a higher quality score would owe a lower amount of losses compared to an aco with an equivalent amount of losses but a lower quality score, assuming the aco\u2019s quality score results in a shared loss rate within the range between the minimum shared loss rate and the maximum shared loss rate. should the aco\u2019s quality score result in a shared loss rate outside the limits, the shared loss rate is set to the minimum or maximum rate, as applicable.  an aco that fails to meet the quality performance standard would be ineligible to share in savings and would owe the maximum amount of shared losses.  response

well as patient experience. these measures should not be unduly burdensome for providers, and they should generally be calculated or administered by cms, preferably with data that are already

scoring caps for \u201ctopped out\u201d measures would not apply, though those measures may be removed in future performance years. web interface would be removed as a reporting option, so mssp acos would select one of the other available mechanisms to report quality data. under the new app, all mssp acos would be scored on six static quality measures (instead of 23) and actively report three measures (instead of 10). the cahps for mips survey, which currently counts as 10 separate measures and comprises 25 percent of the mssp quality score, would count as one measure. acp comments: in general, acp appreciates the spirit of this proposal to streamline quality reporting and minimize burden on mssp acos. we also support a number of the individual proposals. however, we do have concerns with some proposals about several potential unintended consequences.  most acutely, we are concerned about the proposed implementation timeline, particularly given the delayed release of the final rule and the covid-19 phe. acp urges cms to delay any proposed mssp quality reporting changes until the 2022 performance year, particularly removing web interface as an available reporting option. mssp acos have been reporting via web interface since the program\u2019s start. many may have limited familiarity with other reporting options. moreover, many acos are complex networks of different practices, hospitals, and health systems. it will take time to evaluate alternative options, sign a new vendor contract, and implement a coordinated roll out across all of these entities. less than 60 days\u2019 notice is an insufficient window of time to implement these changes successfully, especially during a global pandemic. additionally, web interface requires reporting on a sample of the first 248 consecutively assigned patients. the majority of other reporting methods require reporting on 60-70 percent of all eligible patients across payers, which would represent a massive increase in reporting burden, which again, comes at a particularly inopportune time with the covid-19 pandemic. this would mean acos would have to collect this data from each of its participating tins, which would likely entail transitioning them all to the same ehr, qcdr, or qualified registry platform \u2013 a potential logistical nightmare with untold rippling effects on expense and reporting disruption that may force practices to re-evaluate their participation in the aco. removing the web interface reporting option and finalizing the other mssp quality reporting changes within the proposed timeframe risks possible wide-scale quality reporting disruptions for mssp acos.", "302": "we are also concerned about potential implications that evaluating mssp acos on mips benchmarks would have both for acos and other mips eligible clinicians, which is exacerbated by the fact that web interface would no longer be an available reporting option. currently, all acos

the same measure. acos are large, sophisticated, and complex systems with unique attributes that distinguish them from individual clinicians or group practices. including them in benchmarks calculations for other mips reporting modalities may drastically alter benchmarks for other mips eligible clinicians and further exacerbate the performance gap between small practices and larger health systems. at the very least, for a change of this magnitude, the agency should provide more data, ideally modeling past performance data that compares how benchmarks under the proposed new methodology would compare to the current methodology, both for mssp acos and general mips benchmarks. cms should also give stakeholders time to evaluate this information, consider the full impact of these proposals, and provide more detailed feedback. at this time, we urge cms to reverse its proposal to align mssp quality benchmarks with mips benchmarks", "303": "as noted in the app section, acp has concerns about the inflexibility of cms\u2019 proposal to require all clinicians reporting under the app to report the same six quality measures. while acp greatly appreciates cms being responsive to stakeholder calls to reduce reporting burden, we worry that reducing the mssp quality measures set from 23 to six measures in one performance year is a drastic change with an unforeseeable impact on quality scoring for acos. it also omits entire categories of quality assessment that help to drive positive patient outcomes, such as vaccinations or cancer screenings. the college suggests a more gradual, phased reduction in which cms would remove measures in rounds based on level of priority and evaluate the impact before proceeding with removing additional measures", "304": "acp also has technical concerns with the six specific measures proposed, as explained in our comments on the app. the following measures in the current aco measure set were rated by acp\u2019s pmc as valid. acp

comments: acp does not support all-or-nothing approaches to quality scoring and supports cms\u2019 proposal to no longer automatically give acos zero points for the entire quality category if they fail to report a single required measure. we feel that awarding zero points for failure to report applicable, required measures is an appropriate compromise. we also support cms\u2019 proposal not to

to incentivize reporting, such as adjusting savings similar to losses by multiplying the maximum possible savings by the percentage of total months and beneficiaries affected. acp comments: while acp appreciates cms\u2019 goal to incentivize reporting, acp strongly opposes cms\u2019 changes to the mssp extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy as proposed, which would effectively lower the protections for impacted acos and comes at a particularly tumultuous time with covid-19. acp would support a similar policy that would apply the higher of either score, provided the agency maintains the same baseline level of protection, i.e. the mean aco score. this would maintain current levels of protection, which is particularly critical during the midst of a global pandemic, while incentivizing acos to report data to improve their quality scores", "312": "proposal to use the higher of either 2019/2020 for an aco\u2019s quality score  we cannot stress enough that cms should move forward with this proposal. covid-19 in 2020 has caused unprecedented havoc in terms of capturing clinical information necessary for the quality metrics cms has assigned to acos. example\u2014for both the dm a1c and htn measures, cms does not allow any patient-reported data to count towards the numerator. how can this possibly work in a pandemic era when most patients forgo visits involving physical interaction?  therefore, it is not reasonable to expect acos to be able to accurately report quality measure information when the base infrastructure to collect that information has completely changed due to a pandemic. instead, cms should either: (1) use the higher of the 2019 or 2020 scores; or (2) make all 2020 measures pay-for-reporting (except for cahps, which is already

critical components of value-based care. through patient attribution, responsibility for the quality and costs of the care delivered to that patient for a specific performance period and under value-based contracts, the patient attribution process defines a provider\u2019s risk pool, influences medical loss ratio, and determines whether a provider will realize shared savings or losses and how those funds or penalties are allocated. as patients seek telehealth services from providers at their own convenience, the potential for care to be given to patients by providers who specialize exclusively in telehealth and do not have an ongoing longitudinal relationship with a primary care physician is high. as a result, these telehealth-only providers could possibly conduct services such as virtual annual wellness visits that would not be properly attributed and disrupt the continuum of care and attribution data as a result. it is important to ensure that patients are accurately

cms proposes to remove the web interface reporting mechanism for acos, mips apms, group practices, and virtual groups starting with the 2021 performance year.  mgma comment: we oppose the proposal to sunset the web interface reporting mechanism in 2021 and instead encourage cms to delay this policy until the 2022 performance year at the earliest. while we appreciate that this proposal is intended to provide acos more flexibility by adding new reporting options rather than limiting aco reporting to the web interface, switching to an alternative reporting mechanism takes time and consideration. importantly, retiring the web interface will modify how acos are evaluated on quality measures. when acos report via the web interface, they provide cms with data about medicare beneficiaries that are specific to each web interface measure. in contrast, the remaining mips reporting options available to acos, registry (cqm) and ehr (ecqm), evaluate data on all patients, regardless of payer, that meet measure denominator criteria. therefore, eliminating the web interface option would result in a significant change in how acos are evaluated on quality metrics, since the remaining options consider all patients, rather than a predefined set of patients. more time is needed to evaluate whether this is appropriate and, if so, for acos to understand the implications of this change. additionally, this proposal raises operational questions and concerns. acos moving to cqm or ecqm may encounter technical difficulties and data-sharing limitations that arise from lack of interoperability. acos often consist of several group practice tins that all work together to achieve the goals of the aco and the program. this entails coordination across multiple practice sites, which may utilize several different ehrs, and in some cases, upwards of a dozen different systems. for an aco that uses multiple systems, the shift away from web interface to cqm or ecqm may require additional capabilities to enable reporting, such as retention of a separate third-party vendor to aggregate patient data across these systems or added functionalities to existing products. this involves not only added expenses but also learning and implementing new workflows. acos and their participant groups need time to make these changes and secure appropriate vendors and/or added technological capabilities within their current systems. they should be afforded an appropriate period of time to consider all available options, rather than being forced to rush into a contract that may not be the best fit but offers the quickest solution.", "333": "mssp: remaining 2020 proposals cms proposal (85 fed. reg. 50252): cms proposes changes to the quality reporting requirements for the

thresholds for billing each calendar month can present a variety of challenges. health care organizations take on considerable additional expense to provide this robust collaborative care team, and need to feel confident that the reimbursement will compensate in a meaningful way. cms has been a champion for this model of care, and we applaud your efforts to facilitate its wider adoption through mechanisms like the proposed 30 minute code. we also strongly endorse the increase in valuation of rvus related to the cocm billing codes. we would like to note, however, that a significant decrease in the conversion factor resulting in decreased reimbursement despite increased rvus will create one more barrier for programs to implement and sustain an evidenced-based cocm program. we also request that cms allow the proposed 30 minute code (gcol1) to be billed in fqhc/rhc practices for the same reasons it will be helpful in standard practices. we work with many fqhc and rhc practices that find the time thresholds for billing the cocm g0512 code challenging to meet consistently within the calendar month, and are often unwilling to implement the model for that reason. the proposed valuation of the 30 minute cocm code is slightly higher than the g0511 general care management code, compensating somewhat for the full team that must be in place to use it. we appreciate your consideration of this request. in conclusion we hope cms can continue their work with health care and behavioral health providers, policy experts, and trainers like the aims center, to find ways to more effectively address the financial barriers to adoption of cocm. the model has a robust evidence base demonstrating improvement in patient outcomes and allows for a broader work force to address the mental health

because it does not adequately consider the competing risk of mortality. providers with higher mortality rates for more severely ill patients could appear to be providing better quality care. concerns have been raised in multiple peer reviewed publications about the possible association between incentives to reduce admission and increased mortality rates.24-28 it is also unclear whether hospital readmission rates truly reflect the quality of care for all patient populations and whether incentivizing lower readmissions could potentially exacerbate disparities in care. admission rates may be modified by providing better quality care or they may be modified by simply increasing the threshold to admit patients who would benefit from admission. thus, they may be measuring differences in admission thresholds or even unmeasured differences in social risk or disease severity and not quality of care. the aha suggests that cms consider a measure such as risk-adjusted home time which, if carefully designed, might better balance the competing risks of readmission and mortality and mitigate some of these concerns. further, cms may want to consider the additional recommendations for improving on readmission measures and reducing the risk of potential inequities and unintended consequences included in the recent paper by psotka et al.28 the aha absolutely supports a systems-level approach by clinicians to better coordinate care across providers and settings of care. however, we are not convinced that holding physician groups accountable for all unplanned readmissions is the

highlight that the reporting period took place near the beginning of the pandemic\u2019s course in the united states. since that time, the healthcare sector\u2019s financial stability has been decimated by the reduction or cessation of elective procedures and a sharp decline in outpatient visits (in person or telehealth).3 most practices and hospitals have had to lay off or furlough

struggling could allow them to remain open. the more practices that close, the further increased barriers to care will be, which would greatly decrease care quality, particularly during a pandemic. we

clarification they are often given incorrect information as the qpp help desk staff does not understand the reporting requirements for mssp acos.  requiring aco participants to submit the promoting interoperability category of mips is a drastic change for acos that took on risk and became advanced apms under mips. for 2020 if the aco meets a \u201cthreshold\u201d our participants do not have to

quality factor that would show up in higher scores on a large number of other measures. or, the choice would be based on a body of science showing that these six measures, above all others, reflect the quality dimensions with the greatest significance to overall population health as assessed by broad measures of life expectancy, functional status, or general wellbeing. none of that appears here. although each measure has some scientific merit as a quality of care measure, none are supported by any solid evidence for some kind of unique standing as a \u201csentinel\u201d quality measure, and

compares acos on the quality of care they provide.  therefore, we do not support this movement to just six quality measures, unless cms can bring forward evidence of the unique standing of these measures as \u201csentinel\u201d quality measures of high significance, and unless cms can enhance the risk adjustment models used in these measures to assure that acos serving either clinically or socially high-risk patient populations are fairly evaluated.", "433": "additionally, moving to the alternative reporting options cms has provided through the proposed apm performance pathway (app) would cause many acos to have to pay for registries and/or ehr upgrades and dashboards to capture the correct data to be able to report to cms.   finally, there are remaining questions regarding how the aco would report the data for non-medicare and non-aco patient data, which is required when reporting using a registry or ehr. this could cause acos to have to revisit contracts and could raise legal concerns as the aco does not typically have access to non-aco patient data.", "435": "chpa also advocates for expansion of telehealth services to include aco waivers for the fqhcs and rhcs. providing these services to the most vulnerable is critical to maintaining and improving the health of our population.", "458": "additionally, chpa opposes the overall approach proposed for aco quality scoring. with upcoming changes to mips through the mips value pathways and exemptions due to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as for covid-19, the 40th percentile of the quality category score could vary greatly from year to year making it a less meaningful indicator of true performance. instead, should cms move forward with proposals to re-design the quality assessment structure for acos, we urge cms to utilize a 7 scoring approach that is more similar to the current domain-based scoring approach instead of using an all-or-nothing approach as proposed. as an example, cms could instead consider a policy that would use a minimum attainment standard that requires 50 percent of the quality measures to meet or exceed the 40th percentile. this must be done in conjunction with our recommendations to add additional clinical quality measures to the measure set beyond the three that cms has currently proposed. setting the standard at 50 percent ensures that acos perform well on a substantial set of measures to earn savings but does not punish acos that miss the mark on a measure that is either not as relevant to their patient population or has a very narrow range of performance rates. finally, chpa also urges cms to better reward high quality performers, as is done in the medicare advantage program by providing bonuses or higher shared savings rates to high quality performers or those that notably improve quality scores over time.", "464": "under the pathways to success regulations when a recalculated repayment mechanism increases by a certain amount (i.e., the lesser of 50 percent or $1,000,000), cms requires the aco to increase the value of the repayment mechanism. however, cms does not currently decrease the repayment mechanism amount when the opposite occurs, a policy for which chpa has advocated and which the agency proposes to change in this rule. we appreciate cms\u2019s proposal to allow acos an option to decrease their repayment mechanism amount if the recalculated amount is less than the current amount, and we request the agency finalize this policy. we also support cms providing an opportunity for acos that renewed their agreements effective in 2019 or 2020 an opportunity to benefit from this policy change, if finalized, by adjusting their repayment mechanism amounts already in place, if they quality under the revised policy.", "476": "as the accountable care organization (aco) that brought this concern to cms, community health center network of idaho (chcni) fully supports the cms proposal to revise the existing exclusion for professional services billed under cpt codes 99304 through 99318 that are furnished in a snf to include services reported on an fqhc or rhc claim that includes those cpt codes, when those services are furnished in a snf. we further support the proposal that this revision would also be applicable to determining aco beneficiary assignment for the performance year starting on january 1, 2021, and subsequent performance years. chcni is comprised solely of federally-qualified health centers (fqhc). the mission of all fqhcs is to provide quality care to anyone, regardless of their ability to pay. the fqhc mission makes the prospect of risk sharing a daunting one, but also in alignment with our commitment to our patients. the medicare shared savings program (mssp) provides an opportunity for healthcare networks like ours to build infrastructure to prepare to participate in risk sharing in value-based contracts. however, the current program exclusion regarding snf claims meant to ensure that acos are being accurately and fairly held accountable for the care of their medicare beneficiaries does not apply to fqhcs due to the their claim submission processes which are different than that of all other primary care providers. since fqhcs do not use place of service codes or other indicators that a claim is eligible for exclusion, their claims are always considered primary care claims, even for snf visits. these claims are then used for aco beneficiary attribution and shared savings methodology, putting fqhc acos at an extreme disadvantage. chcni agrees with cms's belief that it is important to exclude claims for fqhc and rhc services that include cpt codes 99304 through 99318 from use in assignment when there is a snf facility claim with a date of service that overlaps with the date of fqhc or rhc services. consistent with the previously established exclusion for claims billed under these codes when the services are provided to beneficiaries with an overlapping snf stay, we believe it is important to exclude the same services from use in assignment when they are furnished by physicians and npps billing through an fqhc or rhc to beneficiaries in a snf. chcni fully supports the proposed rule that would ensure parity between all acos participating in the medicare shared savings program", "477": "[specifically mentions qpp but could be ssp as well] additionally, we are pleased that telehealth is further integrated into reporting and beneficiary assignment requirements in the quality payment program. telehealth will be particularly effective in value-based care arrangements as it can produce better outcomes at lower costs. while this rule focuses on fee-for-service medicare, the ata looks forward to continuing to work with cms on transforming our system from one that rewards volume to one that rewards value, and we believe telehealth is an integral part of that effort.", "479": "2. if the web interface system is discontinued, delay the implementation of the proposed changes to aco quality reporting until 2022  our first preference would be to continue allowing acos to report quality through the web interface system for the reasons described above.  if cms chooses to discontinue web interface, we believe the timeline cms has proposed to shift quality reporting to an ecqm based methodology is too aggressive and cannot be reasonably met by organizations not already using ecqms in an advanced manner.  even the most sophisticated tins participating with pom aco today have not built the programming necessary in their emrs to successfully report ecqm data to cms nor to share it with pom aco. our smallest and least resourced tins may not even be reporting any ecqm data to cms and may be completely at the mercy of their emr vendor to make the programming changes necessary to be able to submit the required data to cms and/or to pom aco.  for every tin, the amount of time, energy and money necessary to modify its emr programming to meet these proposed requirements will be different. by the time the proposed rule would be finalized, tins and emr vendors would be far behind the timelines necessary to complete, test, and validate the programming necessary to successfully and confidently submit the necessary data to cms or to their acos.", "480": "3. allow aco-participating tins to individually submit all necessary data for all components of the alternative payment model performance pathway (app) and create an aco-wide score rather than require acos to aggregate data and report on behalf of all participating tins  throughout the proposed rule, cms seems to draw a distinction between reporting done by acos and reporting done by aco participants and aco providers. this leads us to conclude that cms expects acos to be aggregating data for reporting that has not typically been the responsibility of acos and, as we have described for quality reporting above, may not always be possible or practical.  while we strongly support cms aligning reporting requirements for payment programs, we do not support placing that reporting burden on acos. acos are often multi-tin groups with disparate emrs and widely variable capabilities. there is no clear benefit to the mssp\u2019s goals, or to patients, for acos to be aggregating this data for submission to cms. aco\u2019s resources are better spent on improving care, care coordination, and quality throughout their networks. these proposed data aggregation requirements do not support those efforts. on the contrary, the proposed requirements would hinder aco\u2019s care and quality improvement efforts by diverting scarce resources in order to meet reporting requirements.  cms is aggregating this data already, and could continue to aggregate the reporting done by acoparticipating tins in order to create aco-wide scores for each mips category. forcing acos to do this data aggregation is duplicative and costly.", "484": "the aan urges cms to carefully consider policies that can aid small and solo practices in being successful in the qpp, both during and after the phe. cms should also consider whether modifications to the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy are necessary regardless of practice size, if the impacts of the phe extend into 2021.", "498": "we thank cms for taking action to provide more flexibility to acos during the covid-19 pandemic. we strongly support the option provided to acos with agreements ending december 31, 2020, to extend their agreements for an additional performance year and appreciate the agency clarifying that this policy also applies to track 1+ acos. this will provide much needed stability for acos in an uncertain time.", "507": "we do not support cms proposal to change the policy to give acos that report the higher of their own score or the 40th percentile quality performance category score of all mips reporters or to give acos that do not report the 40th percentile score. we believe cms should maintain the existing policy of using the mean aco score in place of the 40th percentile score. acos have typically outperformed many other mips reporters and using the 40th percentile score for those acos that are affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance is likely to give acos a much lower score than they might have earned outside of those unique circumstances.", "508": "[not directly on this topic, but we thought it was important for dafda to review. we can recategorize if needed.] we urge cms to exclude mips bonuses as aco expenditures under the mssp shared savings and losses methodology. when aco-attributed patients receive services from providers that have earned positive mips adjustments, it decreases the aco\u2019s ability to generate savings. the effect of the current policy will become increasingly significant over time as mips adjustments rise in future program years. the current cms policy creates misalignment between the goals of mips and mssp. the better an aco and its eligible clinicians perform in mips, the more challenging it will become to earn shared savings under mssp. we strongly encourage cms to amend the current methodology to exclude these payment adjustments.", "509": "we support cms\u2019 proposed change to not require acos to administer the cahps for acos survey for py 2020 and to give all acos automatic full credit on all cahps measures. should the covid-19 pandemic extend for a significant portion of 2021, we recommend that cms consider applying this change to py 2021 as well.", "510": "we strongly support the alternative modification that cms is considering to give acos that report quality for py 2020, the higher of their py 2019 or py 2020 quality score. we believe this approach will encourage acos to report quality and do what they can to improve quality performance scores while also acknowledging the unique circumstances of the covid-19 pandemic and its likely effect on quality of care for reasons that are largely outside of an aco\u2019s ability to control. we recommend cms consider extending this approach to py 2021 as well (i.e., that acos receive the higher of their py 2021 or py 2019 score).", "513": "we do not support cms\u2019 proposal that acos that meet the quality performance standard would earn the maximum amount of shared savings. we believe there is value in encouraging improvement on quality measures beyond the minimum and that acos that perform better on quality should be rewarded with a higher savings percentage. we recommend that cms keep the existing policy for incorporating quality performance into earned shared savings calculations", "515": "to date, cms has not discussed digital health tools\u2019 key role in the success of apms which should have the flexibility to use connected health technologies for patients with specific at-risk chronic conditions. for example, the medicare shared savings program, by far medicare\u2019s largest apm, cms only waives patient location and geographic limitations on accountable care organizations (acos) that are at financial risk and use prospective assignment. there also haven\u2019t been case studies on acos\u2019 use of rpm. in order to help providers utilizing apms meet statutory requirements to reduce total costs, cms should exercise its statutory authority under 42 u.s.c. 1315a(d)(1) (in the case of cmmi models) and 42 u.s.c. 1395jjj(f) (in the case of the medicare shared savings program) to waive payment and program requirements as appropriate. specifically, cms should allow wider use of telehealth in the shared savings program by allowing all acos access to telehealth waivers and expand what telehealth waivers cover, for example, to include patient cost-sharing, modalities, and covered services.", "522": "asco supports the agency\u2019s proposals for flexibilities for acos including the application of the \u201cextreme and uncontrollable circumstances\u201d policy. for performance year 2020, all acos are considered affected by the public health emergency (phe) for the covid-19 pandemic, and the shared savings program extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy applies. in addition, for performance year 2020 only, cms is proposing to waive the requirement for acos to field a consumer assessment of healthcare providers and systems (cahps) for acos survey. consequently, acos would receive automatic full credit for the patient experience of care measures.", "528": "in addition, the acc requests more clarity on quality reporting for the next generation aco program which relies on the cms web interface. cms has extended this model for one additional year; the proposed rule does not indicate whether next generation aco participants would have to transition to a new reporting method for the final year of the program or if they will be permitted to use the web interface for one additional year. the acc requests that clarification be provided to model participants and noted in the final rule.", "531": "(unclear if ssp) i am writing to recommend that new quality measures be added to capture psychological distress engendered by covid-19. examples include screening for isolation and for anxiety (similar to what we do for depression currently). in addition, there need to be more relevant behavioral health measures overall.", "532": "cms needs to continue to pay for telehealth for a multitude of reasons foremost being improved access to care. telehealth allows patients to be seen when patients are unwilling or unable to get to the physicians office. patients often cancel due to transportation or weather concerns prior to covid restrictions. now many patients are afraid to leave their house and foregoing routine following care and at times acute care needs. telehealth visits also help with follow-up care. i can easily see my patients for simple routine care such as diabetes f/u or depression f/u via telehealth. this increases compliance with f/u and with better adherence to medication regimens by allowing more frequent discussion between patients and providers. i implore you to continue payments for this service."}
