It is not unusual for ACOs to be comprised of participants on disparate electronic health records. The Web Interface tool allows for seamless pairing clinical data from various sites. Elimination of this reporting mechanism in the short-term will create a reporting challenge for ACOs, and providers that comprise them, at an already dynamic time for healthcare organizations. If the goal remains to eliminate the Web- Interface mechanism, a prolonged phase-out will allow organizations to prepare.", "3": "...In addition, the move to a 4th decile ACO quality performance threshold could prove detrimental for organizations struggling in the readmission and unplanned admission for multiple chronic condition metrics. These vital measures of utilization practices are complex and require intensive shifts in practice patterns to gain measurable improvement.

ACO\u2019s are currently experiencing extreme stress due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and\nwe are very concerned about our ability to cope with so many drastic changes. We urge CMS to\npostpone making changes to the structure of the MSSP quality measurement program.\n\nACOs\u2019 have invested considerable resources into maintain high quality which is the cornerstone\nof Value Based Care. The purpose and aim of quality measurement must be to improve patient\ncare and not to fit a universal mold. ACOs\u2019 should never be assessed the same as other APMs\nand MIPs programs. CMS should further refine quality measures to enhance patient care. CMS\ncreated APMs with specific goals in mind and we strongly feel that quality measures must be\nindividually tailored for the needs of each APM.\n\nThe proposed approach lumps all APMs and MIPS providers into one basket. Historically ACOs\nhave paralleled Medicare Advantage Plans and ACO quality standards are very similar to the\nMedicare Advantage program. We are also opposed to ACO participants from selecting to report\noutside the ACO since allowing the same could distort the performance of the risk bearing ACO.\nWe urge CMS to continue the APM scoring standard at least until a proper ACO centric\nReplacement Methodology can be agreed upon by all concerned stakeholders", "5": "PBACO is in favor of reducing administrative burden however we have significant concerns that\nthe proposals, including limiting the number of performance based measures, puts ACOs at risk\ndue to the dependence on the stability of fewer measures. Over our seven years of program\nparticipation we have observed the MSSP make errors and subsequent corrections to ACO-11 in\nPY2016 and PY2017. Furthermore, we have noticed remarkable nuances in the adjustment \n3\nmethodology in our ACO CAHPS measures. We support broad measurement across many\nmeasures where ACOs are insulated by the affects of errors, adjustments or other anomalies that\ncan potentially erase an ACO quality performance score and ultimately their shared savings\nmultiplier and opportunity for annual revenue. We support that a larger set of quality measures\nsmooths such anomalies, reduces overall ACO risk and is worth any additional administrative\nburden.", "6": "CAHPS Survey: We do not support combining the survey into one measure due our experience\nthat certain measures can have anomalies including MSSP errors, unpredictable adjustments and\nor other unexpected outcomes.\n\nSimply put, any benefit from reduced administration is far offset by the increased risk of the\ndependence on the accuracy and statistical stability of a single measure set.\nAdditionally, ACO CAHPS cannot be compared to MIPS CAHPS. PBACO will have\napproximately 90,000 Patients during 2021 and require a sample system that truly reflect large\nACOs. The present system of 860 patients is too small a percentage of patients to predict the\nPatient satisfaction scores with a 95% confidence level. We propose increasing the PBACO\nsample size to 2,000 patients as opposed to the MIPS-CAHPS requirement of 60,000 patients\nwhich is impractical to administer and very expensive.", "7": "Present GPRO Measures: We strongly disagree with canceling the CMS Web Interface. It has\nbeen our experience that eCQM adoption at practices is less than 25%. PBACO has over 30\nEMR systems with various capabilities as well as a dedicated team of three ACO employees to\nfacility education, optimization and implementation of our provider EHR systems. Some EMRs\nare not ready to collect eCQMs intuitively and providers must go through convoluted workflows\nto report eCQMs. Secondly providers will have to report data from other payers, in addition to\nMedicare as many EHRs do not have the capability to report by payer. This distorts the ACO\u2019s\nMedicare specific quality performance reporting. It is our opinion that the various EHR\ncertification should refine and standardize workflows for eCQMs which have been tested in the\nfield and which do not increase administrative burden for providers. It is our observation that the\nrespective EHRs have various workflows for the same eCQMs and have not been pervasively\nimplemented. The gap to achieve effective and efficient implementation of eCQMs is still large\nand too large to justify the replacement of CMS Web Interface quality submissions.\n\nWe do not agree that the proposed three quality measures are adequate to measure provider\nperformance and to provide adequate insolation from the statistical risks of dependency on such\nfew measures. We do agree that the Domain score of 50% should not change with the proposed\nrule however we strongly recommend reinstating more and essential ACO measures. Please refer\nto TABLE 36P. We have added back a) Colorectal Cancer Screening, b) Breast Cancer\nScreening, Depression Screening and Follow-Up, Influenza immunization, and Pneumococcal\nvaccinations. These measures are the core measures in an ACOs quality performance. PBACO\nhas observed favorable outcomes from the training and implementation of Depression screening\nand Follow-Up. We would like to reintroduce Pneumococcal vaccinations as an important\nmeasure to reduce hospitalizations due to various forms of Pneumonia. Additionally, during\nCOVID-19 patients will have higher immunity levels to Pneumonia caused Bronchial infections.\nAlong with the reintroduction of these measures we request that the Domain score for measures\nrelated to the WI remain stay constant at 50%.", "8": "Claims Based Measures: We disagree with the proposed increased weight of the claims-based\nmeasures to 33% of the total score from 25%. We propose the reinstatement of Ambulatory\nSensitive Condition and maintain the total domain weight for Claims Based Measures at 25%.\nEssentially, we are proposing no change to these measures. We further caution CMS that the\nreduction of claims based measures and the increase in domain weight can have unintended\nconsequences and the introduction of risks to ACOs. Please consider the MSSP errors and\nsubsequent corrections to ACO-11 in PY2016 and PY2017. We believe that these errors set a\nprecedent that errors can happen and that broadly reduces an ACOs ability to smooth or defend\nitself from such errors. Considering that any given measure will have significantly more\nindividual significance, errors, like those that occurred in PY2016 or PY2017 have a much\nhigher chance of completely erasing an ACO quality performance score and ultimately their\nshared savings multiplier and their opportunity for annual revenue.", "9": "Removing the CMS Web Interface Reporting Mechanism \nIt took several years of education and technological investment for PBACO to effectively and\nefficiently report quality using the CMS Web Interface. Eliminating this option will drastically\nincrease PBACOs cost for quality reporting due to the various EMR vendors\u2019 eCQM annual\nregistry fees.\n\nWe also have significant concerns regarding the lack of uniformity and ability to be compared to\npeers with the way eCQMs are collected today. Today\u2019s EMRs report eCQMs for all\nbeneficiaries including ACO and non-ACO beneficiaries and Medicare and non-Medicare\nbeneficiaries. We believe that this is a significant programmatic downside where current\nperformance is Medicare, incentive and demographic specific. In additional to the introduction of\npotentially irrelevant performance measurement, the variety and inconsistency of demographics\nby provider may potentially distort the performance measurement and the ability to accurately\ncompare providers. It is possible that our payer specific Data Use Agreements do not cover all\ndemographics and we may run into legal conflicts with Insurance companies. PBACO is in favor\nof less administrative burden but requests that CMS continues to pursue other options including\nmore widespread adoption of the CMS Web Interface. It is our proposal that CMS continues to\nrun eCQMs in parallel with the CMS Web Interface and monitors the results.\nCurrently, PBACO is reporting quality for 2,792 patients. Under the proposed rule we will be\nforced to report quality on 60,000 ACO patients across dozens of disparate systems at a\nsignificant financial expense.\n\nACO Quality must be Targeted to ACOs and their ACO peers and cannot be compared to\nproviders with disparate value based contract implementation, payor mix or demographic mix.", "10": "PBACO opposes the removal of Pay-for-Reporting when new measures are introduced. ACOs\nneed time to educate on, build and implement workflows for new quality measures. We urge\nCMS to not finalize this approach and instead maintain the pay-for-reporting for the first year\nintroduced to ACOs in their initial performance year, as well as new quality measures when they\nare introduced or significantly changed.\nPBACO urges CMS to utilize a scoring approach that is more like the current domain-based\nscoring approach instead of using an all-or-nothing approach as proposed. We do not see the\ncorrelation of value delivered by ACO providers and the way that they are scored with an all-ornothing approach. We find it difficult to state that a 20th percentile performer receives 0 points\nor delivers 0 value while a 30th percentile performer receives 1.2 points or 55% of the value. We\nbelieve that further promoting this all-or-nothing approach will unjustly disconnect the\ncorrelation from the value that Medicare beneficiaries and the Medicare Trust Fund receive from\nstatus performance of ACOs and discourage providers from participation. One side effect of\nincreased ACO participation is improved performance in ACO quality measures and the increase\nof the performance thresholds for percentile scoring. The all-or-nothing proposal of the 40th\npercentile required threshold allows that \u201cgood\u201d performance of previous years may be classified\nas 0 performance in future years. We expect that this is an enormous risk to the sustainability\nand the perceived fairness of the program by providers.

We\nthink there is value to Medicare Shared Savings program for ACOs with upside only risk. There are privately\npracticing physicians who are committed to actively engage in the Shared Savings Program work to innovate\nand improve healthcare processes, but either cannot afford to personally take on risk, or because the margins\nare small in the ACO financials, even a small amount of risk to too much for them to bear. We have physicians\nraising grave concerns about being required to take on risk. As you are aware, physician lead ACOs historically\noutperform hospital lead ACOs. Upside only ACOs generate Shared Savings. We are aware Medicare wants to\npush all ACO to high risk, because the current high risk ACOs tends to generate greater degree of Savings. At\nthis point, high risk ACOs are self-selected. If all ACOs were forced into high risk, Medicare cannot ensure the\nsame degree of savings will occur. A steady amount of shavings generated by upside only ACOs brings value\nto the Medicare system, continues to drive improvements and is potentially more sustainable long term. Does\nMedicare want short term gains or long term gains? Personally, we think it is better to have steady long term\nbenefits for the program.", "18": "Change from domain based approach to an all or nothing approach - We disagree with these\nchanges and request Medicare continue with the domain based approach. These changes are\nsubstantial. Why does Medicare want to make it more difficult for ACOs to attain shared\nsavings? From my personal perspective, this is counter intuitive. Shared Savings is the carrot\nto make change happen. The threshold for receiving a percentage of savings should be\nreasonably obtainable. Physician lead ACOs utilize a significant amount of the shared savings\nto drive innovation, care coordination and to support the practices to drive improvement.\nMaking the threshold too high will make the program no longer financially feasible for the\nphysicians to participate.\nIf physician lead ACOs consolidates with large entities to manage the ACOs, then Medicare will\nsuffer from the natural outcome of large consolidation, which is standardization.\nStandardization reduces the amount of innovation that occurs and we will have another\nversion of the Medicare Advantage system.\nA different thought on encouraging change is to have a step process for quality measures and\npercentage of savings which can be done for upside only ACOs. Example: ACOs can choose to\ngo with the current 23 measures for up to 50% of the shares savings of which they will receive\nsavings based on their overall quality score. The alternative is to move to the proposed 6\nmeasures report through the web interface and have the opportunity for 70% of shared\nsavings, because moving to a limited measure set of outcome based measures has greater risk\nand challenges.", "19": "Quality Performance Standard: We request to keep the minimum quality achievement at 30%\nper measure not 40%. Some measures are very challenging and the ACO has limited control of\nall of the various healthcare delivery components to the measure, such as all cause\nreadmissions and unplanned admissions. For example, it has taken us several years to have\nthe local hospitals provide the ACO access to the discharge lists for our patients. Since it can\ntake time to build and educate on why working with the ACO is of value, we request Medicare\nto maintain the current minimum of 30%. \n\nA second example to take into consideration, our ACO suffered a substantial decline in\nmammography rates, because a regional mobile mammography provider went out of business.\nThis was a major provider of mammography services for our ACO patients and is no longer\navailable for our region. They were the only provider. Now we have substantial issues with\ntransportation to obtain mammography screening. Issues like this are unpredictable and if\nflexibility is removed from the system, the ACO could suffer significantly.\nA third example is when ACOs take on new physician practices. Even when new practices have\nexperience in working with quality measures and risk, the ACO environment is different than\nthe Medicare Advantage experience and does not translate to success. The ACO environment\nhas a different process and cadence that must be taught. If an ACO takes on too many new\npractices, this can create a significant challenge in improving quality measures year over year.\nACOs need time to adapt and find new solutions for unpredictable events and taking on new\nphysician practices.

The other component, we\nneed to know the benchmarks for the 6 proposed measures. Will CMS take into consideration\npatient compliance? Some patients take longer to archive care goals, while some patients\nnever will. How will CMS accommodate for these patients for whom the physician is doing\ntheir best to assist the patient, yet the patient is unable or unwilling to archive measure goals?\nIn addition, is CMS taking into account the ACO patient mix with the 6 identified quality\nmeasures? Do the ACOs have the same relative volume of diabetes and hypertension? If not,\nhow will this be addressed?

CMS also notes that many ACOs are high\nperformers under the current structure and the agency believes it is appropriate to require a\nhigher standard of care in order for ACOs to continue to share in any savings they achieve. CMS\nalso notes the agency believes holding ACOs to a higher standard is in line with CMS goals of\nincentivizing value-based care and driving the Medicare system to greater value and quality.\nNotably, the new APP would include fewer measures and a higher minimum attainment\nstandard, which is the threshold that ACOs would be evaluated on to be eligible to share in\nsavings earned.\n\nWhile CommonSpirit supports the concept of streamlining and focusing quality measure sets,\nwe are not confident that the proposed measure set best suited to advancing the MSSP\u2019s\ngoals.

The AHA does not support the removal of the\nweb interface reporting option for ACOs at this time. The web interface has been\nused by ACOs since the MSSP\u2019s inception to report data on non-claims based\nmeasures used in the program. The web interface collects data on Medicare\nbeneficiaries participating in the MSSP, and has a set of data collection and attribution\napproaches associated with it. However, CMS proposes to eliminate it because its use\noutside of the MSSP program is limited, and the agency is seeking to bring the MSSP\nquality measurement approach into closer alignment with the MIPS.\nWhile we appreciate the potential benefits of greater alignment between programs,\nthere are profound differences between how data are submitted in the \u201cregular\u201d MIPS\nprogram and how they are reported by ACOs using the web interface. In the first place,\nthe data collection types that would now be available to ACOs \u2013 EHRs, qualified\nregistries and qualified clinical data registries \u2013 all require data to be collected on an allpayer basis, and not simply on Medicare beneficiaries. For a program that is called the\nMedicare Shared Savings Program, and is intended to improve the care for Medicare\nbeneficiaries, we question the appropriateness of including all-payer data.\nFurthermore, allowing the use of multiple different reporting options in the MSSP could\nhave significant impacts on measure benchmarks. There are differences in the measure\nspecifications among each of these reporting mechanisms; it is possible, even when\nreporting on the same measure title, to receive different scores. For that reason, when\nCMS calculates performance benchmarks in the MIPS program, it creates separate\nbenchmarks for each data collection type. Yet, CMS does not address in this rule how it\nintends to reconcile any potential performance differences among ACOs that may stem\nfrom differences in data collection types.\nUnless and until CMS can address the two issues above, it is not appropriate to remove\nthe web interface reporting option.

However,\nCMS proposes to require ACOs to achieve the 40th percentile of performance as\ncompared to all MIPS quality category scores, as opposed to only ACO scores.

The AHA opposes CMS\u2019s proposal to eliminate\npay-for-reporting for first year of MSSP participation, as well as pay-for-reporting \nfor newly added or significantly revised measures.

Pay-for-reporting periods give ACOs the opportunity to ramp up their\nmeasurement and improvement capabilities in a sustainable fashion before their shared\nsavings or losses are tied to quality performance.", "51": "Changes to the Medicare Shared Savings Program\nCMS proposes significant changes to the MSSP quality reporting requirements and quality measurement\nmethodology. These changes include applying the Medicare Incentive Payment System (MIPS) Alternative\nPayment Model (APM) Performance Pathway (APP) to the MSSP to align the quality reporting between\nthe MIPS Quality Payment Program (QPP) and MSSP. In addition, CMS would eliminate the Web Interface\nreporting option for ACOs and increase the quality performance standard required for ACOs to be eligible\nto share savings to the 40th percentile or above across all MIPS quality performance categories. CMS\nestimates that these changes will result in a reduced number of ACOs meeting the quality threshold for\nshared savings.\nGNYHA opposes these changes. While we support CMS\u2019s goal of reducing the reporting burden and\naligning reporting requirements across the MSSP and MIPS QPP, the specific proposals actually will\nincrease provider burden.

Our detailed comments on each of the proposals follow.", "52": "Transition to the APP and Removal of Web Interface Reporting Option\nGNYHA opposes the transition of MSSP quality reporting to the APP. While this proposal would reduce\nthe burden on ACOs in terms of the overall number of measures required for submission, it would impose\nnew burdens because CMS would discontinue the Web Interface reporting option. Instead, ACOs would be\nrequired to report quality information through one of the allowable methods under the APM APP, either\nthrough a registry or direct submission via electronic health records (EHRs).\nACOs have invested significantly in developing processes to allow for the submission of quality data.\nSwitching to either of the APP reporting options would require significant investments in workflow\nchanges, new infrastructure such as registries, and/or adaptation of EHRs to comply with electronic clinical\nquality measure standards. Not only would this impose significant financial and operational burdens on\nACOs, the required operational changes could not be completed by the start of the 2021 performance year.\nAs with all health care providers, ACOs are currently struggling with numerous challenges and significant\nuncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It would be irresponsible to implement such a drastic change\nat this time.\nFurthermore, the quality submission options proposed by CMS do not allow for quality reporting and\nmeasurement specific to only ACO attributed beneficiaries. Therefore, ACOs would be assessed for quality\nperformance on non-ACO assigned beneficiaries. GNYHA believes that ACO quality performance should\nbe limited, to the extent possible, to the defined cohort of beneficiaries that are assigned to the ACO.\nTherefore, to avoid placing unnecessary burden on providers and to ensure that quality measurement\nreflects the true performance of each ACO, GNYHA recommends that CMS withdraw its proposal\nto remove the Web Interface reporting option.", "53": "Revision of the Quality Performance Standard\nCMS proposes to raise the quality performance standard (the minimum threshold for an ACO to be eligible\nfor shared savings) from the 30th percentile for at least one measure in each domain to requiring a MIPS \nquality performance score at or above the 40th percentile across all MIPS categories. This change makes it\nmore difficult for ACOs to earn shared savings. As mentioned above, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused\nsignificant uncertainty among ACOs. While we applaud CMS for its efforts to address the potential impact\non the various pay-for-performance programs for 2020, we believe such a major change to the MSSP quality\nperformance standard is premature. The long-term impact of COVID-19 on Medicare beneficiaries and\nultimately its impact on quality measurement is still unclear. For example, CMS\u2019s proposed rule impact\nanalysis is based on 2018 data and therefore may not be representative of average quality performance post\nCOVID-19. We urge CMS to postpone these changes until both CMS and the provider community\nhave been able to assess the impact of the pandemic on quality scores.", "54": "Medicare Shared Savings Program\nCMS Proposals\nCMS proposes to revise the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) quality performance standard\nto align with a proposed Alternative Payment Model Performance Pathway (APP) under the Quality \nPayment Program Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS).

While the agency\u2019s proposal would\nreduce the amount of reporting required of an ACO, it also would require ACOs to quickly pivot from\nestablished quality measurement and reporting processes, even as many of them are still in the midst\nof responding to the pandemic.

In contrast,\nelimination of the Web Interface would require us to quickly transition to reporting via a different\nmechanism. Further, we would need time to understand the differences in measures specifications\nbetween the Web Interface and our chosen reporting mechanism, and identify and adjust to any\npotential impact on performance.

CMS proposes a smaller measure set, a decrease from 23 measures to six,\nincluding two hospital admissions and readmissions measures:\n\uf0b7 Hospital-Wide, 30-day, All-Cause Unplanned Readmission (HWR) Rate for MIPS\nEligible Clinician Groups\n\uf0b7 Risk Standardized, All-Cause Unplanned Admissions for Multiple Chronic Conditions for\nACOs\n\nRecommendation:\nBCBSA opposes the inclusion of these two hospital admissions and readmissions measures in\nthe proposed measure set. We urge CMS to align the proposed measure set with the Core\nQuality Measures Collaborative (CQMC) and its work on the Accountable Care\nOrganization/Patient-Centered Medical Home (ACO/PCMH) measure set.\n\nRationale:\nBCBSA supports CMS\u2019 alignment with the CQMC ACO/PCMH core measure set aiming to:\nidentify high-value, high-impact, evidence-based measures; align measures across public and\nprivate payers; and reduce the burden of measurement by eliminating low-value metrics,\nredundancies and inconsistencies in measure specifications and quality measure reporting\nrequirements across payers.\n\nCQMC membership includes CMS, health insurance providers, medical associations, consumer\ngroups, purchasers (including employer group representatives) and other quality collaboratives\nworking together to recommend core sets of measures by clinical area to assess the quality of\nAmerican health care.\n\nBCBSA is a voting member in the CQMC and recently voted in opposition to including the\nHospital-Wide, 30-day, All-Cause Unplanned Readmission (HWR) Rate for MIPS Eligible\nClinician Groups measure in the ACO/PCMH measure set. BCBSA instead voted in support of\nNCQA\u2019s Plan All-Cause Readmission (PCR) measure. Health plans use the PCR measure\nmore widely as it is an NCQA accreditation requirement. Additionally, discussion with the CQMC\nworkgroup included identification that the PCR measure is more robust and broader than the\nHWR measure. For example, the PCR measure includes patients 18 and older while the HWR\nmeasure only includes patients 65 and older.\n\nThe Risk Standardized, All-Cause Unplanned Admissions for Multiple Chronic Conditions for\nACOs measure was not reviewed by the CQMC ACO/PCMH workgroup. CQMC members can\nbring measures forward for review, yet this measure was not identified for review with the \nworkgroup by any of the members.

These changes are significant and touch every aspect of quality improvement efforts from reporting quality data, tracking measure performance, and how ACOs are evaluated and scored for both the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) and Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). The changes come at a very challenging time, when our ACO and the health care industry as a whole continue to navigate the great uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 global health pandemic. We urge CMS to not finalize these proposals and continue to work with ACOs to adapt the quality measurement and assessment process. There are multiple concerns with the proposed ACO quality changes. First, replacing the current domain-based quality scoring approach with an all or nothing standard is a significant change that will have a big impact on ACO performance. Secondly, drastically reducing the number of quality measures from 23 to six de-emphasizes quality and will create a performance standard that may not be truly representative of an ACO's actual quality improvement efforts. Thirdly, abruptly removing the Web Interface as a reporting mechanism will have a big impact on ACOs' ability to get credit for their true quality efforts. CMS should continue to offer the Web Interface as an option and over time allow additional reporting options to those ACOs who would be ready to implement, such as registry or Electronic Health Record (EHR) reporting. Additionally, moving to the alternative reporting options CMS has provided through the proposed APM Performance Pathway (APP) would cause many ACOs to have to pay for registries and/or EHR upgrades and dashboards to capture the correct data to be able to report to CMS. Finally, there are remaining questions regarding how the ACO would report the data for non-Medicare and non-ACO patient data, which is required when reporting using a registry or EHR. This could cause ACOs to have to revisit contracts and could raise legal concerns as the ACO does not typically have access to non-ACO patient data. Finally, we also have deep concerns with CMS's proposal to remove the pay-for-reporting year currently provided to first time ACOs as well as quality measures that are newly introduced or undergo significant changes. ACOs use the pay-for-reporting year as a time to get the correct processes and performance dashboards in place to be able to be successful in their quality improvement efforts. These are critical and removing them while still holding ACOs accountable for new quality measures, as an example, is unfair and will cause ACOs to hesitate to enter the program. ACOs are committed to providing high quality care to our patients and quality improvement is at the core of what we do. Making these sweeping changes at this challenging time will disadvantage my ACO and we urge CMS to not finalize these proposed ACO quality policies.

Comment on Shared Savings Program Quality Performance Standard\nCMS proposes to increase the level of quality performance that would be required for all ACOs\nto meet the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) quality performance standard to the\n40th percentile or above across all MIPS Quality performance category scores. The previous\nstandard was achieving the 30th percentile on one measure in each domain.\nAdditionally, the proposal includes a provision applicable to 2021 and subsequent performance\nyears specifying that ACOs must submit quality data via the APP to satisfactorily report on\nbehalf of the eligible clinicians who bill under the TIN of an ACO participant for purposes of the\nMIPS Quality performance category.\nCMS proposes that to qualify for shared savings, an ACO must meet the minimum savings rate\nrequirements established for the track/level, meet the proposed quality performance standard\ndescribed in the proposed rule, and otherwise maintain its eligibility to participate in the SPP.\nFor performance years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, if an ACO that is otherwise\neligible to share in savings meets the proposed quality performance standard, the ACO will\nshare in savings at the maximum sharing rate according to the applicable financial model (up to\nthe performance payment limit). If the ACO fails to meet the proposed quality performance\nstandard, the ACO would be ineligible to share in savings.\nRecommendation:\nWe do not support changing the quality measure minimum threshold from the 30th to 40th\npercentile. Achieving shared savings is very difficult work. The 30th percentile is currently\ndifficult to achieve for some measures due to small numbers and tight benchmarks. An ACO could have a high quality score and score below the 40th percentile on just one measure, and\nthe way CMS has written the proposed change, having one measure below the 40th percentile\ncould make the ACO ineligible for shared savings.\nFor the 2019 performances year, our ACO had an overall quality score of 96%; we also scored a\n40th percentile or lower on 2 of the 23 measures. If this proposed change was in place for the\n2019 performance year, our ACO would have been ineligible for shared savings, even with a\nsignificantly high score. The current corrective action plan is the appropriate next step when an\nACO does not score well in quality. We do not support a penalty of losing all shared savings\nopportunities for a year where quality performance does not meet the minimum attainment, as\nNGACOs already take on a high amount of risk.", "61": "I. Comment on Quality and Reporting Requirements\nCMS proposes to revise the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) quality performance\nstandard effective for performance year 2021 and subsequent performance years. According to\nCMS, the new APP would streamline reporting requirements for MSSP ACOs and would create a\ncomplementary path to the MIPS Value Pathways. Under this proposal, the number of\nmeasures ACOs would be scored on would decrease from 23 to 6, and the number of measures\non which ACOs would be required to actively report would be reduced from 10 to 3. ACOs\nwould only need to report one set of quality metrics that would satisfy the reporting\nrequirements under both MIPS and the MSSP. The four categories in the proposed APP \nOur mission is to improve health and well-being in partnership with our members, patients and community.\nframework would be weighted as follows: Quality: 50%; Promoting Interoperability: 30%;\nImprovement Activities: 20%; and Cost: 0%.\nRecommendation:\nOur organization includes providers who participates in the MIPS program and the Next\nGeneration ACO model. The Next Generation ACO model follows the same rules as the MSSP\nACOs. As a Next Generation ACO, we appreciate that Medicare is proposing to reduce the\nnumber of quality measures for ACOs. This would reduce the reporting burden and allow ACOs\nto focus on a select number of quality measures. A lower number of measures also means that\nthere is more weight placed on only a few quality measures.\nWe have reviewed the proposed quality measures and agree with continuing to report on the\nproposed Preventive Health and At Risk Population measures. However, we would request\nmore information on the CAHPS measures such as will the current 2019/2020 CAHPS measures\ncontinue in 2021? HealthPartnersthrough its Park Nicollet ACO has participated in CMMI ACO\nrisk programs since 2012 and because of the subjective nature of the survey our overall patient\nexperience domain score has varied significantly through the years. We believe part of this\ncould be that the survey is lengthy, and not all of the questions apply to all of the patients,\ncausing a low response rate to some of the questions that can skew the results. Only 861 of our\noverall ACO patients (~15,000) receive this survey and less than 400 of our patients usually\ncomplete the survey. The number of patients responding creates a challenge. It is difficult to\nimplement changes to address all survey topics for all patients as well as rely on the patient to\nrecall what was recently discussed. We are also concerned about the number of surveys that\nour patients receive as it is our organizations current practice to send all patients a short\nexperience survey after each visit at HealthPartners.\n\nHealthPartners agrees that Patient Experience is an important part of the triple aim to evaluate\nand would like to continue including these measures in quality reporting, however we are\nconcerned that reducing the number of overall measures puts disproportionate weight on the\nCAHPS for ACO survey results for all the reasons noted above; we are not fully confident that\nthe results of the survey reflect our ACO patients experience.\n\nThe proposed 2021 quality measures also include 2 claims measures from the Care\nCoordination/Patient Safety domain. Our ACO would also like to provide feedback on these 2\nmeasures as 2 of the 6 proposed measures. We have found that we have also had a lot of\nvariation for our results related to the Risk Standardized 30-Day Readmissions measure.\nHealthPartners has found that the benchmarks for the claims based measures are very tight.\nOur numerator and denominator are relatively small, which means that if a few additional\npatients are admitted or readmitted (depending on the measure) our results can easily swing\nfrom passing to failing. We would suggest evaluating how the benchmarks are set for the\nclaims-based measures.....", "62": "III. Comment on Proposal to Remove ACO overlap patients from QP denominator\nIn the Proposed Rule, CMS specifies that beneficiaries who are prospectively attributed to an\nAPM entity will be excluded from the attribution-eligible beneficiary count for any other APM\nentity, when that beneficiary would be ineligible to be added to the other APM entity\u2019s\nattributed beneficiary list. That is, CMS would remove prospectively aligned beneficiaries from\nthe denominator when calculating the thresholds. The Preamble to the Proposed Rule states\nthat \u201cthe effect of this proposed policy would be to remove such prospectively attributed\nbeneficiaries from the denominators when calculating Threshold Scores for APM entities or\nindividual eligible clinicians in Advanced APMs that align beneficiaries retrospectively, thereby\npreventing dilution of the Threshold Score for the APM Entity or individual eligible clinician in\nan advanced APM that uses retrospective attribution.\u201d\nRecommendation:\nOur ACO agrees that the ACO overlap patients could be removed from the QP denominator.\nHealthPartners/Park Nicollet Accountable Care Organization LLC is a part of an ACO Coalition\nwhich has submitted feedback regarding freezing the QP thresholds in 2021 instead of\nincreasing these thresholds. We did not see this addressed in the proposed and so we are\nincluding our feedback letter on this topic.", "63": "IV. Proposal to Modify the CAHPS for MIPS Quality Reporting\nCMS notes that the MSSP extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy applies for the CY\n2020 performance period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result CMS proposes to waive\nthe requirement to field the CAHPS survey and will grant all ACOs full credit for the CAHPS\nmeasures.\nRecommendation:\nWe ask that for performance year 2020, the requirement for ACOs to administer/report CAHPS has been\nwaived, and will receive full credit for CAHPS reporting. Recommend to apply the same waiver to MIPS\ngroups that elected to administer/report CAHPS, to create alignment amongst the programs.\nAlso, it\u2019s noted the ACOs 2021 CAHPS measures will count as one score. Recommend that all domains\nbe scored as have historically, since there may only be 5 additional measures reported for ACOs.\nMeasuring all domains will then will continue the alignment between the ACO and MIPS programs.", "64": "VII. Sunset of the Web Interface\nCMS proposes to eliminate the web interface reporting option starting with the CY 2021\nreporting period. This option was previously available to groups and virtual groups of 25\nclinicians or more. CMS indicates that the use of the web interface has declined significantly\nover the past two performance periods. Furthermore, CMS proposes to eliminate the\nrequirement for MSSP participants to report quality measure data via the web interface, and\nthe vast majority of web interface users were in the MSSP. We describe the MSSP quality\nreporting changes elsewhere in this advisory. Lastly, CMS notes that the web interface\nrequirements were significantly more stringent than the other MIPS reporting options, and that\nnine out of the 10 measures included in the web interface would remain available in the MIPS\nusing one of the other MIPS reporting options.\nRecommendation:\nRetiring the Web Interface at this time would create an undue hardship and financial burden on\npractices, as currently still operating in COVID-19 pandemic state. It also reduces flexibility in reporting\nas to what works well for one practice versus another. The consensus among industry analysts is that\nmost electronic health records have not been able to keep up with the changing requirements of the\nMIPS program, and that QCDRs are not able to report all categories of the program. It would be\ndetrimental that CMS provides a list of all MVP measures/specifications to all electronic medical record\nvendors and QCDRs early on, so that all EMRs and QCDRs have the ability to report in a timely manner.\nThe administrative burden associated with moving to a new reporting mechanism involves allocating\nstaffing resources to redesign care process and work flows, at the potential expense of the overall care\nexperience for patients in order to meet the reporting requirements. Also, it states on page 50279 of\nthe rule, that the traditional MIPS option will continue to be available for 2021. Therefore, we\nrecommend that the Web Interface remain a reporting option in 2021 to allow practices time to convert\nto a new reporting mechanism, with the ability to test out the new reporting mechanism alongside the\nweb interface. This would allow groups to continue submissions as have historically and would ease\nreporting burden during a national pandemic.\nSome of the reporting options offered, such as eCQMs and MIPS CQMs, require all payer data be\nsubmitted. This is a significant change from reporting Medicare FFS only through the Web Interface, as\nthe denominator has been greatly increased, and creates unknown risk in how a practice may score\nunder the new reporting method. Therefore, we again recommend that groups be allowed to report\ntwo ways for 2021 \u2013 through the Web Interface and another option chosen. This is not much different\nthan what CMS allows today, reporting the category components through different reporting options\nand keeping the highest score across sources.", "65": "Sunsetting the Web Interface Submission Method\nCMS proposes to sunset the Web Interface as a method for submitting data for the quality performance\ncategory starting in the 2021 reporting year for MSSP ACO, MIPS, and APM Participants. We agree that focusing\nprogram requirements on sophisticated and automated quality reporting methods like eCQMs and aligning on a\nsingle reporting method across reporting programs will reduce burden.\nOrganizations that currently rely on the Web Interface (including most MSSP ACOs) will be better prepared to\nreport via eCQMs if they have adequate time to transition. Rather than retire the Web Interface for the 2021\nreporting year, we recommend that CMS instead provide at least one transition year and retire the Web Interface\nin the 2022 or 2023 reporting year for the reasons outlined below.\nTechnical Guidance Required\nBefore retiring the Web Interface, CMS needs to provide technical guidance for ACOs and health IT developers\ndetailing how ACOs will implement eCQM reporting for the ACO attributed patient population. The MSSP model\nis designed to hold organizations accountable for the cost and quality of care for the specific patient population\nattributed to the ACO, so quality measures are currently reported only for patients who are attributed to the\nACO. The current quality reporting model of eCQMs focuses on clinician and TIN performance in meeting quality\nstandards for their entire patient population. Because of this scope, the current QRDA I or QRDA III\nimplementation guides adopted by certified health IT modules for reporting in other programs do not provide a\nway for MSSP ACOs to report quality data solely for ACO-attributed patients.\nAlso, current QRDA III implementations summarize data at the TIN or NPI/TIN level, rather than at the ACO level.\nCMS will need to create an updated QRDA III implementation guide to account for reporting at the ACO level.\nCMS should publish a draft implementation guide and allow health IT developers to review it and provide\nfeedback. CMS should also create new or update its existing testing tools so health IT developers can validate new file output. Developers will need time to code, test, and roll out these updated reporting tools to healthcare\norganizations after CMS has published final technical guidance and updated tools.\nEffective identification of patients enrolled in the ACO within the EHR will be essential for successful reporting\nusing eCQMs. CMS must continue to provide roster files and patient enrollment data with robust demographics\ndata for patient matching including name, date of birth, sex, the patient\u2019s full address, phone number, and\nMedicare Beneficiary Number. Without sufficient enrollment data from CMS, organizations will not be able to\neffectively match patients attributed to the ACO within the EHR, unable to monitor and act on health trends\nacross the enrolled population, and ultimately unable to report accurate quality data using eCQMs.\nProvider Burden\nRetiring the Web Interface for the 2021 reporting year would also add burden to provider organizations who will\nneed to implement new workflows to ensure discrete capture of data required to calculate eCQMs on short\ntimelines, since Web Interface measures relied on data manually abstracted from patient charts and did not\nrequire discrete data capture. Provider organizations will need to train their clinicians on those new workflows\nand program requirements, update processes for data validation, and train staff in their quality department on\nthose updated processes. Compounding the burden is the fact that changes to clinician workflows and training\nmust be complete by 1/1/2021 since organizations are required to report on a full year of quality data.\nIn its proposed rule, CMS indicates plans to publish a final 2021 PFS Rule 30 days before its implementation date\nof January 1, 2021, which is insufficient for the scope of this proposed change, especially considering competing\ninitiatives ....", "66": "Modifications to the Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Policy for PY 2020\nProposal: CMS is seeking comment on an alternative quality scoring approach for ACOs under\nthe extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy.

The FAH requests that CMS be explicit if they intend to make any changes\nin the survey methodology with this proposal. Shifting the survey size requirement to be based\non TINs rather than ACOs will result in substantial financial burden to ACOs.", "76": "Multiple Chronic Condition (MCC) Admissions\nThe FAH does not support inclusion of the MCC Admissions measure in MSSP due to limited\ninformation on how the measure performs and the lack of endorsement by the National\nQuality Forum (NQF). CMS must ensure that the data produced yields scores that more\naccurately and consistently represent the quality of care provided by an ACO. As such, the FAH\nrecommends that CMS increase the minimum sample size to produce a minimum reliability\nthreshold of sufficient magnitude (e.g., 0.7 or higher) in light of the reliability range from 0.12 to\n1.00 using data from the 2018 performance year. The FAH does not believe that face validity is\nsufficient to demonstrate that the measure as attributed provides appropriate and evidence-based\nrepresentations of the care provided by these clinicians. We strongly encourage CMS to validate\nthese measures through additional testing, such as predictive and construct validity, to ensure\nthat application of the measure to ACOs is appropriate and yields scores that are valid and\nuseful. We also ask that the measure be reviewed and endorsed by the NQF prior to its\nfinalization for MSSP.", "77": "Days at Home\nThe FAH cautions CMS on the development and potential implementation of a measure that\nexamines the rate of days at home for Medicare beneficiaries. This type of measure could be\nconsidered the inverse of many of the measures currently included within MSSP, such as the\nHospital-Wide, 30-day, All- Cause Unplanned Readmission (HWR) Rate for MIPS Eligible\nClinician Groups and the proposed Risk Standardized, All-Cause Unplanned Admissions for\nMultiple Chronic Conditions for ACOs. Because this new measure would present the opposite\nviewpoint of the time spent in health care facilities, it could be viewed as a form of double\ncounting. As such, the FAH encourages CMS to reassess the set of measures used for MSSP if\nand when this measure is ever proposed.\nThe FAH believes that the recent work by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission\n(MedPAC) and the Harvard School of Public health to explore the usefulness of a Healthy Days\nat Home measure underscores several of the challenges associated with this potential measure.8\nFor example, the time that individuals aged 65 years of age and older spent at home ranged from\n343.1 to 353.9 days during a 12-month period. While the days at home were slightly lower for\nthose with two or more chronic conditions (minimum: 334.0 and maximum: 348.7) and those\nwith three or more chronic conditions (minimum: 327.5 and maximum: 344.5), these ranges\ndemonstrate minimal variation across 306 markets. The analysis of the number of markets that\nperformed better or worse than the national mean is also useful in understanding the degree to\nwhich differences in performance across ACOs could be meaningfully distinguished. Across all\nMedicare beneficiaries in the sample, their time at home was just under six days, and the best\nwas 5 days greater than the national mean. Those beneficiaries with more complex health needs\n(3 or more chronic conditions) receiving care in the worst performing market spent 9 days less at\nhome and just under 8 days more in the best performing markets. The researchers also found that\nthere were several socioeconomic factors that would be significantly associated with healthy\ndays at home including but not limited to, median income, percentage below the poverty line,\nphysician and primary care physician density, and acute care hospital beds per 1,000 residents.\nThese findings indicate that this type of measure may not provide sufficient variation to enable\nassessments of which ACOs are better or worse performers and will likely require inclusion of\nsocial risk factors within any risk adjustment.\nThe FAH encourages CMS to carefully consider whether the measure produces results that\nare reliable and valid and enables groups to distinguish differences in performance in a\nmeaningful way. The measure must also be first reviewed and endorsed by the NQF prior to\nits proposal in rulemaking.", "78": "Modifications to Quality Reporting Requirements on the Extreme and Uncontrollable\nCircumstances Policy for Performance Year 2020\nThe intent of the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy is to mitigate any negative\nimpact of such a circumstance on an accountable care organization\u2019s (ACO\u2019s) quality\nperformance or ability to report quality data to CMS and the resultant effect on financial\nreconciliation due to emergency circumstances outside of the ACO's control. In recognition of\nthe many ACOs that find themselves operating under extreme and uncontrollable circumstances\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS is proposing a change to this policy to encourage quality\nreporting for performance year 2020.\nRather than assigning the higher of an ACO's own 2020 quality score or the 2020 mean ACO\nperformance score under the current extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy, CMS\nproposes an alternative that would apply the higher of an ACO's 2020 quality performance score\nor its 2019 quality performance score for ACOs that completely report quality data for 2020.\n8 Burke, Laura & Orav, E. & Zheng, Jie & Jha, Ashish.

However,\nthose who are not able to fully report should not be penalized. As acknowledged by CMS, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has raised novel issues for patients and providers.

Specifically, CMS would\nrequire ACOs in the MSSP to report quality data via the newly proposed APP. Under\nthis new approach, ACOs would report a smaller set (six versus 23) of quality metrics\nthat would satisfy the reporting requirements under both MIPS and the MSSP. We urge\nCMS to be thoughtful in its approach for adoption of the APP, and other drastic\nchanges to the MSSP, at a time when ACOs are faced with ongoing concerns related to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. \na. CMS should further engage stakeholders before implementing the APP for\nACOs participating in the MSSP, and the agency should seek feedback on the\nAPP measure set to ensure reliability and fairness and prevent unintended\nconsequences.\nWe understand CMS\u2019 desire to align the MSSP quality performance standard with the\nproposed APP under the QPP, such that participants in the MSSP also would report\nquality via the APP. While we support greater alignment and reduced burden,\nintroducing a new pathway such as the APP requires careful consideration.\nCMS notes the APP was designed for all MIPS APMs. However, the agency believes the\nAPP measure set also would be appropriate for ACOs participating in the MSSP. The\nAPP contains a narrower measure set than previously used in MSSP quality\nmeasurement\u2014six measures versus the current 23 scored measures. The six measures\nare related to patient experience, diabetes, depression screening, blood pressure control,\nall-cause unplanned readmissions, and all-cause unplanned admissions for multiple\nchronic conditions.\nWe applaud CMS\u2019 intent to move the quality measure set used in the MSSP toward\nmore outcome-based, primary care measures. However, we do not feel the current\nproposed APP measure set achieves this goal. As quality reporting programs focus more on\noutcomes and move away from process measures, CMS must ensure that measures\nchosen for these programs accurately reflect quality of care and account for factors\nbeyond a hospital\u2019s control. The agency should ensure the measure set includes metrics that\nare valid and reliable; aligned with other existing measures; and risk adjusted for\nsociodemographic factors. CMS should not include measures in ACO quality\nperformance standards until they have been appropriately risk adjusted for\nsociodemographic factors, including socioeconomic status. Without appropriate risk\nadjustment for outcomes measures, such as the proposed readmission measure, the\nAPP measure set could disproportionately impact the performance of essential\nhospitals.\nWe urge CMS to take time to gather more stakeholder input, such as through a request for\ninformation and listening sessions. Further, CMS should seek endorsement by organizations\nwith measurement expertise, such as the National Quality Forum (NQF) and its Measure\nApplications Partnership (MAP). Through NQF processes, measures are fully vetted and\napproved through a consensus-building approach that involves the public and\ninterested stakeholders. Measures should undergo review and obtain NQF endorsement\nbefore inclusion in the APP", "80": "CMS should not remove the pay-for-reporting year for MSSP ACOs.\nCurrently, in the first year of an ACO\u2019s first agreement period, all measures are scored as\npay-for-reporting, meaning ACOs must completely and accurately report all quality\ndata used to calculate and assess their quality performance. In the second and third year\nof the first agreement period and all years of subsequent agreement periods, measures\nare scored as pay-for-performance. \n\nCMS notes that under its proposal to require that ACOs report quality via the APP,\nthere would be \u201cno quality \u2018phase in.\u2019\u201d In other words, all ACOs, regardless of\nperformance year and agreement period, would be scored on all measures in the APP\nfor purposes of the MSSP quality performance standard.

The\nremaining reporting methods include MIPS clinical quality measures (CQMs) and\neCQMs. We appreciate options for ACOs to report quality measures. However\nremoving the Web Interface and pivoting quickly to an alternative reporting method\nwill require time and resources to change workflows, pay for registries, and adapt EHRs\nto comply with eCQMs.\nAs noted, CMS also would sunset the Web Interface as a collection type for groups and\nvirtual groups with 25 or more eligible clinicians, starting with the 2021 MIPS\nperformance period. For clinicians in groups who previously used Web Interface as a\ncollection type, CMS assumes these groups would use the other two collection types\n(MIPS CQMs and eCQMs) available in the 2021 MIPS performance period.

Since its inception, our ACO has been working to improve the quality of care for our patients as well as to ensure our patient\u2019s care is better coordinated. Therefore, we believe CMS should consider retaining the following measures from the Preventive Health Domain: \u2022 Quality ID#: 112 Breast Cancer Screening \u2022 Quality ID#: 113 Colorectal Cancer Screening \u2022 Quality ID#: 110 Preventive Care and Screening: Influenza Immunization We recognize that this would increase the number of measures an ACO would report in the 2021 performance year from 3 to 6 measures, but we feel these are important quality measures for our Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, the influenza vaccination measure for the 2021 performance year is of particular importance for this upcoming season in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nSince our inception in 2015, our ACO has invested significant time and resources (e.g. staff, tools), and a made changes to our workflows in our EHR to accurately reflect our quality performance using the Web interface reporting option. We were surprised that in the proposed rule CMS plans to remove the Web interface reporting option. We strongly believe that the Web Interface reporting mechanism should still be considered an option to report quality in 2021 and onwards.

ACOs should not be ineligible to share in savings if they do\nnot meet the more stringent quality performance standard.\nCurrently, an ACO needs to achieve the 30th percentile on at least one measure in each domain to meet the minimum quality standard and be eligible for shared savings. We believe this requirement is achievable since the benchmarks are released early enough during the performance year, helping an ACO set goals throughout the year. In addition, there are enough measures in each domain to allow ACOs to meet the 30th percentile in at least one measure per domain. We believe that the proposal to increase the minimum threshold from the 30th to the 40th percentile sets too high of a bar, especially if the 2021 benchmarks are not being released until after the 2021 performance year and the number of measures is reduce to six for 2021.

Page 11 of 12 The proposed rule would replace the current MIPS APM Scoring Standard, which allows each APM to have its own set of unique quality measures and scoring approaches that best fit the particular model. The current approach allows specific APMs to have meaningful quality measures tailored to their model\u2019s goals while still providing credit for quality improvement efforts to those who are also subject to MIPS. The proposed APP approach would instead apply one set of quality measures for all APMs subject to MIPS. Therefore, each model participant would need to report not only their APM\u2019s specific quality measures, but the APP quality measures as well. This one size fits all approach results in more burden for APM participants and further may require the model participants to report on measures that are not applicable or appropriate. Moreover, given the proposed delay in the implementation of MVP, we are unclear why this proposal should be rushed to implementation. The MSSP ACOs have used the Web Interface since the beginning of the program and will need time to create a new workflow. We instead urge CMS to maintain the APM Scoring Standard. CMS also proposes significant changes to the quality measure set ACOs must report under the new APP. The total number of ACO quality measures would be reduced from 23 to 6, and the number of measures for which ACOs are required to submit data would be reduced from 10 to 3. Generally speaking we support a reduction in measures to reduce reporting burden. However, we are concerned the proposal goes too far and may not sufficiently capture ACO performance. We urge CMS to gather additional stakeholder input before finalizing a revised set. In particular, from the Measure Applications Partnership (MAP) that is intended to advise on the appropriateness of measures in Medicare, and the Core Quality Measure Collaborative (CQMC) on which CMS partners with AHIP that is intended to facilitate the alignment of measures across public and private payers. CMS should seek additional stakeholder feedback before making such significant changes to the measure set and within the context of whether its finalizes the APM Scoring Standard policy.", "92": "CMS proposes that ACOs would need to achieve at least a 40th percentile quality performance score across all categories to share in savings or avoid owing maximum losses. CMS proposes that it could terminate participation agreements with ACOs that fail to meet the quality performance standard for two consecutive years or three non-consecutive years, out of a five-year contract. We are concerned about increasing the minimum quality performance score to the 40th percentile and CMS establishing a policy to terminate participation agreements with ACOs that fail to meet the quality performance standard at this time. While we appreciate and support ensuring the ACOs meet a minimum level of quality and increasing that minimum over time, the current pandemic calls for a pause in any increases in expectations. As CMS notes, 99.6 percent of ACOs participating in the Page 12 of 12 program in 2018 met the 30th percentile showing that a small minority of ACOs struggle in this area and would benefit from technical assistance rather than being dropped from the program. These ACOs have committed to pursuing higher quality outcomes and have every incentive to do so. If they are dropped from the program, the providers and suppliers that comprise them will have less motivation to invest time and resources to achieve such outcomes. Moreover, as measures become topped out or change unexpectedly due to the pandemic, failure to meet a threshold may reflect more about the scoring system itself or exigent forces than the actual quality of patient care. Thus, we do not, at this time, support increasing the minimum quality threshold or removing ACOs from the MSSP program for failing to achieve it.", "93": "For CY2021, CMS proposes to reduce provider burden, align measures across programs, and address high priority areas for quality improvement by implementing APM Performance Pathway (APP) for MIPS APMs for MSSP Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) for the 2021 performance year.

Additionally, CMS is proposing to simplify the reporting requirements by reducing the number of reported measures from 23 measures to six, and the number of actively reportable measures from ten to three. The proposed implementation date for the APP is January 1, 2021. Centene supports efforts to streamline quality measurement and reporting. However, we caution against any massive program changes that may create more complications for ACOs.

Centene remains concerned that the proposed increase would be a drastic adjustment from the current score and would not allow ACOs enough time to make onerous process and system changes. For ACOs that serve chronic and complex care populations, the quality performance standard is already difficult to meet. Raising that standard would cause a significant burden on all ACOs and unjustly penalize those ACOs providing care for complex patient populations. Given these concerns, we ask that CMS avoid finalizing this proposal and instead retain the MSSP quality performance score at the 30th percentile.", "95": "CMS also proposes that an ACO\u2019s participation agreement will be terminated when the ACO fails to meet the quality performance standard for two consecutive performance years within an agreement period or fails to meet the quality performance standard for any three non-consecutive performance years within an agreement period.

Further, these sweeping changes would be implemented during a COVID-19 Public Health Emergency and are tied to a final rule that will be released in December 2020, which will leave ACOs only one month to transition to the new reporting method.\nFrom a broad perspective, Ochsner believes that ACOs should not be evaluated and assessed in the same manner as all other APMs or individual MIPS clinicians who are not participating in total cost of care and full accountability payment models. It is also unclear how CMS determined that the APP measures are more appropriate the current APM quality measures. The proposed one size fits all approach does not take into consideration the spectrum and variability between MIPS APM programs where each APM has specific goals and objectives or create a set of measures that better inform patients. For example, it does not make clinical sense for the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced, or BPCI-A, to be compared and measured on the same set of measures that apply to the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) participants. Quality measurement with APM programs should focus on measures most appropriate for the individual program and hold health care providers and organizations accountable for the quality and cost of care.\nOchsner recommends that CMS postpone making any structural changes to how ACO quality is assessed and reported until at least 2022 or 2023 and work with stakeholders to develop the best balanced, fair and technically sound quality measures. In the meantime, we urge CMS to maintain the current APM Scoring Standard approach. While the proposed revision to ACO quality measures may reduce administrative burden, they significantly alter and narrow the lens through which quality is assessed. The proposed six APP measures are a drastic reduction from the 23 measures currently used to assess ACOs. We believe the proposal goes too far by reducing the number of clinical quality measures to only three measures focused on controlling diabetes and high blood pressure and screening for depression. We recommend that CMS retain several important preventative care quality measures that are a strength of the current set of quality measures and have been proven to improve patient outcomes, including: ACO-14, Influenza Immunization; ACO-19,\nColorectal Cancer Screening; ACO 20, Breast Cancer Screening; and, the previously used Pneumonia Vaccination measure.\nWe also have significant concerns that two of the six quality measures are focused on All-Cause Unplanned Hospital Admissions and Readmissions. The unplanned readmissions measure has a very narrow band where there is less that a 1 percent difference between the 30th percentile and the 90th percentile for the 2020 benchmark targets for ACO-8, Risk Standardized, All Condition Readmission. As a result, small differences in readmissions can result in drastic differences in quality scores that are not meaningful or an accurate reflection of an ACO's quality improvement efforts. Further, since the ACO program already provides direct financial incentives to reduce avoidable hospital admissions and readmissions, we do not believe it is appropriate to have onethird of the total measure set linked to these utilization measures. In response, Ochsner recommends that CMS postpone any significant changes in ACO quality measures until 2022 or 2023 and utilize the interim period to consult with the ACO community and patient representatives to determine the most appropriate set of measures that will lead to meaningful improvements in the quality of care.", "97": "Ochsner opposes this all-or nothing approach to shared savings, particularly surrounding the use of the proposed hospital readmissions measure with an extremely narrow bands in performance percentiles. Instead, should CMS move forward with its redesigned quality assessment structure for ACOs, we recommend that CMS use a scoring method similar to the current domain-based scoring approach. For example, CMS could instead consider a policy that would use a minimum attainment requiring 50 percent of the quality measures to meet or exceed the 40th percentile, which must also be done in concert with our recommendations to add additional clinical quality measures to the measure set currently proposed by CMS. Setting the standard at 50 percent ensures that ACOs perform well on a substantial set of measures to earn shared savings but does not punish ACOs that may fall below the performance threshold on a measure that is not as relevant to their patient population or has a very narrow range of performance percentiles, such as the proposed hospital readmissions measure.", "98": "The proposed Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) quality measures are the right\nmeasures; however, the percentile scoring system creates too narrow a range and\nheightens disparities in health care - an alternative is needed;\n\u25cf 2021 is not the right time to change MSSP reporting methods as the new method would\nrequire implementation in January 2021, not February 2022 when the report is due;", "99": "Family Health Center supports the policy change that CMS describes, which would ensure that when FQHC clinicians participating in accountable care organizations (ACOs) furnish primary care services to individuals in skilled nursing facilities (CPT codes 99304-99318), those services would be excluded for purposes of beneficiary assignment to an ACO. As we understand, this ensures parity between FQHC practitioners and physicians and practitioners who practice in other settings with respect to this issue. We therefore support CMS' proposed implementing amendment at 42 C.F.R. S", "100": "Under the proposed revisions to the quality reporting requirements, CMS will no longer generate a CMS\nWeb Interface quality reporting sample for ACOs because ACOs will no longer be reporting measures via\nthe Web Interface; therefore, they propose to determine the percentage of the ACO\u2019s performance year\nassigned beneficiary population that was affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstances\nbased on the quarter four list of assigned beneficiaries, rather than the list of assigned beneficiaries\nused to generate the Web Interface quality reporting sample, which is currently used. CMS believes that\nusing the quarter four list of assigned beneficiaries is an appropriate alternative because the file is\ngenerated after the end of the fourth quarter and would offer a more complete representation of the\npopulation of assigned beneficiaries that reside in an area that is impacted by an extreme and\nuncontrollable circumstance during the performance year. CMS seeks comment on these proposed\nrevisions to the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy for performance year 2021 and\nsubsequent performance years. Providence St. Joseph urges CMS to postpone this change at least one\nadditional year to 2022. For some of hospitals that have not built electronic clinical quality measures\nto report quality measures this will be a challenge. Electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs) are a\npart of the CEHRT standard but organizations are not required to use them since there are different\noptions to report. Building the eCQMs is a large body of work and would take time to validate.

The changes come at a very challenging time, when our ACO and the health care industry as a whole continue to navigate the great uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 global health pandemic. We urge CMS to not finalize these proposals and continue to work with ACOs to adapt the quality measurement and assessment process. There are multiple concerns with the proposed ACO quality changes. First, replacing the current domain-based quality scoring approach with an all or nothing standard is a significant change that will have a big impact on ACO performance. Secondly, drastically reducing the number of quality measures from 23 to six de-emphasizes quality and will create a performance standard that may not be truly representative of an ACO's actual quality improvement efforts. Thirdly, abruptly removing the Web Interface as a reporting mechanism will have a big impact on ACOs' ability to get credit for their true quality efforts.

This could e ACOs to have to revisit contracts and could raise legal concerns as the ACO does not typically have access to non-ACO patient data. Finally, we also have deep concerns with CMS's proposal to remove the pay-for-reporting year currently provided to first time ACOs as well as quality measures that are newly introduced or undergo significant changes. ACOs use the pay-for-reporting year as a time to get the correct processes and performance dashboards in place to be able to be successful in their quality improvement efforts. These are critical and removing them while still holding ACOs accountable for new quality measures, as an example, is unfair and will cause ACOs to hesitate to enter the program.

However, these changes would require significant time\nand resources to implement during a time in which providers are still actively responding to the\ncoronavirus pandemic. We request that CMS delay significant changes to the MSSP quality\nstandard until 2022....\n\nElimination of the GPRO Web Interface\nCMS proposes to retire the CMS Web Interface in concert with its proposal to revise the MSSP quality\nperformance standard. ACOs would be required to report electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs)\nvia EHR or MIPS CQMs via a qualified registry or Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR). Premier has\nlong advocated for ACOs to be able to use reporting mechanisms beyond the Web Interface. The\nWeb Interface is time consuming and labor intensive to gather the data. Additionally, the once-yearly data\ncollection doesn\u2019t allow for continuous tracking and quality improvement. We applaud CMS for\nrecognizing ACOs\u2019 need for flexibility. We believe using other reporting mechanisms will allow CMS to\nevolve the MSSP quality measure set and incorporate measures that can be assessed over multiple\nyears and novel measures, such as patient reported outcomes.\nWe ask that CMS provide a transition period away from the Web Interface to allow clinicians to\nadapt or implement new systems. ACOs use a variety of technology and infrastructure approaches for\ncombining clinical data across the ACO. It is critically important to understand that ACOs vary widely in\ntheir electronic data extraction and reporting capabilities, with some ACOs on a single EHR instance and\nothers with dozens or even hundreds of different source systems. This reflects ACOs varying approaches\nto adding participant practices to the ACO that include a range from employment to alignment. For the\nACOs with multiple source systems, producing MIPS CQM or eCQMs from those disparate systems, if\neven possible, would be prohibitively expensive and would require a third-party vendor to merge the data\nfrom each system. Current CEHRT standards include a requirement for eCQM support. However, this is\nfocused solely on calculating eCQMs for and from each CEHRT instance and does not require support of\ncombining data from multiple systems to produce a single result.\nRecognizing the diversity of ACOs, we appreciate options for ACOs to report quality measures. However,\nmaking the switch to these alternative reporting options will cost many ACOs considerable time, money\nand effort in changing workflows, paying for registries and adapting, and modifying Electronic Health\nRecords to report eCQMs in a way that is not currently required of CEHRT. Accordingly, we request\nthat CMS provide more time for ACOs to adapt to new reporting options. While some ACOs may be\nready to adopt new reporting mechanisms now, others need at least one additional year to implement a\nnew reporting method.\nWe believe additional time is also needed for CMS to clarify how new reporting options will apply to ACO\nmeasurement. There are several areas related to moving to eCQM or registry reporting that are not\naddressed in the proposed rule:\nBenchmarks. In MIPS, benchmarks vary by reporting mechanism. With ACOs being able to report\nthrough two separate reporting mechanisms, CMS must clarify how benchmarks will be set for\nMSSP ACOs. If CMS will continue to separate benchmarks by reporting mechanism, CMS must\nensure ACOs are not penalized by their choice of reporting mechanism.\n\u2022 Population Assessed. In MIPS, clinicians are assessed on total population, not just Medicare\nbeneficiaries.

ACOs that meet the quality performance standard\nwould share in savings at the maximum sharing rate. The current approach is to multiply the quality score\nby the maximum sharing rate. We support raising the quality performance threshold and allowing\nACOs that meet the standard to receive full shared savings, provided that this change accompanies a\nsmaller program measure set and the standard is assessed as an average of the measures.\nWe would not support a 40th percentile standard applied to each measure given our concerns about\nseveral of the measures", "105": "Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Changes\nFor performance year 2021, CMS proposes to change the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances\napproach to align with the proposed quality changes.

Premier supports the\nproposed additions, as well as the permanent addition of G2010 and G2012, to the MSSP primary\ncare services decision beginning with performance year 2021. Virtual check-ins (G2012) and remote\nevaluation of patient video/images (G2010) are communications-based technology services that have\nproved their value across the disease spectrum and care continuum and will continue to have a place\nafter the PHE ends.\nCMS also proposes to revise the existing primary care service exclusion for professional services billed\nunder CPT codes 99304 through 99318 that are furnished in a SNF to include services reported on a\nclaim originating in an FQHC or RHC.

The Next Generation ACO model follows the same rules as the MSSP ACOs. As a Next Generation ACO, we appreciate that Medicare is proposing to reduce the number of quality measures for ACOs. This would reduce the reporting burden and allow ACOs to focus on a select number of quality measures. A lower number of measures also means that there is more weight placed on only a few quality measures.\nWe have reviewed the proposed quality measures and agree with the continuing to report on the proposed Preventive Health and At Risk Population measures. However, we would request more information on the CAHPS measures such as will the current 2019/2020 CAHPS measures continue in 2021? One MHA member has participated in CMMI ACO risk programs since 2012 and because of the subjective nature of the survey our overall patient experience domain score has varied significantly through the years.\nPatient experience is an important part of the triple aim to evaluate and should be included in these measures, however there is concern that reducing the number of overall measures puts disproportionate weight on the CAHPS for ACO survey results.\nThe proposed 2021 quality measures also include 2 claims measures from the Care Coordination/Patient Safety domain. An MHA member ACO would also like to provide feedback on these 2 measures as 2 of the 6 proposed measures. This member has found that there is a lot of variation for their results related to the Risk Standardized 30-Day Readmissions measure. Benchmarks for the claims based measures are very tight. Numerators and denominators are relatively small, which means that if a few additional patients are admitted or readmitted (depending on the measure), results can easily swing from passing to failing. We would suggest evaluating how the benchmarks are set for the claims-based measures. We would also like the readmissions benchmark to be evaluated considering the CMS Hospital Readmission Penalty Program has determined to remove at least Q1 and Q2 2020 readmissions from their performance data. Additionally, we would like more information on if adjustments will be made for the ACO Readmission data, both exclusions and benchmarking impact.\nThe measure Risk Standardized All- Cause Admissions for Patients with Chronic Conditions is also very challenging to address and track during the year. The same MHA member ACO as above reports that it has tried to create a proxy measure to track how we are performing on this measure, however they have not been able to do that for the following reasons. There are a total of 8 conditions in this measure and the patient has to have at least 2 of the 8 to be in the numerator. They have not been able to duplicate the same risk-adjustment methodology to compare their results to how they would be measured. Their ACO has multiple interventions in place to address the needs of patients with chronic conditions, however their results for this measure do not always reflect this. We would suggest evaluating how the benchmarks are set for the claims-based measures. We would also suggest considering adding additional measures that reflect our work with preventive health.", "110": "MHA and its members do not support changing the quality measure minimum threshold from the 30th to 40th percentile. Achieving shared savings is very difficult work. The 30th percentile is currently difficult to achieve for some measures due to small numbers and tight benchmarks.

The PHE continues to divert\nresources for such activities at the present time.\nMayo appreciates the efforts to reduce reporting burden, offer more flexibility in the way quality data can be\nreported and the creation of a more meaningful measure set that focuses on population health measures. In\nthe final rule, Mayo seeks clarity on electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs) and the applicability to the\nentire patient population. Under the new APM Performance Pathway (APP), ACOs would be assessed on a\nsmaller measure set. The proposed three measures as outlined in the eCQM measures specifications reflect\nthe entire population across multiple payers and age groups since they are included in the denominator.\n\u2022 Quality ID#: 001: Diabetes: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Poor Control (>9 percent);\n\u2022 Quality ID#: 134 Preventive Care and Screening: Screening for Depression and Follow-Up\n\u2022 Quality ID#: 236 Controlling High Blood Pressure\nACOs should be allowed to choose quality measures that are applicable to the ACO beneficiaries. Specifically,\nMayo requests flexibility to select three measures that are a better representation of the ACO patient\npopulation who primarily have long-term, primary-care rather than those patients seen only in the destination\nmedical center. Measures must be meaningful and scored on the ACO attributed beneficiates and not the\ntotal population. Currently measure logic places the patient in the denominator regardless of provider specialty designation. If\nCMS were to move forward with this proposal, Mayo requests the agency incorporate logic into the measures\nthat requires a qualifying visit with a PCP. Additionally, the agency could modify requirements so as not to\ninclude non-ACO patients in the reporting under the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP). The\ndenominator for ACO quality metrics should include only the ACO\u2019s patient population. This change is\nespecially impactful for ACOs that include an Academic Medical Center (AMC) and often care for patients who\nhave primary care providers in other states. As an AMC where patients are seen for short term destination\nservices, reporting on the entire population may negatively impact ACO performance scores.\nIn terms of the APP scoring, Mayo asks CMS to clarify the requirement that an ACO must achieve the minimum\nthreshold (i.e., 40th percentile) on all quality measures to remain eligible for shared savings. As stated in the\nproposed rule, all ACOs, regardless of performance year and agreement period, would be scored on all the\nmeasures in the APP for purposes of the MSSP quality performance standard. This could have implications on\nquality scores if CMS implements the APP as proposed, because moving from 10 web interface quality\nmeasures to three quality measures will have substantial impact on performance. Although the statute\nrequires CMS increase the quality performance standard over time, changing the quality performance\nstandard on one measure in each domain to a requirement that ACOs achieve a quality performance score\nequivalent to the 40th percentile or above across all MIPS quality performance category scores will\nsignificantly impact ACO performance scores not allowing the ACOs to share in shared savings earned.

The proposed APP would replace the current Shared Savings program quality measure set to simplify reporting requirements. The new APP framework would also be weighted different, with quality accounting for 50 percent, PI accounting for 30 percent, IA accounting for 20 percent, and cost accounting for 0 percent. ACOs would be scored on the measures they choose to report but would receive zero points for those they do not report. Further, CMS proposes to remove the phase in approach for quality reporting. Regardless of performance year and agreement period, all ACOs would be scored on the same 3 actively reportable quality measures: 1) Diabetes: Hemoglobin A1C Poor Control (>9%); 2) Preventive Care and Screening: Screening for Depression and Follow-Up Plan; and 3) Controlling High Blood Pressure. While we appreciate the more streamlined measures for quality reporting and decreasing the total number, 2 of the 3 measures (A1c and controlling high blood pressure) are not appropriate for this patient population. Current measures in the MSSP, as well as other Medicare programs and models, are not clinically appropriate or applicable to a frail, seriously ill, and home-limited patient population (i.e., those treated by home care medicine practices). We are concerned that even though physicians are delivering high-touch, high-quality, and clinically appropriate care to this medically complex patient population, they are penalized under these programs due to the quality measures. Additionally, this deters others from participating in the program. Thus, we urge CMS to adopt a more clinically appropriate measure set that is inclusive of complex, chronic care patients. We recommend 2 replacement measures from the Home Based Primary and Palliative Care Data Registry: 1) Telephone Contact, Virtual, or In-person Visit Within 48 Hours of Hospital Discharge of Home-Based Primary Care and Palliative Care Patients, and 2) Medication Reconciliation within 2 Weeks of Hospital Discharge of Home-Based Primary Care and Palliative Care Patients. Additionally, we request that CMS review the following publication that identifies large gaps in which home visits are not included in meaningful measures: To What Extent Are the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2019 MIPS Quality Measures Inclusive of Home-Based Medical Care?

While the Academy recognizes that a trade-off exists between setting an appropriate quality standard and the use of suitable measures, we do not support raising the overall quality performance standard. Given the chronic and complex care population we serve, our providers already find it difficult to meet the current 30th percentile requirement. Many quality measures are not appropriate for our patient population and raising the standard would unjustly penalize those ACOs providing care to the tail end of patient population. HBPC physicians participating in ACOs often care for the most-sick patients in the system with multiple chronic conditions that would otherwise be bound to long-term institutional care settings.", "128": "CMS is proposing to include certain codes for technical changes to the definition of primary care starting January 1, 2021.

CMS defines online digital evaluation, or e-visits, to be non-face-to-face, patient-initiated communications using online patient portals. The chronic disease management code requires two or more chronic conditions that place the patient at a significant risk of death or co-morbidities. Other requirements are applied to the following new codes: non-complex chronic care management, principal care management, and psychiatric collaborative care management. We are supportive of this proposal to update the definition of primary care services. We support the inclusion of the HCPCS code G2010 (virtual communication) as well.", "129": "CMS proposes to apply a proposed APM Payment Pathway (APP) to ACO clinicians beginning with performance year 2021 as a successor to the APM scoring standard, noting that CMS is proposing termination of the CMS Web Interface elsewhere in the proposed rule. The APP measure set consists of only six measures, chosen to focus on population health and care delivered through APMs and aligns with Medicare\u2019s program-wide Meaningful Measurement initiative. For performance year 2021 and thereafter, CMS proposes to also add the following policies on applying the APP to Shared Savings Programs as the ACO quality standard: \u25cf ACOs must report quality data via the APP; \u25cf CMS retains the right to audit and validate quality data reported by an ACO; and \u25cf Meeting the quality performance standard is required to be eligible to receive shared savings; minimum attainment would be set at the 40th percentile using MIPS benchmarks. We echo many of the comments and concerns raised by the National Association of Accountable Care Organizations (NAACOS) regarding CMS\u2019s proposals related to the MSSP. In particular, we echo the concerns raised with respect to CMS\u2019s overall approach proposed for ACO quality scoring. With changes to MIPS anticipated through the MIPS Value Pathways (MVPs) and exemptions due to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances -- such as for COVID-19 -- the 40th percentile of the Quality Category score could vary greatly from year to year, making it a less meaningful indicator of true performance. Instead, should CMS move forward with proposals to re-design the quality assessment structure for ACOs, we urge CMS to utilize a scoring approach that is more similar to the current domain-based approach. We also encourage CMS to better reward high quality performers, as is done in the Medicare Advantage program by providing bonuses or higher shared savings rates to high quality performers or those that notably improve quality scores over time. Finally, we note that the proposed changes would require significant time and resources to implement and, if finalized as proposed, would occur during a time in which we are still navigating the COVID-19 PHE and its consequences.

CMS notes that it considered adding HCPCS code G2010 (remote evaluation of patient video/images) and G2012 (virtual check in). CMS decided these codes are applicable during the PHE, but that outside the context of the PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic it expects that these monitoring/check-in services for established patients will no longer replace primary care services. CMS seeks comment on whether to permanently include HCPCS codes G2010 and G2012 in the definition of primary care services used in assignment.", "133": "CMS proposes to establish two policies that would allow certain ACOs to benefit from a lower repayment mechanism amount than would otherwise be required under the current regulations. The first policy would apply prospectively to any renewing ACO that uses an existing repayment mechanism to establish its ability to repay any shared losses incurred for performance years in its new agreement Page 19 period. The second policy would permit certain ACOs whose agreement periods began July 1, 2019 or January 1, 2020 to elect to reduce the amount of their repayment mechanisms. We appreciate CMS\u2019s ongoing efforts to minimize burdens associated with the repayment mechanism. We support both of CMS\u2019s repayment proposals and encourage the agency to finalize them as proposed. At the same time, we also encourage the agency to take additional steps to further reduce the burdens associated with repayment mechanism requirements. Many ACOs cite the burden and cost of securing a repayment mechanism as primary barriers against moving to a risk-based ACO model. To eliminate third party transactional fees that detract from investments in patient care, we urge CMS to remove the repayment mechanism requirement when an ACO can demonstrate that it has an investor or financial backer with a high credit rating. Financial backers could include outside investors, insurers, or hospitals or health systems that are aligned with the ACO and committed to providing financial support should losses occur. This flexibility would protect ACOs\u2019 finances, as well as the federal fisc, and eliminate the need for a 24-month tail period, which is an additional burden on ACOs. At the very least, if CMS continues to require a repayment mechanism, we encourage the agency to minimize associated regulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for a tail period, which is increasingly important in light of longer agreement periods.", "134": "AAHPM appreciates CMS\u2019 interest in developing a reporting mechanism for MIPS APM participants that would reduce reporting burden and encourage continued APM participation under its proposed APM Performance Pathway (APP), as well as in streamlining reporting requirements for participants under the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP). However, we believe CMS missed an important opportunity to encourage appropriate care for patients by failing to propose measure #47, Advance Care Plan, in the APP quality measure set. As noted above, advance care planning services are essential to ensuring high-quality care for Medicare beneficiaries, particularly those with serious illness or at the end of life. These discussions enable care teams to understand patients\u2019 values and goals in order to guide decisions about care and treatment. Studies show that advance care planning also leads to higher patient and family satisfaction with quality of care, less hospitalization, less intensity of treatment near end of life, more hospice use, and a higher likelihood of patients dying in their preferred place, as well as less stress, anxiety, and depression in surviving caregivers. For these reasons, we believe that CMS should hold MSSP and MIPS APM participants accountable for performance on the Advance Care Plan measure under the APP. We note that this would align with actions CMS has taken for other models, where it has recognized the importance of advance care planning services in several models currently underway. For example, the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced model assesses participant performance on this measure across all clinical episodes. Likewise, the Medicare Advantage Value-Based Insurance Design (MA VBID) model also requires all participating Medicare Advantage organizations to develop and implement a strategy regarding the delivery of timely AAHPM CMS-1734-P October 5, 2020 11 Wellness and Health Care Planning (WHP) services, including advance care planning services, to all enrollees. Otherwise, we note that it is difficult for AAHPM to assess CMS\u2019 APP proposal given the lack of information on participation in MIPS APMs and Advanced APMs by specialty. AAHPM strongly encourages CMS to increase transparency regarding the extent of specialty participation in each MIPS APM and Advanced APM by including data on specialty-level participation in such models in the annual QPP Experience Report or through annual rulemaking.", "135": "We strongly support CMS\u2019 stated goals to reduce burden and encourage APM participation. However, we are concerned that as described in the proposed rule, the APP will not achieve either goal. Below we describe our concerns in more detail, and make suggestions for how the APP can better support burden reduction and increased APM participation. Proposal to sunset the CMS Web Interface We have used the CMS Web Interface (or equivalent reporting method) since the 2011 Physician Quality Reporting System program. Over the past decade, we have devoted a substantial amount of time and resources into building tools and expertise required to complete the reporting each year. We have also refined our workflows and quality improvement strategies around what is needed for this reporting method. As proposed, we would need to find a new reporting method and renew our focus on a limited set of measures over a time period of just one or two months. While we are confident in our ability to shift to new reporting methods, the transition will take time. It will take a significant amount of time to build new workflows and reports. It will also take time to train clinicians on the new workflows and utilize the new reports to drive improvement in scores. To be clear, the improvement in scores will have more to do with documentation than with the actual quality of care. Because we have focused less on eCQMs and more on quality of care, there are still cases where a provider might not have the right field completely filled in to satisfy an eCQM. This could apply to a measure like Depression Screening and Follow-up, for example, where we currently have the flexibility to use unstructured documentation from the Progress Note rather than relying completely on a check box. For these reasons, our PY 2021 quality score will be negatively impacted if the CMS Web Interface is retired after the CY 2020 reporting period. Having an unrealistic timeframe to adjust to a new reporting method will certainly lead to inaccurate reporting on quality performance, thereby punishing our clinicians for appearing to provide poorer quality care when in fact we were simply not allowed sufficient time to transition to a new reporting method. We understand that CMS aims to make burden reduction a priority. A significant source of burden is the whiplash created by making major changes to programs with little time for clinicians to plan and adjust. We implore CMS to delay the retirement of the CMS Web Interface by at least one more year to the 2022 reporting period. With a change as momentous as this, our organization will need at least 12 months to adequately prepare so that our reported quality measures can meaningfully represent the quality of care we deliver.", "136": "Proposal to replace current SSP Quality Measure Set with APP Quality Measure Set We support CMS\u2019 efforts to develop quality measure sets that reduce clinician burden and avoid low value measures. However, we have concerns about the APP measure set. First, preventive care is a central mission of SSP ACOs and we are concerned that exclusion of foundational preventive care measures such as ACO-19 (Colorectal Cancer Screening) and ACO- 20 (Breast Cancer Screening) removes an important mechanism for accurately evaluating the impact of SSP ACOs on population health. Second, we are concerned that one third of the measures under the APP are related to utilization (Hospital-Wide, 30-Day, All-Cause Unplanned Readmission (HWR) Rate for the MIPS Eligible Clinician Groups and All-Cause Unplanned Admissions for Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC)). Such a heavy emphasis on utilization in the APP quality set is unnecessary given the direct financial incentive to control utilization in the SSP, and also given that the measurement of quality performance would be better served through preventive care measures as described above. Additionally, the HWR and MCC measures have tight performance distributions. As a result, small differences in quality that may be due to natural statistical variation rather than care delivery can have disproportionate impacts on program performance, resulting in quality scores that do not accurately reflect SSP ACO quality.", "137": "Changes to quality thresholds We support CMS\u2019 aim to drive improvements in the quality of care furnished by ACOs, and we generally support raising quality performance thresholds over time. We support the proposal for ACOs who completely report and are at or above the 40th percentile to receive the full maximum savings rate. We believe this supports CMS\u2019 stated goal of encouraging APM participation, and will act as a quality improvement incentive. If the proposal to raise the minimum attainment level from the 30th percentile to the 40th percentile is finalized, we recommend applying this as an average of all measures rather than to each measure individually. This is important both because of the concerns with the APP quality measures described above, and because the all-or-nothing approach proposed will create circumstances in which ACOs fail to share in savings through natural statistical variation rather than true poor performance. For example, an ACO in the 39th percentile on one quality measure but in the 95th percentile on all others may be locked out of shared savings completely. We are concerned about this all-or-nothing approach and are certain that such an abrupt cutoff will deter APM participation. Accordingly, we recommend that if an ACO completely reports and does not meet the Minimum Performance Level, the maximum shared savings rate should be multiplied by the quality score as it is today. In this way the ACO will receive shared savings proportionate to their quality performance, and ACOs that do not meet the threshold for a measure with narrow distribution or due to natural statistical variation will not be unduly punished.", "138": "Proposal to change the MSSP Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Policy for ACOs We support the proposal to change the MSSP Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Policy for ACOs to set the minimum quality performance score for affected ACOs to equal the higher of the ACO\u2019s quality score or the 40th percentile MIPS Quality performance category score.", "139": "Proposal to change PY 2020 quality reporting to account for PHE We thank CMS for flexibilities granted during the PHE, and appreciate CMS\u2019 recognition that the extraordinary events of 2020 will have a long and lasting impact on the industry and measures we use.

Accordingly, we support CMS\u2019 proposal to expand the definition of primary care services for beneficiary assignment to include various telehealth codes and Chronic Care Management. We also support the exclusion of Advance Care Planning codes billed in inpatient settings from assignment methodology. Telehealth Regulatory flexibilities related to telehealth have helped us continue to provide high quality care to our patients during the pandemic, and we thank CMS for quickly enacting these changes. The pandemic has forever altered health care delivery, and for this reason we strongly recommend that CMS make permanent the telehealth flexibilities extended during the PHE.", "142": "Although we do not know the total impact, our biggest concern with removing the Web Interface as a reporting mechanism is cost. To report similar CQM type measures, large practices are left only with registry reporting as an option, if they are not set up to report via EHR. The majority of QCDR or QRs charge per provider and that could have a SIGNIFICANT budgetary impact on these practices. Alerting these practices in late 2020, would not give them enough time to change budgets and participation strategies already set for next year. If CMS opts to finalize its proposal to sunset the Web Interface reporting option, we request that it at least delay this decision by a year to give practices time to prepare for this transition.", "143": "In this rule, CMS proposed to establish an Alternative Payment Pathway (APP) under which an eligible clinician participating in Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) could meet the quality reporting requirements of the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) by reporting on one set of quality measures. We have long supported streamlining requirements for providers in at-risk arrangements and have suggested in the past that providers participating in these arrangements should be allowed to report fewer quality measures.", "144": "We applaud CMS\u2019s proposal to remove the CMS Web Interface collection type. We agree with CMS\u2019s comments in the proposed rule that there is a need for specific-specialty information from large multispecialty groups. Under the current MIPS program, these large multispecialty groups report only primary care measures on a limited number of patients under the Web Interface reporting method. It is important that CMS require specialty reporting from these large groups to ensure accountability for the quality of specialty care at large multi-specialty practices. We strongly support requiring large multi-specialty groups to report on specialty measures, and we further ask CMS to encourage participation among these large groups in specialty-led QCDRs. Specialty-led QCDRs provide a valuable and unique source of specialty-specific quality data that is not collected elsewhere and is critical to understanding the entire value equation. Without incentives for large, multi-specialty practices to report on specialty-specific quality metrics, CMS is limiting the performance data available to patients regarding the quality of care that specialty doctors provide. We believe this undermines CMS\u2019s efforts to encourage specialists to meaningfully engage in MIPS.", "145": "In November of 2017, CMS published an Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances (EUC) Interim Final Rule in response to the wildfires and Hurricanes Maria, Irma, and Harvey. The Academy applauds CMS\u2019s continued commitment to ensuring that clinicians affected by major disasters receive automatic extreme and uncontrollable circumstances exceptions, we are concerned, however, that the policy is not being applied as finalized. The policy, as finalized, provided automatic MIPS extreme and uncontrollable circumstances hardship exemptions to clinicians impacted by a CMS-designated extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, including FEMA-declared major disasters and CMS-declared emergencies. When CMS finalized that the exception would be automatic, the rationale was that clinicians in these areas are already burdened by major disaster and caring for vulnerable patients who are also vulnerable after major disasters. While the Academy appreciates CMS\u2019s desire to encourage quality reporting under MIPS, we are concerned with CMS\u2019s approach of not applying the automatic EUC policy to the COVID19 public health emergency (PHE) in performance year 2020. CMS has identified COVID-19 as a current emergency, FEMA has declared COVID-19 to be a major disaster across the country, and CMS is applying the EUC policy automatically to MSSP organizations that do not report or inadequately report quality during the 2020 performance year due to COVID19. We would also note that CMS provided an automatic EUC to clinicians that did not report 2019 MIPS due to the COVID-19 PHE. 8 We would highlight that the reporting period took place near the beginning of the pandemic\u2019s course in the United States. Since that time, the healthcare sector\u2019s financial stability has negatively impacted by the reduction or cessation of elective procedures and a sharp decline in outpatient visits (in person or telehealth).3 Most practices have had to lay off or furlough clinical workers and administrative staff to remain open.4,5 It will take years for the healthcare sector to recover. Despite this, and despite the likely significant impacts the pandemic and resultant delays in care will have on quality performance, CMS has stated that the COVID-19 PHE does not qualify for the automatic EUC. With so many healthcare providers struggling financially to stay open and expending all of their focus on the patients who need them, removing the potential for an up to 9% penalty for providers that are truly struggling could allow them to remain open. The more practices that close, the further increased barriers to care will be, which would greatly decrease care quality, particularly during a pandemic. We encourage CMS to apply the automatic MIPS EUC policy to the COVID-19 PHE for the 2020 MIPS performance year to allow clinicians to be able to focus on the COVID-19 PHE and their patients without worrying.", "146": "Health eFilings supports CMS\u2019 proposal to establish an APM Performance Pathway (APP).

In addition, the alignment of APP reporting with the MIPS program will minimize the barrier of practices transitioning to an APM. [...]\nHealth eFilings agrees with CMS\u2019 proposal to eliminate the CMS Web Interface reporting option.

CMS has previously stated that desire to remove silos from the MIPS program. Health eFilings commends CMS for including eCQMs within the APP Quality Measures and recommends that CMS build upon this by replacing the Administrative Claims measures with eCQMs. The eCQMs fundamentally tie the use of technology to the Quality category by encouraging the proper use of EHRs. Additionally, this provides the benefit of increased reliability on the data based upon not having human manipulation or intervention between the documentation and reporting to CMS. Under MIPS, CMS has eliminated claims-based reporting for large practices due to the data not being reliable or cost-effective for a practice to capture. Including Administrative Claims measures within the APM reporting is counterintuitive to this and eCQMs could better serve CMS\u2019 needs within the APM reporting Quality measure list.", "148": "We have participated in the several rulemaking cycles related to the MSSP, most recently with the\nPathways to Success initiative in CY 2019.15 Here the Agency makes numerous proposals related to the\nMSSP, some for PY2020 and PY2021 in relation to the PHE, and others for subsequent PYs beyond the\npresumed conclusion of the PHE.16 We do not address each of these in detail here, but rather direct the\nAgency to public commentary submitted by our colleagues at NAACOS, AAMC, and AHA.

Finally, we note that the proposed changes would require\nsignificant time and resources to implement and, if finalized as proposed, would occur during a time in\nwhich we are still navigating the COVID-19 PHE and its consequences. We recommend that CMS delay\nany significant changes to the MSSP quality standard until 2022 to allow providers the sufficient time\nand availability of resources to adapt.", "150": "CMS proposes to update the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy under the MSSP\nconsistent with its proposal to align the quality reporting requirements for MSSP with the proposed APP.\nCMS would set the minimum quality performance score for an ACO affected by an extreme and\nuncontrollable circumstance during the performance year to equal the 40th percentile MIPS Quality\nperformance category score. CMS would use the higher of the ACO\u2019s MIPS Quality performance\ncategory score or the 40th percentile MIPS Quality performance category score. CMS seeks comment on\nthese proposed revisions to the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy for the PY 2021 and\nsubsequent PYs. CMS also seeks comment on a potential alternative extreme and uncontrollable\ncircumstances policy for PY 2022 and subsequent years.\nWe would encourage CMS to refrain from making further changes to the MSSP extreme and\nuncontrollable circumstances policy at this time. Given the numerous changes to the MSSP extreme anduncontrollable circumstances policy made over the last two years -- including those made during the\nPHE to account for impacts arising out of COVID-19 -- we encourage CMS to avoid any additional\nsignificant policy changes as we collectively continue to assess the impacts of COVID-19 and have more\nexperience and data to share that might better inform additional changes to the established policy.", "151": "As noted above, Ascension\u2019s MSSP ACOs were also able to leverage CMS\u2019s expanded definition of\n\u201cprimary care services\u201d, which temporarily includes codes for virtual check-ins, e-visits, and telephone\ncommunication, for purposes of establishing and maintaining patient attribution to ACOs. This has\nallowed for more accurate assignment of beneficiaries throughout the pandemic. And since we\nanticipate that these services will continue to be readily offered by our ACO clinicians and utilized by\nbeneficiaries, we strongly support CMS\u2019s proposal to make permanent this revised definition.\nWe also echo the recommendation made by NAACOS that CMS use a two-year assignment window for\nMSSP to account for potential variations in attribution in 2020 and 2021. Changes in patient behavior in\nresponse to concerns about COVID-19, and especially in light of the upcoming flu season, have resulted\nin healthy patients forgoing and continuing to forgo routine primary care. These behavioral shifts will\ninvariably impact assignment for MSSP ACOs, regardless of whether they use retrospective or\nprospective attribution. We therefore encourage CMS to consider patient visits from both 2019 and\n2020 for purposes of all ACOs\u2019 assignment lists. This will help create more consistent and accurate\nassignment lists.", "152": "We appreciate CMS\u2019s ongoing efforts to minimize burdens associated with the repayment mechanism.\nWe support both of CMS\u2019s repayment proposals and encourage the agency to finalize them as\nproposed. At the same time, we also encourage the agency to take additional steps to further reduce\nthe burdens associated with repayment mechanism requirements. Many ACOs cite the burden and cost\nof securing a repayment mechanism as primary barriers against moving to a risk-based ACO model. To\neliminate third party transactional fees that detract from investments in patient care, we urge CMS to\nremove the repayment mechanism requirement when an ACO can demonstrate that it has an investor\nor financial backer with a high credit rating. Financial backers could include outside investors, insurers,\nor hospitals or health systems that are aligned with the ACO and committed to providing financial\nsupport should losses occur. This flexibility would protect ACOs\u2019 finances, as well as the federal fisc, and\neliminate the need for a 24-month tail period, which is an additional burden on ACOs. At the very least,\nif CMS continues to require a repayment mechanism, we encourage the agency to minimize associated\nregulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for a tail period, which is increasingly\nimportant in light of longer agreement periods.", "153": "CMS proposes to retire the CMS Web Interface. Under this policy, ACOs would be required to report\nelectronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs) via an Electronic Health Record (EHR) or MIPS CQMs\nvia a qualified registry or Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR).\nWe recommend that the sunsetting of the CMS Web Interface be delayed. This will allow providers\nmore time to prepare for a full year of data collection using an alternate submission method\nthrough the EHR. Waiving the HCAHPS 2020 Survey\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS is proposing several flexibilities for MSSP to help alleviate the\nburden on providers. These flexibilities include automatically giving all providers full points for the\nHospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) within the patient\nexperience domain for performance year 2020.\nWhile AHPA supports the proposal to waive the HCAHPS survey for 2020, we request that CMS\nfinalize this policy before this final rule is released either through a separate guidance or\nmemorandum. HCAHPS surveys are scheduled to be sent out to patients around December, which is the\nsame time period in which the final rule is expected to be released. Without a finalized policy, providers\nand vendors will be pressured to launch the survey, as they will not know with certainty whether CMS\nwill finalize the proposed policy. Knowing CMS\u2019 final policy earlier will allow providers and vendors to\nbetter manage their resources.\nRevising the Methodology Used to Assign Beneficiaries to ACOs\nDuring the COVID-19 PHE, CMS added to the definition of primary care used in the MSSP assignment\nmethodology codes for remote evaluations, virtual check-ins, e-visits and telephone E/M services. CMS\nconsidered but ultimately declined to propose adding these codes on a permanent basis.\nAHPA requests that CMS reconsider this proposal and would recommend adding these codes on a\npermanent basis to assign beneficiaries in MSSP. We believe the pandemic has changed how primary\ncare is delivered and believe that patients will continue to demand and expect reduced barriers to\ntelehealth access.\nAssigning Doctors in MSSP on a National Provider Identification Level\nAHPA also recommends that CMS assign doctors to an MSSP program on a National Provider\nIdentifier (NPI) level rather than on a Tax Identification Number (TIN) level. Currently, the MSSP\nprogram aligns physicians at the TIN level, which makes it hard for groups to exclude certain types of\nproviders that are not well suited for case management. The inclusion of these types of providers,\nincluding transplant surgeons, oncologists, anesthesiologists and hospitalists, discourages some groups\nfrom participating in MSSP. To reduce the attrition rate in the program, CMS should consider structuring\nthe program similarly to the Direct Contracting model, which uses NPIs to target the right type of\nprovider. This would also prevent overlap between the Direct Contracting model and MSSP.", "154": "There has already been significant changes to the structure of the MSSP program through the\nimplementation of the New Pathways approach. Additional changes, particularly changes to\nmeasurements, significantly disrupt ACOs as they continue to adapt to a new program structure.\nImplementing such changes during the PHE only complicate matters. This is not to say we\noppose modification to and evolution of the program \u2013 rather, we support meaningful review and\nchanges that are difficult to develop and measure during the ongoing PHE.\nWe urge CMS to not set any date certain to move forward with revisions at this time.\nRather, we encourage CMS to utilize a separate request for information to gather\nstakeholder input once the PHE emergency concludes. This will allow for adequate review\nand consideration of suggested revisions and weighting of appropriate measures.\nMore specifically, CMS has proposed to end the use of the Web Interface reporting option as\nwell as removing the pay-for reporting year. Both the AHA and National Association of ACOs\n(NAACOS) outline substantial concerns with these two items. We echo their concerns.\nCMS is proposing to eliminate the Web Interface reporting option because its use outside of the\nMSSP program is limited. As the program is intended to improve the care for Medicare\nbeneficiaries, utilizing a different reporting system that includes all-payer data is questionable.\nAdditionally, MSSP has different measure specifications which could result in different scores\neven when reporting the same measure title. Unfortunately, we do not believe the proposal addresses how to reconcile potential performance differences among ACOs that may stem from\ndifferences in data collection types.\nAdditionally, CMS is proposing to eliminate the pay-for-reporting for first year of MSSP\nparticipation, as we well as pay-for-reporting for newly added or significantly revised measures.\nPay-for-reporting periods give ACOs the opportunity to ramp up their measurement and\nimprovement capabilities in a sustainable fashion before their shared services or losses are tied to\nquality performance. Significant changes to existing measure specifications require providers to\nmake several of these same adaptations. As MSSP ACOs are scored on improvement over time,\nit is essential to establish an accurate performance baseline, thus necessitating the continuation of\npay-for-reporting.\nWe urge CMS to continue both the existing Web Interface reporting option and pay-forreporting", "155": "Integra appreciates CMS\u2019s efforts to streamline the scoring and reporting under the new APM\nPerformance Pathway (APP).

Additional resources would be\nneeded to implement these changes. These operational changes, along with the proposed quality threshold\nincrease, could jeopardize our ability achieve quality performance results and shared savings consistent with\nour past performance.\nWe are concerned that the timing of proposed changes during the COVID -19 pandemic presents an undue\nhardship for physicians, in light of the uncertainty of the Public Health Emergency (PHE).

While we understand that this proposal for the participation in an APP will be optional, this is a brand new pathway to providers and may be confusing with other changes of sunsetting the APM scoring standard, CMS web interface measures, and adding the MIPS APM type to the participation statuses.\nGreenway supports sun-setting the APM scoring standard and adding MIPS APM type to the participation statuses under MIPS, which aligns with the sunset of the CMS web interface measures.

For this reason, we request CMS permit APMs to report via the APP or Web Interface in PY2021 to allow additional time for APMs to implement the health information technology needed to report via APP.

In addition to the potential for reduced sample size, we anticipate a high \u201cskip\u201d rate as urgent or emergent care encounters have replaced some preventive care visits during the PHE. For this reason, we request CMS reduce the sample size commensurate with the reduction in ambulatory services (roughly 15%-20% based on analysis by Milliman) as a result of the PHE, and wave the \u201cskip\u201d rate thresholds for PY2020 reporting.\nIn addition, given that repayment of PY2019 losses are due during the PHE, we request CMS extend the \u201cExtreme and Uncontrollable Circumstance Policy\u201d to reduce or wave the repayment of PY2019 losses until the PHE has ended.

Comments: While there is appreciation for CMS's goal of aligning methodologies across programs, I do not support CMS proposals to make such sweeping, drastic changes to how ACO quality is reported and assessed for the MSSP, especially given these drastic changes come amidst the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE). ACOs and healthcare providers are continuing to focus on patient care during this unprecedented time and uncertainty that the COVID-19 PHE is bringing to the health care industry. At a minimum, I urge CMS to postpone making drastic structural changes at this time to the way ACO quality is reported, assessed, and how it impacts shared savings and losses. Proposal to Change the MSSP Measure Set from 23 to 6 measures: CMS proposes to dramatically decrease the number of measures which ACOs are evaluated on for MSSP quality performance and assessment (table 36 on page 50233 of proposed rule). Comment: Moving from 23 measures down to only 6 measures is a drastic reduction, especially when combined with the proposed changed methodology for assessing ACOs on their ability to earn shared savings. Although I understand the goal to reduce burden and streamline measures, this is a very drastic reduction, and it will not reflect the true quality of an ACO. Specifically, it reduces the number of clinical quality measures to only 3 measures, it does not reflect other quality measures which are foundational to an ACO's quality improvement work with provenoutcomes, a third of the measures are focused on utilization measures (avoidable admission and readmissions) of which there is already a direct financial incentive to reduce these through MSSP, and there is a disproportional weight on patient experience measures compared to clinical and quality outcome measures. Proposal to Remove the Web Interface Reporting Mechanism: CMS proposes to eliminate the Web Interface as a reporting method for ACOs starting in performance year 2021. CMS would instead require ACOs to report on 3 quality measures for all patients, regardless of payor, using a registry or direct via electronic health records (EHRs) using electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) standards. Comment: This sunsetting of the Web Interface for performance year 2021 would result in ACOs being given extremely little notice and cause undue burden on ACOs to make a significant reporting change starting with the performance period beginning January 1, 2021. Other concerns with this drastic change include it evaluates quality for all patients the ACO's providers serve, not only ACO assigned patients, which would not provide a true evaluation of the ACO's MSSP quality efforts and, additionally, it could raise contractual and legal concerns, as an ACO may not have the ability to access patient data for non ACO patients. Also, ACOs have invested significant investments on existing processes, workflows, tools and resources for performing, capturing, and reporting quality under the existing Web Interface reporting option. A switch to an alternative reporting option with extremely limited notice would result in significant time, added vendor costs, new mapping and workflows and resources to capture an accurate reflection of true quality under these alternate reporting methods.

Asking ACOs to shift to a new platform for the 2021 performance year places an undue administrative burden on organizations already struggling to cope with the myriad challenges posed by the COVID-19 PHE. We are particularly concerned that losing the current submission option will create undue additional work and financial burden for ACOs with participants using multiple types of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). As there is significant preparation needed on the operations and logistical side for this data system migration, we feel that the move from the Web Interface to the new platform should incorporate a more gradual on-ramp than the timeline proposed by CMS. A more protracted transition period critically would allow ACOs the time they need to engage with any needed new vendors, work with multiple EMR companies, create workflows that sustain the new data collection process, and implement any other changes that are necessary to successfully transition to the new platform. AAH strongly shares the agency\u2019s goal of promoting and fostering a successful ACO program; however, movement to the APP while ACOs continue to address the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic simply does not create the optimal structure for success and therefore AAH respectfully urges CMS to delay the transition to APP beyond the 2021 performance year.\nSecond, it is our understanding the Electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs) and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) CQMs require data submissions on all patients, all payors. However, due to privacy protections, ACOs cannot have access to patient information outside of their attributed MSSP patients. This new data submission process therefore provides a layer of complexity and potential liability for ACOs to report all patients, all payors. Thus, AAH respectfully urges CMS to rescind this requirement and not put ACOs in a situation that poses privacy compliance concerns.", "182": "Third, AAH recognizes that a reduction in quality measures is generally supported and reduces provider reporting burden. However, we are concerned that the proposed decrease in the number of measures from 23 to 6 is a significant reduction and one that might not allow for providers to report enough information to appropriately reflect the quality of care provided. Coupling this change with the proposed increase in attainment in quality performance is significantly problematic, especially when facing the challenges and uncertainty caused by COVID-19.\nFinally, we also have concerns with some of the proposed measures themselves. For example, CMS proposes to place a greater emphasis on the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) measures with the new APP scoring standard. We agree with CMS that patient and caregiver input is needed and valuable for any quality improvement program. However, we believe that CAHPS is an antiquated way of capturing this important patient experience insight. We thus highly encourage CMS to move away from paper CAHPS surveys and instead allow providers to utilize real-time, electronic surveys. (Please see our additional comments regarding CAHPS further below.) Further, we are concerned that the screening for depression and follow-up plan measure, although important, has been riddled with measurement challenges for the last several years and is not an outcomes measure. Therefore, we highly encourage CMS to select another measure within the APP measures set to capture quality of care. For example, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Flu vaccine or Pneumonia vaccine measure might be a more appropriate metric for capturing quality of care in the current environment.", "183": "We would appreciate clarity from CMS regarding what the agency intends by achieving \u201ca quality performance score equivalent to the 40th percentile or above across all MIPS Quality performance category scores.\u201d If ACOs will be required to achieve a score at or above the 40th percentile for each of the six measures, we are extremely concerned that the proposed new Quality Performance Standard will be far too stringent and will have the unintended consequence of driving otherwise successful ACOs out of the program \u2013 clearly not a goal of the agency. If, on the other hand, CMS intends with the proposal that ACOs will receive a composite score and ranking, such an approach may be more feasible and less punitive. Regardless, we would require additional details regarding the scoring methodology before we can understand and support this proposed change.", "184": "We also respectfully oppose the proposed removal of the pay-for-reporting year for newly formed ACOs and for new/updated measures. We recognize that often when first engaging in quality reporting the effort is more about data collection than it is about the quality of care provided. Clinicians, systems, and ACOs require adequate time and resources to implement workflows so that data can be appropriately collected and accurately capture the care provided \u2013 and for providers to review and understand the data to help inform quality improvement efforts going forward. The pay-for-reporting year and for individual measure changes importantly provides this ramp up opportunity for ACOs to be successful with quality reporting. This appropriate and necessary transitional year helps to ensure there are no unintended consequences or flaws in the measure\u2019s specifications before holding an ACO accountable for performance in the measure. Indeed, removing pay-for-reporting only places additional burden on those providing care by requiring new reporting without resources to support it. Thus, AAH respectfully urges CMS to not go forward with its proposal to remove the pay-for-reporting year for newly formed ACOs and for new/updated measures.", "185": "We are pleased that CMS is proposing the permanent inclusion of certain telehealth codes in the definition of primary care services for the purposes of beneficiary assignment. AAH has increased telehealth services exponentially (an 8,606.6% increase - 726,000 virtual visits as of September 26, 2020) due to the PHE and expects that volume for these types of visits will remain elevated even after the PHE ends. Therefore, these changes will be necessary to accurately reflect our patient population\u2019s health care utilization going forward.", "186": "We support and appreciate the CMS proposal to waive the CAHPS for ACOs\u2019 reporting requirement and automatically award ACOs all of the points for the patient/caregiver domain for PY2020. We agree with CMS\u2019 concerns regarding inadequate sample size and inability to generalize results of this survey because of the impact of the current Public Health Emergency. Further, we have had complaints from patients that paper surveys are not a sanitary choice for gathering feedback and, as noted above, we strongly encourage CMS to allow for patients to provide feedback via more timely electronic surveys going forward.", "187": "We strongly support and appreciate the agency\u2019s proposal to use the higher of an ACO\u2019s 2020 quality performance score or its 2019 quality performance score for ACOs that report complete quality data for 2020. We feel this is a balanced approach that incentivizes ACOs to accurately and completely submit quality data for 2020, but appropriately recognizes that program participants should not be held accountable for unforeseen circumstances and consequences stemming from the global pandemic, all of which are outside of providers\u2019 control. We very much appreciate the flexibility CMS has demonstrated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to support providers and the delivery of high-quality care in challenging and unforeseen circumstances.", "188": "First, replacing the current domain-based quality scoring approach with an all or nothing standard is a significant change that will have a big impact on ACO performance.", "189": "Secondly, drastically reducing the number of quality measures from 23 to six de-emphasizes quality and will create a performance standard that may not be truly representative of an ACO's actual quality improvement efforts. Thirdly, abruptly removing the Web Interface as a reporting mechanism will have a big impact on ACOs' ability to get credit for their true quality efforts. CMS should continue to offer the Web Interface as an option and over time allow additional reporting options to those ACOs who would be ready to implement, such as registry or Electronic Health Record (EHR) reporting. Additionally, moving to the alternative reporting options CMS has provided through the proposed APM Performance Pathway (APP) would cause many ACOs to have to pay for registries and/or EHR upgrades and dashboards to capture the correct data to be able to report to CMS. Finally, there are remaining questions regarding how the ACO would report the data for non-Medicare and non-ACO patient data, which is required when reporting using a registry or EHR. This could cause ACOs to have to revisit contracts and could raise legal concerns as the ACO does not typically have access to non-ACO patient data.\n\nFinally, we also have deep concerns with CMS's proposal to remove the pay-for-reporting year currently provided to first time ACOs as well as quality measures that are newly introduced or undergo significant changes. ACOs use the pay-for-reporting year as a time to get the correct processes and performance dashboards in place to be able to be successful in their quality improvement efforts. These are critical and removing them while still holding ACOs accountable for new quality measures, as an example, is unfair and will cause ACOs to hesitate to enter the program.", "190": "CMS proposes significant changes to the method for assessing, reporting and evaluating ACO quality under the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) and Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). Changes proposed include elimination of the Web Interface, reducing the number of quality measures from 23 to six, and increasing the quality performance standard from the 30th percentile to the 40th percentile. At a time when ACOs are experiencing major challenges due to the COVD-19 PHE, a significant restructuring of the MSSP quality program will be difficult for ACOs to implement. More feedback should be collected before moving forward with such drastic changes. While the AAMC understands CMS\u2019 desire to align the Shared Savings Program, and the MIPS program, and to modify the quality standards for ACOs, we encourage CMS to postpone for at least one year any changes to the current quality scoring program.\n\nCMS Should Maintain the Web Interface Reporting Option and Allow ACOs to Use Other Reporting Mechanisms\nBeginning in 2021, without prior warning, CMS proposes to terminate the CMS Web Interface, which is the mechanism that ACOs use to report quality measures. If CMS terminates, the Web Interface in January 2021, ACOs would need to rapidly make changes to enable them to report using MIPS clinical quality measures using a registry or to report electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs) through their electronic health records (EHRs). We urge CMS to maintain the Web Interface as a reporting option for ACOs while also allowing ACOs the option of using other reporting mechanisms.\nMaking the switch to these alternative reporting options will cost many ACOs considerable time, money, and effort in changing workflows, paying for registries and adapting and modifying EHRs to comply with eCQM standards. Physicians and other health care professionals will need training to adjust to the new workflows. It is also important to recognize that ACOs use different approaches to combining clinical data across the ACO, which makes changes to reporting more challenging. Some ACOs have all of their participants on the same EHR platform, while others have participants that use multiple different EHRs. Clarity is needed on whether the ACO will be responsible for reporting MIPS CQMs or eCQMs for all of its participants or whether instead ACO participants will be able to report data directly to CMS to then aggregate for ACO scoring. This is critical for the ACOs with participants on multiple platforms, as it will be challenging to merge the data from the different EHRs to report MIPS CQMs or eCQMs. They will need to determine how to combine the data from each system, which will require the use of an outside vendor and will be costly.\nWe also recommend that additional time be provided to allow CMS to provide further clarification on how reporting MIPS CQM through registries will apply to ACO measurement, particularly with regard to benchmarks used and the population measured. Under the MIPS program, the benchmarks are determined separately for MIPS CQMs, eCQMs, and the Web Interface. CMS should clarify how the benchmarks would be set for MSSP ACOs when they use each of these reporting options. In addition, CMS should clarify whether ACO quality scoring would be based on patients that are assigned to the ACO or on all patients served by the ACO\u2019s participants. We recommend that the ACOs quality score be based only on the patients assigned to the ACO to accurately measure the ACO\u2019s quality efforts. The ACO does not have the same flexibilities to design care interventions for non-assigned patients and may not have the ability to access patient data for the non-ACO patients.\nTo give ACOs more time to prepare, and to allow CMS to develop and disseminate guidance on how this change will be operationalized, we urge CMS to provide a more gradual transition away from the use of the Web Interface reporting option until at least the 2022 performance period", "191": "AAMC Supports Expanding the Definition of Primary Care Services Used in MSSP Assignment\nCMS proposes to expand the definition of primary care services used to determine MSSP assignment in its regulations to include the following additions beginning January 1, 2021:\n\u2022 online digital evaluation and management CPT codes 99421, 99422, and 99423;\n\u2022 assessment of and care planning for patients with cognitive impairment CPT code 99483;\n\u2022 chronic care management code CPT code 99491;\n\u2022 non-complex chronic care management HCPCS code G2058 and its proposed\nreplacement CPT code, if finalized in this CY 2021 PFS rulemaking\npsychiatric collaborative care model HCPCS code GCOL1, if finalized in this CY 2021 PFS rulemaking\nThe AAMC supports the addition of these services to the primary care services used for MSSP assignment and also recommends the addition of G2010 and G2012 to the list.", "192": "Update to Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Policies\nCMS proposes to update the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy under the MSSP\nconsistent with its proposal to align the quality reporting requirements for MSSP with the\nproposed APP. Specifically, for performance year 2021 and subsequent performance years, CMS\nwould set the minimum quality performance score for an ACO affected by an extreme and\nuncontrollable circumstance during the performance year to equal the 40th percentile MIPS Quality performance category score. AAMC supports this update.", "193": "CMS Should Seek Stakeholder Input Prior to Implementing Quality Measure Set\nCMS proposes to apply the proposed APM Payment Pathway (APP) to ACO clinicians beginning with performance year 2021 as a successor to the APM scoring standard. The APP measure set consists of 6 measures chosen to focus on population health and care delivered through APMs. MSSP ACOs would be required to report three measures (HbA1c Poor Control, Depression Screening and Follow-Up Plan, Controlling High Blood Pressure) and field the CAHPS survey. CMS would score the remaining two measures using administrative claims. The APP measure set would suffice for reporting under MIPS and, under the MSSP, the measure set also would be used to determine quality-based eligibility for sharing in any savings.\nWe appreciate the significant reduction in measures as it eases reporting burden. However, we recommend CMS seek stakeholder input prior to implementing this measure set for ACOs from the Measures Application Partnership (MAP) and others. The MAP is responsible for evaluating measures for the MSSP to ensure the measures fit the program prior to implementation. The MAP has not had the opportunity to review this measure set.\nAAMC Recommends Maintaining the Pay-for-Reporting Year\nCMS proposes to remove the pay-for-reporting year for ACOs beginning an initial MSSP contract as well as individual measures that are newly introduced to the measure set or measures that undergo significant changes. We recommend CMS maintain the pay-for reporting year as it gives ACOs time to evaluate and make changes as needed to their processes, workflows, and other operations to ensure that their quality improvement initiatives are effective and that they are appropriately capturing quality data. In addition, it is important to allow a pay for reporting year for new measures or measures with significant changes to ensure that there are no unintended consequences or flaws in the measure.", "194": "CMS is proposing to revise the MSSP quality performance standard for performance year 2021\nand subsequent performance years. Under this new proposal, MSSP accountable care organizations (ACOs) would be required to report quality for purposes of the MSSP via the APP.\nCMS states that this new pathway would replace the current MSSP quality measure set.\nAdditionally, ACOs would need to report only one set of quality metrics that would satisfy the\nreporting requirements under both MIPS and the MSSP.\nWhile AMGA supports burden reduction and streamlining quality reporting for entities\nparticipating in value-based models, we are concerned about the extent to which CMS is\nreducing the MSSP quality measure set. The APP would score MSSP ACOs on six quality\nmeasures; ACOs would be required to actively report on three measures. We are especially\nconcerned with the fact that two out of the six of these measures are utilization measures, which\nraises concerns about the lack of diversification in the measurement set. Further, reducing the\nnumber of measures by this drastic an amount could put too much emphasis on any one\nparticular measure. For example, an ACO could perform well on five of the six measures but fail\non one measure and their payments would be impacted disproportionately because they would\nbe ineligible for any shared savings. This is particularly concerning, as the line between success\nand failure on a measure can be incredibly thin. For example, there is a less than 1% difference\nbetween the 30th percentile and the 90th percentile for the 2020 benchmark targets for ACO-8\n\u201cRisk standardized, all condition readmission.\u201d With such a narrow window, factors outside the\ncontrol of the ACO and its providers can prevent an otherwise successful ACO from earning\nshared savings. In addition, those high-performing ACOs that have successfully reduced\nadmissions likely will have a subset of patients who are more likely to be admitted and\nsubsequently readmitted due to their health status and condition, despite the best efforts of the\nACO and its providers.\nOur members also report that the burden associated with ACO quality measurement reporting is\nnot due to the number of MSSP program measures, but rather the year-to-year changes that\nCMS requires of ACOs. AMGA members also must contend with the lack of alignment in\nmeasures from program to program (i.e., each program\u2014MSSP, Medicare Advantage, traditional\nfee-for-service, and commercial contracts\u2014has its own set of quality measures).\nTherefore, AMGA opposes this change in the number of measures and encourages CMS to\nimplement a better mix of outcomes and process measures that will align across these many\nprograms and payers. Additionally, ACOs will report most of these measures (CAHPS and the\nutilization measures) without the ACO being able to review and verify their performance on\nthese measures. ACOs need to be able to review and verify their quality performance to ensure\nthat the results reported are accurate. For these reasons, we would urge CMS to seek more\nstakeholder input on the kinds of quality measures that are appropriate and properly capture\nthe way ACOs deliver care before the agency attempts to implement such a major change within\nthe program.\nIn proposing the APP, CMS states that \u201cunder this proposal, there would be no quality \u2018phase in.\u2019\nAll ACOs, regardless of performance year and agreement period, would be scored on all the\nmeasures in the APP for purposes of the Shared Savings Program quality performance standard.\u201d\nAMGA strongly opposes this idea. The pay-for-reporting year is crucial for ACO providers to\nadjust to the new measures and benchmarks. The quality phase-in affords ACOs the time to\nacclimate to the program and learn how to deliver care in a value-based model. Additionally,\nACOs use the experience gleaned from the pay-for-reporting year to implement care processes,\nworkflow, and the health information technology changes needed to succeed in the model.", "195": "Removing the pay\nfor reporting period would have a negative impact on new ACOs, espec ially\nwith the new proposed quality performance standard that will apply to shared savings and\nshared losses.

We appreciate that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has considered how to reduce the required number of measures, provide flexibility in how measures are submitted and mitigate potential reductions in 2020 performance by using the higher of 2019 or 2020 scores. However, the timing of these changes is very concerning as ACOs continue to deal with the uncertainty that the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) is bringing to the health care industry. Additionally, the expected delayed release of the final rule further reduces the amount of time ACOs and other Alternative Payment Models (APMs) will have to implement such changes.

While this reduction in measures may simplify quality\nmeasure reporting and burden for ACOs, reducing the number of quality measures also limits the ability for consumers and\nhealthcare purchasers to meaningfully evaluate and compare the quality of providers participating in MIPS APMs.\nAdditionally, there are several measurement gaps among the proposed APP measure set of six population health-focused\nmeasures that could improve the adult immunization climate and bolster vaccinations as a public health priority and address\nbetter management of chronic diseases, particularly in light of the COVID-19 PHE.\nAmong adult patients, adherence to evidence-based guidelines and recommended vaccination schedules are still not\noptimal. The CDC has found that vaccination coverage for adults aged 65 and over varies by race, ethnicity and income\nlevel.\n14 This presents a clinical opportunity for more robust immunization measures, particularly in addressing health\ndisparities. Routine, guideline-recommend immunizations appear to align with the Meaningful Measures category of \u201cPromote\nEffective Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Disease\u201d. PhRMA is greatly supportive of the inclusion of guidelinerecommended immunization measures and we would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the importance of adherence to\nall Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)-recommended vaccinations, and the need for quality measures that\nare reflective of such guidelines.15 We urge CMS to consider the addition of immunization-related quality measures to any\nfinalized APP measure set to improve vaccination rates and public health overall.\nCMS is proposing two chronic-disease management measures to be included in the APP/MSSP measure set,\nrelating to diabetes and hypertension control.

The CDC has cited certain factors such as older age and certain underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes as posing a higher\nrisk for severe illness and hospitalizations.17\nPhRMA supports the inclusion of statin therapy measures that align with the 2019 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol\nguidelines.18 Nearly 70 percent of persons with diabetes aged 65 and older die from some form of heart disease and adults\nwith diabetes are two to four times more likely to die from", "205": "MSSP ACO Quality Scoring and Reporting\nCMS proposes to completely transform how ACOs participating in the MSSP are measured on quality\nperformance, as well as how ACOs will report performance to CMS. Specifically, in order to increase\nalignment with quality reporting in the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) under the QPP,\nCMS proposes to create a new Alternative Payment Model (APM) Performance Pathway (APP) in which\nthe number of ACO measures will be reduced from twenty-three to six, ACOs will be subject to a higher\nminimum attainment standard of the 40th percentile across these six measures to earn shared savings, the\npay-for-reporting year will be eliminated, and ACOs will utilize electronic clinical quality measures\n(eCQMs) rather than the CMS Web Interface reporting mechanism to report performance. As highlighted\nin comments submitted by the National Association of ACOs (NAACOS), AMA, American College of\nPhysicians (ACP), America\u2019s Essential Hospitals, America\u2019s Physician Groups (APG), American\nMedical Group Association (AMGA), Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), Federation\nof American Hospitals (FAH), Medical Group Management Association (MGMA), and Premier, these\nproposals are problematic for multiple reasons.\nFirst, while Novant Health supports meaningful measurement and administrative burden reduction\nwherever possible, reducing the number of ACO quality measures to six is concerning. Several measures\nslated for removal, including breast and colorectal cancer screenings, are foundational activities for\ndelivering true value to patients and should continue to be measured as an indicator of both ACO and\noverall program success. \n4\nSecond, Novant Health is concerned about the unintended consequences of changing how the minimum\nquality attainment standard impacts an ACO\u2019s ability to earn shared savings. Currently, ACOs are\nrequired to achieve at least the 30th percentile among all ACOs on at least one measure in each of the four\nrequired quality domains: Patient/Caregiver Experience, Care Coordination/Patient Safety, Preventive\nHealth, and At-risk Populations. Once this minimum threshold was achieved, the final ACO quality score\nwas multiplied by the maximum potential savings rate to determine the percentage of shared savings the\nACO would be eligible to retain. In the CY 2021 PFS proposed rule, CMS proposes that failure to surpass\nthe 40th percentile among all MIPS participants across the six proposed measures will result in forfeiture\nof all shared savings. With the high level of volatility created by the COVID-19 PHE and the high\nnumber of MIPS exemptions, this 40th percentile mark could be highly unpredictable and not an accurate\nindicator of performance.\nFurthermore, the elimination of the pay-for-reporting year for measures newly added to the ACO quality\nmeasure set negatively impacts ACO performance and the overall goals of the program. This year is an\nessential learning opportunity for both ACOs and CMS, as ACOs can build appropriate workflows and\nimplement necessary technological and operational changes while CMS is able to assess the efficacy and\naccuracy of the new measures and benchmarks.\nFinally, CMS\u2019 proposal to abruptly retire the CMS Web Interface reporting mechanism will create\nsubstantial operational burdens and challenges for ACOs, particularly given the ongoing COVID-19 PHE.\nThis reporting mechanism has been in place since the launch of the MSSP and ACOs have built all of\ntheir operational and data capture workflows for quality reporting around it. If it is indeed the ultimate\ndecision of CMS to move away from the CMS Web Interface reporting mechanism, Novant Health urges\nCMS to make this transition gradually. Delaying this provision until at least 2022 will give providers\nmore time to prepare for this transition", "206": "As an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) that reports quality measures through the CMS\nweb interface, we support CMS proposal to sunset the web interface and transition to MIPs\nreporting methods including MIPs Value Pathway.

Considering the tremendous amount of resources shifted\ntowards addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, we request that CMS delay this transition to\nreporting year 2022 instead of the proposed 2021 reporting year. This would allow all ACOs that\nare still reporting through the CMS web interface to understand the changes, select the measures\nthat support their population and implement any new technology to support the new method of reporting. At the very least, CMS could allow MSSP ACOs an alternative pathway and possibly\naward bonus points for ACOs that begin MIPs reporting in 2021 without penalizing those that\nare unable to make the transition.

These eCQMs must be reported for all patients, regardless of payer.\n\nComments: CMS proposes to abruptly end the use of the Web Interface reporting\nmechanism, a tool that has been used since the MSSP\u2019s inception. Removing this option for\nthe NHN ACO with little notice is ill-timed and unfair.\nCMS has not been clear regarding how the alternative MIPS reporting options will be\nutilized for ACOs (as APM Entities) specifically. There are several key questions and\nobstacles to moving away from this reporting method in this timeframe. For example, the\ncurrent remaining MIPS reporting options available under the APP would be registry (MIPS\nCQMs) and EHR (eCQMs). Using these reporting options would result in the NHN being\nevaluated on quality for all patients the NHN\u2019s providers serve, not only ACO assigned\npatients. This is not a true evaluation of the ACO\u2019s quality efforts and, additionally, raises\ncontractual and legal concerns, as an ACO may not have the ability to access patient data\nfor non-ACO patients. NHN providers have invested significant resources for development\nof reporting processes and workflows to optimize this process; removing web interface\nreporting option altogether would undermine these investments, thus diverting critical\nresources away from improving patient care.\nAdditionally, CMS has not stated if aggregation of data and performance calculations will\nhappen at the CMS level. Current Web Interface reporting allows for aggregation of\nperformance across the ACO and supports one data file submission. Reporting via the\neCQM method may not be possible if ACO participants have differing electronic medical\nrecords (EMRs). Current state eCQM reporting creates an aggregate report per TIN. ACOs\ncan have many different participating TINs, all of which could have different EMRs. If\naggregation of data and performance doesn\u2019t happen at the CMS level, ACOs would need\nto employ a third party data aggregation vendor in order to submit one data file at the APM\nentity level. This could add additional cost to ACOs.\nCMS should consider a transition away from the Web Interface reporting option, once\nconsideration is given to performance aggregation at the APM entity level and the option to\nreport eCQMs for only the attributed beneficiaries and not all patients and payers. This\nwould align with current structure of reporting only attributed beneficiaries while moving\nACOs away from Web Interface reporting. For example, CMS should work with industry\nleaders to create QRDAIII aggregate TIN level reporting for assigned beneficiaries. Then,\neach TIN would submit the QRDA III file via the QPP website and CMS would calculate\nperformance scores for the APM entity. Currently, practice level reporting is utilized for\nCPC+ and the upcoming Primary Care First model.\nFor these reasons, Nebraska Medicine urges CMS to provide a more gradual transition\naway from the use of the Web Interface reporting option to give more time and thought to\nhow this will practically be implemented and to give our ACO and our providers more time to\nassess alternatives.", "208": "While we appreciate CMS\u2019 efforts to reduce the reporting burden by developing a common\nset of quality measures regardless of which APM model a clinician or group participates in,\nwe are concerned that these measures will not capture the variability that exists between\ndifferent specialties. We encourage CMS to work with clinicians to ensure that common\nmeasure sets include measures that are broadly applicable to all clinicians regardless of\nspecialty. Our concerns also apply to use of these six measures in the Medicare Shared\nSavings Program (MSSP).", "209": "COVID-19 Impact on Quality Payment Programs and Risk-Bearing Arrangements:\nCOVID-19 has had and continues to have an unprecedented impact on hospitals, physicians,\nother clinicians, and the patients and communities they serve.

Given these facts and the uncertain trajectory of the virus\nas we approach flu/pneumonia season, it is imperative that CMS recognize the impact COVID19 has had on our health care system and adequately incorporate that impact into quality payment programs and risk-bearing arrangements.\nFor CY 2020 performance, for example, CMS is applying extreme and uncontrollable\ncircumstances policies within the MSSP.

Overall, we support many of the proposals in the latest PFS/QPP rule. In particular, extending access to\ntelehealth and virtual care will be invaluable for our clients, many of them rural, who have come to rely on\nvirtual care to maintain ongoing management of chronic disease and prevention. We also appreciate that CMS is\nrecognizing the value of office-based evaluation and management (E/M) services by increasing reimbursement.\nThis increased reimbursement appropriately reflects the time-intensive nature of these services, particularly\nwhen managing patients with serious chronic medical conditions.", "212": "However, we have concerns several of the proposals in the rule. Dramatically streamlining the number of quality\nmeasures on which ACOs will be assessed, as well as the drastic changes to the method by which ACOs are\nassessed, will have negative effects on the program. The value proposition of ACOs requires that they can\ndistinguish themselves on the excellent care provided, as well as cost-efficiency. Reducing the number of\nmeasures to 6, from the previous 23, makes it more difficult for ACOs to stand out and earn MIPS bonuses and\nshared savings. While it may be appropriate to reduce the burden on providers from reporting quality measures,\nwe are concerned that alternative payment models (APMs) would be disadvantaged compared to MIPS-eligible\nclinicians not participating in APMs. Similarly, making changes to the methods for submitting data during a\npublic health emergency puts inappropriate and undue burden on providers.", "213": "ACO Quality Measures\nCaravan Health is concerned that the proposed reduction in the number of MSSP ACO quality measures is not\nfair to participants in ACOs and other APMs participating in MIPS. While standard MIPS-eligible clinicians may\nstill have the option of choosing measures on which they will score well, ACOs would be limited to the smaller\nset of measures in the proposed rule. This inappropriately raises the bar for ACOs, putting them at a\ndisadvantage compared to those outside of alternative payment models. \n\nFurther, including fewer prevention measures is a step in the wrong direction for care quality. While several of\nthese measures that CMS proposes retaining have implicit process measures pertaining to prevention, those\nmeasures are not as robust as the current set of measures. With these changes, clinicians and patients would\nlose data from measures such as tobacco use, flu vaccinations, fall risk, and cancer screenings that give a fuller\npicture of preventive care performance.", "214": "The proposed increase in the quality performance standard could allow ACOs to more clearly differentiate\nthemselves from non-ACO providers.

We also support awarding full credit for CAHPS reporting in 2020. However, CMS can and should go much\nfurther in alleviating the result of the public health emergency on accountable care organizations. As we have\ncommented to CMS before, we urge CMS to pay all ACOs for reporting quality in 2020 or move to a new system\nthat would compensate for more critical activities during the public health emergency. The circumstances of the\npandemic will make precise differentiation of quality in primary care practices near impossible.

The timeline for these\nchanges should be fully aligned.\nAll the providers making up an APM entity should share in accountability, rather than have the option for\nexcluding themselves from shared reporting.

Caravan Health is\nfurther concerned that separately reporting on quality could disproportionately affect rural and smaller\nproviders.", "219": "We support the proposal to reduce the total number of measures in the quality measure set from 23 to 6, which would reduce reporting burden for providers and enable greater focus on a small number of high-impact measures. For the following measure -- Risk Standardized, All-Cause Unplanned Admission for Multiple Chronic Conditions for ACOs -- we recommend that CMS provide quarterly reports to ACOs that not only indicate their ACO\u2019s performance on this measure, but also include a list of ACO members that qualified for the measure denominator (members identified by CMS as having multiple chronic conditions). This will allow ACOs to optimize their internal patient identification processes, driving more targeted improvement on this measure. For other measures on the MSSP quality measures slate, such as diabetes: HbA1c Poor Control, CMS provides ACOs with a registry of members that are part of the diabetes cohort. We recommend that CMS offer ACOs a similar registry for the Unplanned Admissions for Multiple Chronic Conditions measure, which also involves cohort logic. While we support the aforementioned aspects of the APP, we would suggest delaying implementation until 2022 or later. If the proposed rule is finalized, ACOs would have little time to digest the new regulations and, importantly, move to a new reporting process. Forcing ACOs into the APP in 2021 may have an inadvertent negative impact on quality if ACOs cannot adequately review and refine their quality reporting strategies.", "220": "Furthermore, we do not support the proposal to raise the quality performance standard for MSSP ACOs (from the 30th to the 40th percentile) to be eligible to share in savings. This proposed change seems unnecessarily punitive and should be delayed until 2022 or later. For the same reason, we do not support the proposed changes to broaden the conditions under which CMS may terminate an ACO\u2019s participation in MSSP if an ACO fails to meet the quality performance standard, although we do recommend increasing the threshold at a future point in time.", "221": "Although we appreciate the effort to align MVP through a modified approach under the APP model by decreasing the number of measures for ACOs to report to 3 in the 2021 performance year, we believe CMS should retain the following measures from the Preventive Health Domain: \uf0b7 Quality ID#: 112 Breast Cancer Screening \uf0b7 Quality ID#: 113 Colorectal Cancer Screening \uf0b7 Quality ID#: 110 Preventive Care and Screening: Influenza Immunization We recognize this would increase the number of measures an ACO would report in the 2021 performance year but we feel these are important quality measures for our Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, the influenza vaccination measure for the 2021 performance year is of particular importance for this upcoming season in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. We strongly believe that the Web Interface reporting mechanism should still be considered an option to report quality in 2021 and onwards. In addition, there is very little time for ACOs to adapt to the new reporting requirements for the 2021 performance year if the final rule is expected towards the end of this year. More time is needed to migrate to other reporting mechanisms.", "222": "In addition, there are a number of changes that are being proposed in how quality will be evaluated starting in 2021. In the current proposal, performance scoring needs to be at or above the 40th percentile in order to meet the quality performance standard. CMS has noted that many ACOs perform well in quality under the current standards and thereby, increasing the standards to which an ACO needs to achieve in order to be eligible to earn shared savings. In addition, currently the CAHPS for ACO questions are counted as 10 individual measures in the Patient/Caregiver experience domain and in the proposed rule the CAHPS for MIPS survey related questions will be counted just as one measure. CMS is also proposing to wait until the 2021 reporting is complete to release the 2021 benchmarks. Currently, an ACO needs to achieve the 30th percentile on at least one measure in each domain to meet the minimum quality standard and be eligible for shared savings. We believe this requirement is achievable since the benchmarks are released early enough during the performance year, helping an ACO set goals throughout the year. In addition, there are enough measures in each domain to allow ACOs to meet the 30th percentile in at least one measure per domain. We believe the proposal to increase the minimum threshold from the 30th to the 40th percentile sets too high of a bar, especially if the 2021 benchmarks are not being released until after the 2021 performance year and the number of measures is reduce to six for 2021. We ask CMS to revisit the 40th percentile proposal and keep this at the 30th percentile for 2021. In addition, we ask CMS to consider allowing some or all measures to be pay-forreporting for the 2021 performance year due to the current public health emergency. We would also ask that CMS continue to award improvement points for ACOs who are able to increase their performance from one year to the next in order to recognize the work the ACO has undertaken to improve their quality score.", "223": "We support this proposal as well as waiving reporting requirements for CAHPS for ACOs by providing automatic full credit for the patient/caregiver experience domain due to the impact of COVID-19. We agree that the option to award the higher of 2019 or 2020 performance would reserve the option for ACOs who fully report on the 2020 quality performance measures, whereas ACOs who do not fully report quality for 2020 performance would be awarded the 2020 ACO mean quality score. New York City was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and there was reduced or delayed non-COVID care for several months during the 2020 performance year.

However, instead of CMS\u2019 proposal to waive participation in the ACO CAHPS survey for 2020 and provide full credit for patient experience measures, we strongly urge CMS to require ACOs to participate in the survey in a pay-for-reporting capacity or at least encourage interested ACOs to voluntarily participate in the survey. It is critical for ACOs to understand the experience of patients during this pandemic to ensure the quality, safety and equity of care delivery. To facilitate ACOs\u2019 participation, CMS should conduct its usual level of involvement in the survey administration process, i.e., select ACOs\u2019 patient samples and send the samples to authorized vendors. Press Ganey is ready and able to administer the survey and we have heard from several of our ACO partners that want to participate in the survey for their internal performance improvement efforts, even if CMS waives the requirement for 2020. Like the voluntary Spring 2020 administration of the InCenter Hemodialysis (ICH) CAHPS survey, ACOs could choose to voluntarily participate and contract with and authorize a vendor. CMS would then select the patient sample and send it to the authorized vendor. Lastly, the MIPS CAHPS survey is a voluntary quality measure within the MIPS Program and CMS is moving forward with the 2020 administration of the survey for MIPS-eligible clinician groups that 2 choose to participate. Given that CMS and MIPS CAHPS survey vendors are able to administer the survey and there are medical groups that voluntarily registered to participate, we urge CMS to provide the same opportunity to ACOs.\n\nALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODEL (APM) PERFORMANCE PATHWAY (APP) We support CMS\u2019 efforts to align quality reporting requirements within the Quality Payment Program (QPP) and specifically CMS\u2019 proposal for ACOs within the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) to use the MIPS CAHPS survey as a required measure in the proposed APP, instead of the ACO CAHPS survey. However, we urge CMS to continue to weight the CAHPS measures (i.e., Patient/Caregiver Experience domain) at 25 percent of the quality performance score. It is critical to not only capture the patient voice in measuring an ACO\u2019s performance, but also\u2014as CMS notes in the proposed rule\u2014to ensure it plays a significant role in quality scoring, to help drive performance improvement. Further, we urge CMS to require MIPS CAHPS for all ACOs, beyond just those participating in the MSSP. Requiring MIPS CAHPS for all ACOs and groups participating in MIPS would allow for the use of a streamlined measurement of patient experience across MIPS-eligible clinicians (see below for further discussion). Additionally, as part of the effort to align quality reporting requirements and reduce burden, we encourage CMS to incorporate patient experience, safety and reliability, clinical quality, equity, and caregiver engagement measures in both the MSSP and MIPS. Wherever possible, there should be similar standardized measures used in both programs to allow patients to make meaningful comparisons among providers and organizations, regardless of whether they participate in the MSSP or MIPS.", "226": "Summary of key recommendations: MSSP Proposals \u2022 Finalize a policy to provide ACOs with the higher of their 2019 or 2020 quality scores in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19, and make similar changes for 2021 as CMS continues to evaluate the impact of the pandemic in the coming year.", "227": "Summary of key recommendations: MSSP Proposals \n\u2022 Finalize proposals to provide automatic full points for each of the CAHPS survey measures within the patient/caregiver experience domain for ACOs in PY 2020.", "228": "Summary of key recommendations: MSSP Proposals \n\u2022 Do not finalize proposals to change the way ACOs are measured on and report quality measures.

While CCPM supports reducing reporting burdens and efforts to eliminate low value measures, these proposals go too far by reducing the number of clinical quality measures to a mere three measures.

Therefore, we support excluding advance care planning services from MSSP assignment when billed in an inpatient setting and also excluding professional services furnished by FQHCs or RHCs when delivered in a SNF. This change help create more complete and accurate patient assignment lists for ACOs, which is critical for us as an FQHC-led ACO.", "231": "Summary of key recommendations: MSSP Proposals  \n\u2022 Finalize the proposal to allow ACOs to lower their repayment mechanism amount if the recalculated amount for a new agreement period/year would be less than their current amount", "232": "While we appreciate CMS\u2019s goal of aligning methodologies across programs, we do not support CMS proposals to make such sweeping changes to how ACO quality is assessed, how quality data is reported, and how ACOs are evaluated on quality for both the MSSP and MIPS. Further, these changes come amidst the unprecedented COVID-19 PHE. The timing of these changes is very concerning as ACOs continue to deal with the uncertainty that the COVID-19 PHE is bringing to the health care industry. At a minimum we urge CMS to postpone making any structural changes to the way ACO quality is assessed or reported until at least 2022. Finally, while these proposed changes align more with the way individual clinicians and groups are scored in MIPS, it is a farther departure from the way CMS assesses other non feefor-service providers, such as Medicare Advantage. Therefore, this effort at alignment is a step backward for ACOs and those committed to value. Quality improvement is a cornerstone of the ACO model. In addition to reducing spending, ACOs must meet certain quality performance standards to be eligible to receive shared savings payments. ACOs continue to improve quality year over year, which improves patient care and helps to control costs. It is critical that CMS policies to evaluate ACO quality are fair, appropriate and accurately reflect the work ACOs undertake to improve patient care. CMS\u2019s proposals to change the way ACO quality is assessed, reported and scored for the purpose of shared savings calculation are significant and more feedback should be collected before moving forward with such drastic changes. Further, as stated in previous comments, CCHI strongly believes ACOs should not be evaluated and assessed in the same manner as all other APMs or individual MIPS clinicians. ACOs are high-quality performers, however, this should not serve as a reason for CMS to overhaul the entire quality performance assessment approach for the MSSP. Instead, we urge CMS to work with CCHI and other stakeholders to make changes to the current quality measure performance evaluation criteria and measure set for ACOs to further refine the measures and criteria as appropriate for a group of providers who are responsible for total cost of care for the populations they serve. Clinicians in MIPS who are not participating in total cost of care and full accountability payment models should not necessarily have the same quality measure set and scoring approach as ACOs. Likewise, each APM has specific goals and objectives, and the one size fits all approach under the proposed APP structure does not account for those differences. The proposed APP attempts to apply one approach to a multitude of providers and APMs. The current MIPS APM Scoring Standard, in comparison, allows each APM to have its own set of unique quality measures and scoring approaches that best fit a particular model. This approach allows specific APMs to have meaningful quality measures tailored to their model\u2019s goals while still providing credit for quality improvement efforts to those who are also subject to MIPS. The proposed APP approach would instead apply one set of quality measures for all APMs subject to MIPS. Therefore, each model participant would need to report not only their APM\u2019s specific quality measures, but also the APP quality measures (or other measures). This one size fits all approach results in more burden for APM participants and further may require the model participants to report on measures that are not applicable or appropriate. Finally, CCHI has concerns that this policy, which may allow APMs to choose to select measures to report outside the APP instead of relying on the APM\u2019s own quality measures as is currently done, would allow certain organizations to select measures for which they have the highest historical performance, not allowing for a true and fair assessment of quality\nimprovement efforts. We instead urge CMS to maintain the APM Scoring Standard approach.", "233": "The proposed six APP measures are a drastic reduction from the 23 measures ACOs are currently assessed on. While CCHI supports reducing reporting burdens and efforts to eliminate low value measures, we feel these proposals go too far by reducing the number of clinical quality measures to a mere three measures. Quality improvement is a critical and core component of an ACO\u2019s work. We therefore recommend CMS consider maintaining several key clinical quality measures that are foundational to an ACO\u2019s quality improvement work and have been proven to improve outcomes including: ACO-14, Influenza Immunization; ACO-19, Colorectal Cancer Screening; ACO-20, Breast Cancer Screening; and the previously used Pneumonia Vaccination measure. While ACOs can choose to continue to work on these preventive measures whether or not they are included in the MSSP\u2019s official measure list, we think it is critical for CMS to evaluate both individual ACOs and the program as a whole on these foundational prevention measures. Further, since the ACO program already gives ACOs a direct financial incentive to reduce avoidable admissions and readmissions, we do not feel it is appropriate to have one third of the total measure set focused on utilization measures. We also urge CMS to do more comparative research on how ACO quality on these core measures and improvement areas contrasts to non-ACO quality and to make the data and research findings public. This type of comparison cannot fairly be done if ACOs are only measured on one diabetes measure, one blood pressure measure, and one depression screening measure as proposed in the APP, nor does it reflect the true purpose and work ACOs do in the quality improvement space. Additionally, we have concerns with the Screening for Depression and Follow-Up Plan measure, as well as the Days at Home measure discussed but not formally proposed. Understanding the degree to which individuals spend their time at home is a useful indicator to determine if the healthcare system is achieving one of its primary goals. While this indicator provides a viewpoint broader than measures such as admissions or readmissions, the many different factors that can affect patients\u2019 \u201chealthy days at home\u201d raise serious concerns about whether differences in performance on this measure can be reliably attributed to the services delivered by ACOs and whether it would truly distinguish the quality of care ACO participants deliver. We also are concerned with the controlling high blood pressure measure in its current state, which determines performance based on a single reading rather than taking into account the level of control over a period of time. There are also limitations in accepting patient reported home readings that can be more reflective of true control of high blood pressure than office-based readings. Further, the MIPS Unplanned Admissions for Multiple Chronic Conditions measure does not meet the required 0.7 reliability threshold, and therefore we urge CMS to increase testing, particularly for risk adjustment, and increase case minimums for this measure before including it in the proposed APP measure set. Finally, the Unplanned Readmissions measure and CAHPS measures have very narrow bands, meaning very small differences in quality can result in very drastic quality score differences that are not meaningful and do not truly measure an ACO\u2019s quality improvement efforts. We recommend CMS work with stakeholders to make improvements to the specifications for these measures before using them as part of such a limited quality measure set as proposed in the APP. Finally, while we support the inclusion of patient satisfaction measures, we have concerns that the number of CAHPS measures included in the APP is disproportionate to clinical quality and outcomes measures. There are several issues with the CAHPS measures as currently collected. As an example, the CAHPS measures use a very small sampling of patients and rely on patient recollectio", "234": "CMS proposes to abruptly end the use of the Web Interface reporting mechanism, a tool that has been used since the MSSP\u2019s inception. Removing this option for all ACOs with little notice is ill-timed and unfair. Further, CMS has not been clear regarding how the alternative MIPS reporting options will be utilized for ACOs (as APM Entities) specifically. There are several key questions and obstacles to moving away from this reporting method in this timeframe. For example, the current remaining MIPS reporting options available under the APP would be registry (MIPS CQMs) and EHR (eCQMs). Using these reporting options would result in the ACO being evaluated on quality for all patients the ACO\u2019s providers serve, not only ACO assigned patients. This is not a true evaluation of the ACO\u2019s quality efforts and, additionally, raises contractual and legal concerns, as an ACO may not have the ability to access patient data for nonACO patients. This would also make quality evaluations challenging. In effect, assessing ACOs on their quality actions for all patients rather than ACO patients would be evaluating the ACO\u2019s spillover effects and would not directly evaluate the true impact of their work on their ACO patients. Further, a goal of APMs is to promote provider investment in processes and tools to improve outcomes. Many ACOs have invested significant resources for development of reporting processes and workflows to optimize this process; removing this option altogether would undermine these investments, thus diverting critical resources away from improving patient care. Additionally, making the switch to these alternative reporting options will cost many ACOs considerable time, money and effort in changing workflows, paying for registries and adapting and modifying EHRs to comply with eCQM standards. As an example, some ACOs would need to pay large fees for modifying EHRs to capture the appropriate quality data and to change performance dashboards. These fees can be significant, and a large hardship particularly for smaller ACOs. Other ACOs may need to explore working with registries, which again, could come with additional fees to the ACO. For these reasons, we urge CMS to provide a more gradual transition away from the use of the Web Interface reporting option to give more time and thought to how this will practically be implemented and to give ACOs more time to assess their alternatives. While CCHI supports the movement toward more automated reporting, the timeline CMS proposes is unreasonable and creates a hardship for ACOs. Specifically, we urge CMS to allow the Web Interface to be continued as an option for the foreseeable future while carefully considering additional reporting options for ACOs. Finally, moving to a registry or EHR-based reporting method will significantly increase the number of patients an ACO must report on and be evaluated on under CMS proposals. Currently, ACOs must report on 248 ACO patients included in the Web Interface. Under the registry option, an ACO would have to report on 60 percent of their patients, both Medicare and non-Medicare patients as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For the EHR reporting method, ACOs would be required to report on 70 percent of patients, both Medicare and non-Medicare as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For some ACOs this could be a drastic increase and will therefore add significant administrative burden for the ACO. Should CMS finalize this approach, the agency should be requiring the ACO to report on, at a maximum, 50 percent of exclusively ACO patients. These specification issues and differences demonstrate why CCHI feels an ACO-tailored approach to quality measurement and assessment is more appropriate than trying to make the MIPS program and standards apply to ACOs. This will be increasingly important as CCHI predicts many ACOs will not be able to meet the increasing QP thresholds in the coming years and will therefore find themselves subject to MIPS, even those taking", "235": "CCHI opposes the proposal to remove the pay-for-reporting year currently provided to ACOs beginning an initial MSSP contract, as well as individual measures that are newly introduced to the measure set. This change would also remove the ability of CMS to provide a pay-for-reporting year when measures undergo significant changes, such as guideline and specification changes. Providing the pay-for-reporting year is critical to an ACO\u2019s success. This flexibility in scoring when a measure undergoes significant changes allows an ACO to evaluate their current workflows, data capture processes and other operational strategies to see where changes are needed and what areas to focus on. Further, providing a newly introduced measure with a pay-for-reporting year ensures there are no unintended consequences or flaws in the measure specifications before holding an ACO accountable for performance on the measure. Allowing this time to assess workflows and operations before ACOs are held accountable for performance on measures allows ACOs to be successful in getting credit for the good quality improvement work they are already engaged in, as often times a measure is not only assessing true quality but also how the quality data are captured. We urge CMS to not finalize this approach and instead maintain the pay-for-reporting year provided to ACOs in their initial contract year, as well as new quality measures when they are introduced or significantly changed. The current MIPS policy would allow for suppression of a measure that undergoes significant specification changes: under the proposed new APP scoring approach this would significantly disadvantage ACOs who could see drastic swings in their performance based on suppression of just one measure. Additionally, CCHI opposes the overall approach proposed for ACO quality scoring. With upcoming changes to MIPS through the MIPS Value Pathways and exemptions due to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as for COVID19, the 40th percentile of the Quality Category score could vary greatly from year to year making it a less meaningful indicator of true performance. Instead, should CMS move forward with proposals to re-design the quality assessment structure for ACOs, we urge CMS to utilize a scoring approach that is more similar to the current domain-based scoring approach instead of using an all-or-nothing approach as proposed. As an example, CMS could instead consider a policy that would use a minimum attainment standard that requires 50 percent of the quality measures to meet or exceed the 40th percentile. This must be done in conjunction with our recommendations to add additional clinical quality measures to the measure set beyond the three that CMS has currently proposed. Setting the standard at 50 percent ensures that ACOs perform well on a substantial set of measures to earn savings but does not punish ACOs that miss the mark on a measure that is either not as relevant to their patient population or has a very narrow range of performance rates. Finally, CCHI also urges CMS to better reward high quality performers, as is done in the Medicare Advantage program by providing bonuses or higher shared savings rates to high quality performers or those that notably improve quality scores over time.", "236": "Proposals: CMS seeks comment on an alternative approach that ACOs could use in the event \u201cthe three measures ACOs are required to actively report on are not applicable to their beneficiary population.\u201d In this case, the ACO could choose to opt out of the APP and report to MIPS as an APM Entity selecting more appropriate measures available under MIPS. CMS does not include any further details regarding how CMS would determine if the three required measures were not applicable to the ACO. Comments: CCHI opposes this approach to provide ACOs the option of selecting alternative quality measures to report. First, we cannot contemplate instances when the proposed APP measures listed would be determined to not apply to an ACO. Second, allowing this option would make program evaluation nearly impossible. Evaluating ACO\u2019s impact on quality should be a key focus for CMS and, therefore, there should be one standard set of quality measures that apply to all ACOs participating in the model. Finally, CCHI has concerns that this policy would allow certain organizations to select measures for which they have the highest historical performance, not allowing for a true and fair assessment of quality improvement efforts across ACOs.", "237": "CCHI is pleased to see CMS providing a fallback option for 2020 quality scores due to the impact of COVID19. While CCHI prefers to see all measures reverted to pay-for-reporting in 2020, we support this alternative approach that will protect ACOs whose quality scores are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also pleased to see CMS remove the requirement for ACOs to field a CAHPS for ACOs survey in 2020 and provide full points automatically for each of the CAHPS survey measures. We urge CMS to finalize these proposals.

We appreciate CMS\u2019s efforts to minimize burdens associated with the repayment mechanism. Currently, a renewing ACO that wants to use its existing repayment mechanism in the subsequent agreement period is required to maintain a higher repayment mechanism amount than necessary for its new agreement period if the repayment mechanism amount for the last performance year of the previous agreement period is greater than what is needed for the subsequent agreement period. We support CMS\u2019s proposal to eliminate this requirement and recommend it be finalized. Under the Pathways to Success regulations when a recalculated repayment mechanism increases by a certain amount (i.e., the lesser of 50 percent or $1,000,000), CMS requires the ACO to increase the value of the repayment mechanism. However, CMS does not currently decrease the repayment mechanism amount when the opposite occurs, a policy for which CCHI has advocated and which the agency proposes to change in this rule. We appreciate CMS\u2019s proposal to allow ACOs an option to decrease their repayment mechanism amount if the recalculated amount is less than the current amount, and we request the agency finalize this policy. We also support CMS providing an opportunity for ACOs that renewed their agreements effective in 2019 or 2020 an opportunity to benefit from this policy change, if finalized, by adjusting their repayment mechanism amounts already in place, if they quality under the revised policy. We support CMS\u2019s proposals in the rule, but we also urge the agency to take additional steps to minimize burdens associated with repayment mechanism requirements. Many ACOs cite the burden and cost of securing a repayment mechanism as reasons not to move to a risk-based ACO model. Instead of requiring a repayment mechanism that pays banks and brokers and takes money away from the ACO executing its core mission of improving patient care, we urge CMS to remove the repayment mechanism requirement when an ACO can prove that it has an investor or financial backer with a demonstrated high credit rating. Financial backers could include outside investors, insurers or hospitals or health systems that are involved with the ACO and providing financial support, which would be available should losses occur. This assurance would protect the Medicare Trust Fund in the event the ACO has losses while avoiding the financial inefficiency and regulatory burden of involving outside financial institutions as third parties that benefit from the repayment mechanism requirements. This would also eliminate the need to have a 24-month tail period. The additional burden of a 24-month \u201ctail period\u201d heightens concerns and increases financial requirements for ACOs. Should CMS maintain requirements for a repayment mechanism, we request the agency to minimize this regulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for tail period coverage, which is especially important considering the longer agreement periods.", "242": "Proposals: CMS clarifies that to align Track 1+ policies with MSSP policies, the agency is providing Track 1+ ACOs whose agreement periods are set to expire December 31, 2020, an opportunity to voluntarily extend their agreement period for a fourth performance year in 2021. Additionally, CMS clarifies that the proposed MSSP policies in this rule would apply to Track 1+ ACOs in the same way they apply to Track 1 ACOs as long as the applicable regulation has not been waived under the Track 1+ Model. Comments: We thank CMS for taking action to provide more flexibility to ACOs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We strongly support the option provided to ACOs with agreements ending December 31, 2020, to extend their agreements for an additional performance year and appreciate the agency clarifying that this policy also applies to Track 1+ ACOs. This will provide much needed stability for ACOs in an uncertain time.", "243": "CCHI supports updating the definition of primary care codes used for MSSP assignment. Assignment is a critical program methodology that determines the beneficiary population for which an ACO is held accountable. Adding codes such as \u201ce-visits,\u201d chronic care management, and principal care management will help create a better picture of where patients receive most of their primary care. CMS should continue to refine the primary care codes used in assignment, and we request that the agency do so in a timely manner. We recommend CMS finalize adding the nine proposed codes to the MSSP assignment methodology. CCHI also appreciates CMS\u2019s desire to ensure that patients are attributed to providers from whom they receive their primary care services. Therefore, we support excluding advance care planning services from MSSP assignment when billed in an inpatient setting and also excluding professional services furnished by FQHCs or RHCs when delivered in a SNF. Both of these changes, while technical in nature, help create more complete and accurate patient assignment lists for ACOs and we recommend the agency finalize these proposals. While CCHI appreciates CMS\u2019s work to refine assignment during the COVID-19 PHE, CCHI recommends that CMS use a two-year assignment window for MSSP to account for potential variations in attribution in 2020 and 2021. Especially in states hit harder by the pandemic, healthy patients may forego routine primary care and throw off assignment for MSSP ACOs who use either retrospective or prospective attribution. Therefore, patient visits from 2019 and 2020 should be considered for ACOs\u2019 assignment lists regardless if ACOs choose prospective attribution or retrospective attribution. While the windows for either groups of ACOs will be different, the same general principle applies and would help create more steady and accurate assignment lists. The Next Generation ACO Model uses a two-year assignment window already.", "244": "Quality Category: CMS Web Interface (CWI) Removal: We do not support removal of the CMS Web Interface collection and submission type in 2021 performance year/2023 payment year. We request the removal be postponed due to effects from the COVID19 pandemic and significant hardships. First, the COVID19 pandemic has significantly reduced revenue and forced furloughs and reduced the number of staff in organizations. The effects of and Page 4 of 9 recovery from the revenue reduction will continue over the next several years. Removal of CMS Web Interface will increase costs for organizations during this delicate time. A switch to MIPS CQMs and eCQMs in a short time period will require contracts with third party vendors at a significant cost to the organization. As opposed to CWI reporting, which was performed in-house without third party vendors and minimal additional cost to our organization. Second, as an academic medical system, our budgets are complete as our fiscal year is July to June. The cost increase was not included in the budget and may lead to higher reductions in revenue. The switch to other collection and submission types are very costly and not included in lean budgets. Third, the short timeframe to change collection and submission types will not allow for identification and implementation of changes to workflows. For instance, our current electronic medical record does not include billing information. For eCQMs, billing information is a vital component for accurate reporting of quality measures. For MIPS CQMs, data within the electronic medical record may be in locations beneficial to CWI reporting, but not for MIPS CQM reporting. Changes to locations of data require workflow changes for clinicians and other staff. If CWI is removed, it is improbable to make these changes in a few months. Fourth, personnel have been relocated to telehealth and other staff deployed home, thus there are less on-site resources for changes needed to implement a change to collection and submission types. Fifth, we will experience a drop in measure performance by the quick switch in collection types allowing for no opportunity for improvements in workflows and change in clinician documentation. For instance, the Preventive Care and Screening: Screening for Depression and Follow-Up Plan change to eCQM collection type would result in a 40% drop in performance, if reported today without any changes to documentation or system.", "245": "MIPS APMs: APP reporting: We would like more clarification on APMs and their associated MIPS eligible clinicians prior to finalizing the APP.

We believe this requirement is achievable since the benchmarks are released early enough during the performance year, helping an ACO set goals throughout the year. In addition, there are enough measures in each domain to allow ACOs to meet the 30th percentile in at least one measure per domain. We believe that the proposal to increase the minimum threshold from the 30th to the 40th percentile sets too high of a bar, especially if the 2021 benchmarks are not being released until after the 2021 performance year and the number of measures is reduce to six for 2021. We ask CMS to revisit the 40th percentile proposal and keep this at the 30th percentile for 2021. In addition, we ask CMS to consider allowing some or all measures to be pay-for-reporting for the 2021 performance year due to the current public health emergency.

We strongly believe that the Web Interface reporting mechanism should still be considered an option to report quality in 2021 and onwards. In addition, there is very little time for ACOs to adapt to the new reporting requirements for the 2021 performance year if the final rule is expected towards the end of this year.

Our hospitals are already experiencing slight upticks in COVID\nrelated volume. This would significantly narrow the window of opportunity to deliver routine\ncare especially to those over 65 with high risk conditions. Many patients only feel safe by\navoiding interacting with the health care system. For the remainder of 2020, hospitals, group\npractices, and individual providers will be focused on urgent or emergent patients, as well as\nprotecting themselves, their staff, and other patients from the coronavirus. While CMS has\nexpanded telehealth coverage for Medicare ACOs, many quality measures cannot be properly\nmet in a remote setting (e.g., immunizations, mammography). Due to uncontrollable\ncircumstances, ACO quality performance should be measured on a Pay-For-Reporting basis\nfor PY2020. Please see the quality measure grid on last page for more detail.\nIf CMS does include any Pay-for Performance measures for PY 2020, then Steward\nrecommends that all 2020 MSSPs should receive for each measure the higher of the 2019\nmean quality score across all 2019 ACOs, the ACO\u2019s 2019 actual performance or the ACO\u2019s\nactual measure performance for performance year 2020.

By taking the 2019 national mean for measures in Domains 2, 3, and 4,\nit will significantly reduce the adverse impact of COVID-19 and mitigate the disproportional\nimpact different ACOs experience depending on the state(s) the majority of their ACO\nmembers reside in. For example, ACOs with a large rural population already have advanced\ntelehealth and remote patient monitoring capabilities and are better equipped to manage\npatients during a global pandemic. However, ACOs with patients predominantly located in\nurban service areas have lesser developed telehealth functionality.", "274": "PY 2021: CMS should not reduce the number of measures nor raise the minimum\npercentile requirements for ACOs to share in savings.\nWe recommend CMS leave the regulation as it is currently, where ACOs must completely and\naccurately report all measures and achieve at, or above, the 30th percentile on one measure in\neach domain to be eligible to share in savings.\nHolding providers accountable for a wide range of measures leads to broader quality\nimprovement for more patients with varying conditions. A significant cut to the number of\nmeasures could potentially lead to reduced efforts from providers, a spike in inpatient\nadmissions and utilization, and most importantly, an overall decrease in patient quality of care.\nAdditionally, CMS should not implement a performance floor during a transitional year:\nPerformance benchmarks will change to MIPS program benchmarks, which are calculated on\nhistorical MIPS data, from ACO program benchmarks. Based on the disruption that COVID-\n19 has caused to 2019 reporting, and is anticipated for 2020, CMS expects to release the\nbenchmarks retrospectively (after performance rates have been calculated). Because of this,\nthe proposed rule essentially requires ACOs to achieve the 40th percentile without knowing\nwhat that benchmark will be in advance of the performance period.By increasing the minimum quality thresholds from the 30th to 40th percentile for all measures,\nCMS is jeopardizing ACOs\u2019 ability to share in savings which directly threatens long-term\nsustainability of Medicare ACO programs going forward. Using the latest 2019 MSSP\npublicly available data, approximately 300 ACOs (55%) would have been ineligible to share in\nsavings if the proposed 40th percentile minimum threshold rule was in place during that time\nfor the proposed five measure set, excluding the CAHPS survey measure. Of those 300\nACOs, 148 earned shared savings in PY2019 totaling approximately $650 million in shared\nsavings that would have been forfeited. Medicare ACO programs can be very costly to\noperationalize, and with an increased chance of earning zero shared savings, this proposal has\nunintended consequences mainly leading to reduced ACO participation.", "275": "PY 2021: CMS should continue using the quality reporting web interface system and\nshould not switch to MIPS reporting.\nUnder the proposed rule, ACOs would have to use an entirely new data source to report\nperformance. Electronic EMR data would be submitted and the data would be all-payer data\nnot just the managed fee-for-service Medicare population. This proposal would put come at a\nsignificant cost, especially for ACOs who do not use a single EMR. ACOs would need more\ntime than the rule contemplates to determine whether the EMR functionality at each practice\nthroughout their network is robust enough to support all-payer performance for each provider.\nSteward has made significant investments in centralizing our Medicare ACO data and\nreporting in one consolidated Data Warehouse that supports coordination of care across the\ncontinuum of care. Centralization allows an ACO to integrate data from a wide array of data\nsources \u2013 including claims, clinical records, patient experience, community services, care\nmanagement and ancillary services \u2013 that can be used to match patients to ACO resources as\nwell as reduce waste and overutilization to achieve improved access, cost, and quality goals.\nThis centralization also supports complete and accurate reporting at the ACO-level.\nDecentralizing quality reporting to reflect the current APM EMR-level reporting will\nundermine the established infrastructure and result in underreporting of quality performance.\nLastly but importantly, this proposal would not leave ample time for ACOs to retain a vendor\nto complete this reporting, putting the ACO in jeopardy of earning savings regardless of actual\nquality and cost performance.", "276": "There are multiple concerns with the proposed ACO quality changes.

[...] Secondly, drastically reducing the number of quality measures from 23 to six de-emphasizes quality and will create a performance standard that may not be truly representative of an ACO's actual quality improvement efforts. Thirdly, abruptly removing the Web Interface as a reporting mechanism will have a big impact on ACOs' ability to get credit for their true quality efforts. CMS should continue to offer the Web Interface as an option and over time allow additional reporting options to those ACOs who would be ready to implement, such as registry or Electronic Health Record (EHR) reporting. Additionally, moving to the alternative reporting options CMS has provided through the proposed APM Performance Pathway (APP) would cause many ACOs to have to pay for registries and/or EHR upgrades and dashboards to capture the correct data to be able to report to CMS. Finally, there are remaining questions regarding how the ACO would report the data for non-Medicare and non-ACO patient data, which is required when reporting using a registry or EHR. This could cause ACOs to have to revisit contracts and could raise legal concerns as the ACO does not typically have access to non-ACO patient data.\n\nFinally, we also have deep concerns with CMS's proposal to remove the pay-for-reporting year currently provided to first time ACOs as well as quality measures that are newly introduced or undergo significant changes. ACOs use the pay-for-reporting year as a time to get the correct processes and performance dashboards in place to be able to be successful in their quality improvement efforts. These are critical and removing them while still holding ACOs accountable for new quality measures, as an example, is unfair and will cause ACOs to hesitate to enter the program.\n\nACOs are committed to providing high quality care to our patients and quality improvement is at the core of what we do. Making these sweeping changes at this challenging time will disadvantage my ACO and we urge CMS to not finalize these proposed ACO quality policies.\n\nSpecifically our ACO will suffer from ending the Web Interface as a reporting option because our providers operate on two different EHRs. While both of these EHRs are leading EHR systems (Athena and NextGen), they present significant hurdles to proper reporting. Removing the Web Interface reporting options puts our ability to provide accurate reporting in the hands of the EHR companies' that may not have all of their reporting features fully functional and does not allow for manual correction. While these EHRs continue to be updated and strive to meet the ever-changing requirements for reporting, they lag in accuracy and efficiency. It is imperative that we continue to have the ability to make manual corrections on the Web Interface reporting portal. Also, making these abrupt changes in the reporting measures, metrics and methods places an undue burden on our ACO staff (providers and support staff) in a time when we are struggling in the midst of this pandemic to just maintain healthy staff, working long hours and dealing with ever changing patient needs and PHE protocols. We need more time to be able to incorporate new changes.

Comment: We support decreasing the total number of measures an ACO is required to report on each year. This change decreases the reporting burden placed on rural primary care practices. While we support the inclusion of patient satisfaction measures, we have concerns that the number of CAHPS measures included in the APP is disproportionate to clinical quality and outcomes measures. There are several issues with the CAHPS measures as currently collected. As an example, the CAHPS measures use a very small sampling of patients and rely on patient recollection of experience that took place months prior. CMS should consider altering surveys to accept results from shorter surveys provided closer to real time and to a much larger population. We also support all quality measures allow data collected during telehealth visits, starting with PY2020. Many ACO participants relied on telehealth visits to continue seeing their patients. This reliance lasted most of PY2020 and may increase during the final months of PY2020. Quality measure specifications must recognize this unique reliance on telehealth visits during a PHE.", "282": "Removing the Web Interface Reporting Mechanism Proposals: CMS proposes to eliminate the Web Interface as a reporting method for ACOs and all MIPS reporters beginning in 2021, citing low uptake of use outside the ACO program. In place of the Web Interface, the APP would require ACOs to actively report on three clinical quality measures, which could be reported using a registry or direct via electronic health records (EHRs) using electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) standards. These eCQMs must be reported for all patients, regardless of payer. Comments: CMS proposes to abruptly end the use of the Web Interface reporting mechanism, a tool that has been used since the MSSP's inception. Removing this option for all ACOs with little notice is ill-timed and unfair. We agree with NAACOS' views on moving to a registry or EHR-based reporting method. Moving to a registry or EHR-based reporting method will significantly increase the number of patients an ACO must report on and be evaluated on under CMS proposals. Currently, ACOs must report on 248 ACO patients included in the Web Interface. Under the registry option, an ACO would have to report on 60 percent of their patients, both Medicare and non-Medicare patients as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For the EHR reporting method, ACOs would be required to report on 70 percent of patients, both Medicare and non-Medicare as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For some ACOs this could be a drastic increase and will therefore add significant administrative burden for the ACO. Should CMS finalize this approach, the agency should be requiring the ACO to report on, at a maximum, 50 percent of exclusively ACO patients.

These measures should not be unduly burdensome for providers, and they should generally be calculated or administered by CMS, preferably with data that are already reported, such as claims, encounters, and patient survey data. These principles informed our recommended redesigns of Medicare\u2019s acute-care hospital and Medicare Advantage quality programs. Moreover, we are supportive of monitoring and possibly further refinement as more data and analysis becomes available.", "299": "ACP strongly opposes CMS\u2019 proposal to eliminate the pay-for-reporting phase-in\nperiod for new measures.

Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP)\n\nQuality Reporting and Scoring\n\nCMS Proposal: As noted earlier, MSSP ACOs would be required to report through the APP for purposes\nof assessing both their quality performance within the program, as well as MIPS. Quality scores would\nbe calculated based on MIPS benchmarks, as opposed to MSSP specific benchmarks. Scoring caps for\n\u201ctopped out\u201d measures would not apply, though those measures may be removed in future\nperformance years. Web Interface would be removed as a reporting option, so MSSP ACOs would select\none of the other available mechanisms to report quality data. Under the new APP, all MSSP ACOs would\nbe scored on six static quality measures (instead of 23) and actively report three measures (instead of\n10). The CAHPS for MIPS survey, which currently counts as 10 separate measures and comprises 25\npercent of the MSSP quality score, would count as one measure.\nACP Comments: In general, ACP appreciates the spirit of this proposal to streamline quality reporting\nand minimize burden on MSSP ACOs. We also support a number of the individual proposals. However,\nwe do have concerns with some proposals about several potential unintended consequences.\n\nMost acutely, we are concerned about the proposed implementation timeline, particularly given the\ndelayed release of the final rule and the COVID-19 PHE. ACP urges CMS to delay any proposed MSSP\nquality reporting changes until the 2022 performance year, particularly removing Web Interface as an\navailable reporting option. MSSP ACOs have been reporting via web interface since the program\u2019s start.\nMany may have limited familiarity with other reporting options. Moreover, many ACOs are complex\nnetworks of different practices, hospitals, and health systems. It will take time to evaluate alternative\noptions, sign a new vendor contract, and implement a coordinated roll out across all of these entities.\nLess than 60 days\u2019 notice is an insufficient window of time to implement these changes successfully,\nespecially during a global pandemic. Additionally, Web Interface requires reporting on a sample of the\nfirst 248 consecutively assigned patients. The majority of other reporting methods require reporting on\n60-70 percent of all eligible patients across payers, which would represent a massive increase in\nreporting burden, which again, comes at a particularly inopportune time with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis would mean ACOs would have to collect this data from each of its participating TINs, which would\nlikely entail transitioning them all to the same EHR, QCDR, or qualified registry platform \u2013 a potential\nlogistical nightmare with untold rippling effects on expense and reporting disruption that may force\npractices to re-evaluate their participation in the ACO. Removing the Web Interface reporting option\nand finalizing the other MSSP quality reporting changes within the proposed timeframe risks possible\nwide-scale quality reporting disruptions for MSSP ACOs.", "302": "We are also concerned about potential implications that evaluating MSSP ACOs on MIPS benchmarks\nwould have both for ACOs and other MIPS eligible clinicians, which is exacerbated by the fact that Web\nInterface would no longer be an available reporting option. Currently, all ACOs are required to report via\nWeb Interface and are scored on identical performance benchmarks, whereas MIPS quality measure\nbenchmarks are based on the reporting modality and can vary widely, even for the same measure. ACOs\nare large, sophisticated, and complex systems with unique attributes that distinguish them from\nindividual clinicians or group practices. Including them in benchmarks calculations for other MIPS\nreporting modalities may drastically alter benchmarks for other MIPS eligible clinicians and further\nexacerbate the performance gap between small practices and larger health systems. At the very least,\nfor a change of this magnitude, the Agency should provide more data, ideally modeling past\nperformance data that compares how benchmarks under the proposed new methodology would\ncompare to the current methodology, both for MSSP ACOs and general MIPS benchmarks. CMS should\nalso give stakeholders time to evaluate this information, consider the full impact of these proposals, and\nprovide more detailed feedback. At this time, we urge CMS to reverse its proposal to align MSSP\nquality benchmarks with MIPS benchmarks", "303": "As noted in the APP section, ACP has concerns about the inflexibility of CMS\u2019 proposal to require all\nclinicians reporting under the APP to report the same six quality measures. While ACP greatly\nappreciates CMS being responsive to stakeholder calls to reduce reporting burden, we worry that\nreducing the MSSP quality measures set from 23 to six measures in one performance year is a drastic\nchange with an unforeseeable impact on quality scoring for ACOs. It also omits entire categories of\nquality assessment that help to drive positive patient outcomes, such as vaccinations or cancer\nscreenings. The College suggests a more gradual, phased reduction in which CMS would remove\nmeasures in rounds based on level of priority and evaluate the impact before proceeding with\nremoving additional measures", "304": "ACP also has technical concerns with the six specific measures proposed, as explained in our comments\non the APP.

Under the APP, measures that fail to\nmeet specified patient population or minimum case thresholds would not be counted.\nACP Comments: ACP does not support all-or-nothing approaches to quality scoring and supports CMS\u2019\nproposal to no longer automatically give ACOs zero points for the entire Quality Category if they fail to\nreport a single required measure. We feel that awarding zero points for failure to report applicable,\nrequired measures is an appropriate compromise. We also support CMS\u2019 proposal not to count\nmeasures that fail to meet patient population or case minimum requirements.

In addition to terminating an ACO\u2019s participation agreement if it\nfails to meet the quality performance standard for any two consecutive years, CMS proposes that it may\nalso do so if an ACO fails to meet the quality performance standard for any three years within the same\nfive-year agreement period. This new policy would also apply to \u201cre-entering ACOs,\u201d e.g. 50 percent or\nmore of the participants were in the same ACO within a five-year lookback period.\nACP Comments: ACP strongly opposes CMS\u2019 proposal to eliminate the pay-for-reporting phase-in\nperiod for new measures. This period is critical to allow ACOs time to familiarize themselves with new\nmeasures and for CMS to study the impact and make potential adjustments before using these\nmeasures to impact physician payments to help avoid potential adverse consequences. The impact and\nimportance of this would be magnified if CMS does reduce the quality measure set in the future. While \n\nACP supports rigorous quality standards to ensure patients are receiving the best possible care, we do\nnot think it is advisable for CMS to increase minimum quality standards during a global health crisis. We\nurge CMS to delay any changes to minimum scoring standards until at least 2022, possibly longer, as\nthe COVID-19 PHE crisis evolves.", "307": "All-Cause Unplanned Admissions for Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions Measure\nCMS Proposal: CMS would use the revised All-Cause Unplanned Admissions for Patients with Multiple\nChronic Conditions measure, which uses slightly revised measure specifications to align the ACO MCC\nmeasure with the MIPS MCC measure by: (1) adding a diabetes cohort; (2) excluding any admissions\nwithin 10 days of discharge from a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or acute rehabilitation facility; and (3)\nadjusting for the AHRQ socioeconomic status index and specialist density social risk factors.\nACP Comments: ACP\u2019s PMC has not yet reviewed the all-cause readmission for patients with multiple\nchronic conditions measure. However, we generally support measuring outcomes for patients with\nmultiple chronic conditions at the group practice level or higher and also support the specific\nmethodological changes proposed, particularly incorporating additional risk factors related to\nsocioeconomic status and social risk factors, which has been a top advocacy priority of ACP\u2019s for many\nyears.", "308": "Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Policy\nCMS Proposal: CMS proposes to adjust the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy so that it\nwould apply the higher of the affected ACO\u2019s quality score or the 40th percentile MIPS Quality score, as\nopposed to the mean ACO score. CMS solicits feedback on alternatives that would continue to\nincentivize reporting, such as adjusting savings similar to losses by multiplying the maximum possible\nsavings by the percentage of total months and beneficiaries affected.\nACP Comments: While ACP appreciates CMS\u2019 goal to incentivize reporting, ACP strongly opposes CMS\u2019\nchanges to the MSSP extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy as proposed, which would\neffectively lower the protections for impacted ACOs and comes at a particularly tumultuous time with\nCOVID-19. ACP would support a similar policy that would apply the higher of either score, provided\nthe Agency maintains the same baseline level of protection, i.e. the mean ACO score. This would\nmaintain current levels of protection, which is particularly critical during the midst of a global pandemic,\nwhile incentivizing ACOs to report data to improve their quality scores", "309": "Adding to Covered Primary Care Services List used for Patient Assignment\nCMS Proposal: CMS proposes to add several services to the list of primary care services for patient\nassignment and for other purposes. These include online digital E/M services i.e. \u201ce-visits,\u201d assessment\nof and care planning for patients with cognitive impairment, chronic care management (CCM) services,\nnon-complex CCM services, principal care management services, and psychiatric collaborative care\nmodel codes (if finalized). CMS also proposes to exclude advance care planning services when billed in\nan inpatient care setting because it may attribute beneficiaries based on inpatient care rather than their\nregular primary care clinician.\nACP Comments: ACP generally supports the addition of these codes to the list of primary care services,\nincluding telehealth services. We agree adding these codes will help to improve the accuracy of patient \nattribution. We also agree with CMS\u2019 proposal to exclude inpatient advance care planning services to\nreinforce the relationship between a patient and his/her regular primary care clinician.", "310": "Repayment Mechanism Flexibilities\nCMS Proposal: For renewing ACOs that wish to use their existing repayment mechanism for a new\nagreement period, CMS proposes to discontinue the policy that currently requires them to maintain\nexisting repayment mechanism amounts if higher than the amount specified for the new agreement\nperiod. Starting with the 2022 application cycle, such ACOs would only be required to meet the\nremaining criterion, i.e. an amount equal to: (1) one percent of total per capita Medicare Parts A and B\nFFS expenditures for the ACO's assigned beneficiaries for the most recent calendar year; or (2) two\npercent of total Medicare Parts A and B FFS revenue of its ACO participants for the most recent calendar\nyear, whichever is less. Renewing ACOs could still choose to switch repayment mechanisms for the new\nagreement period. In these cases, the ACO would maintain its existing repayment mechanism at the\npreviously required amount until it is able to terminate the first repayment mechanism, after which only\nthe new mechanism for the ACO\u2019s current agreement period would remain. CMS is considering finalizing\nan additional policy that would require renewing ACOs to maintain existing, higher repayment\nmechanism amounts until they have fully repaid any shared losses owed for the most recent\nperformance year. CMS is also considering finalizing provisions that would specify \u201cre-entering ACOs\u201d as\nthe same legal entity as an ACO that previously participated in the program, and may therefore use that\nACO\u2019s existing repayment mechanism to support its participation in a new agreement period in the\nMSSP. CMS proposes to allow ACOs whose agreement periods began July 1, 2019 or Jan. 1, 2020 a onetime opportunity to elect to reduce the amount of their repayment mechanisms if they elected to use\nan existing repayment mechanism, the original amount was greater than the new amount, and the\nrecalculated amount for performance year 2021 is less than the existing repayment mechanism amount.\nIf finalized, CMS will notify applicable ACOs of this opportunity to reduce their repayment mechanism\namounts after the start of the 2021 performance year. Interested ACOs would submit such an election,\ntogether with revised repayment mechanism documentation, in a form and manner and by a deadline\nspecified by CMS, likely within 30 days from the date of the written notice from CMS.\nACP Comments: ACP supports CMS\u2019 proposals to institute new repayment mechanism flexibilities. We\nagree that other enforcement mechanisms, such as possible pre-termination actions and accruing\ninterest for not repaying shared losses, are sufficient to warrant timely repayment of shared losses. We\ngenerally support these policies as proposed, including the provision that would allow re-entering ACOs\nto use the original ACO\u2019s existing repayment mechanism. However, we urge CMS to consider allowing\n2019 and 2020 ACOs longer than 30 days to submit elections to reduce their repayment mechanism\namounts, particularly given the circumstances of COVID-19.", "311": "Proposal to replace Web Interface reporting with APP\n\nCMS should NOT replace the Web Interface reporting option for ACOs or MIPS groups with\nthe APP set until--AT MINIMUM--2022. If APP data is expected to be captured beginning\n1/1/21, there is NOT ENOUGH TIME between September 2020 and January 2021 for groups\nto completely overhaul and rebuild the platforms needed to switch data queries from a Web\nInterface source to eCQMs or MIPS CQM sources.\n\nFor MIPS, the minimum requirement is 6 new Quality measures (new because they will have\nto be completely rebuilt according to eCQMs or MIPS CQM specs). Our estimation of time \nand resources to rebuild 1 measure is 60+ hours, via a resource combination of information\ndevelopers, ambulatory workflow experts, physicians, nurses, data validators, project\nmanagers and analytics. For 6 measures, that is a 360 hour minimum commitment\u2014which\nwill not be able to be accommodated in a little over 3 months, given the types of resources\nneeded for execution to be successful.\n\nInstead, if CMS is intent on pursuing the APP reporting method, 2022 should be the earliest\ntimeframe for it to begin. In addition, CMS should confirm via the CY 2021 Final Rule which\nexact measures will begin in 2022, so groups have enough time to build and validate these\nmeasures beforehand.\n\nFinally, CMS should not restrict the APP to only 3 clinical quality measures. While we\nappreciate CMS\u2019 efforts to reduce the overall administrative burden of building, updating\nand submitting clinical quality data, restricting the total set to only 3 outcome measures\ndoes not fairly depict ACOs\u2019 efforts toward maintaining excellent patient care.

COVID-19 in\n2020 has caused unprecedented havoc in terms of capturing clinical information necessary\nfor the quality metrics CMS has assigned to ACOs. Example\u2014for both the DM A1C and\nHTN measures, CMS does not allow any patient-reported data to count towards the\nnumerator. How can this possibly work in a pandemic era when most patients forgo visits\ninvolving physical interaction?\n\nTherefore, it is not reasonable to expect ACOs to be able to accurately report quality\nmeasure information when the base infrastructure to collect that information has\ncompletely changed due to a pandemic. Instead, CMS should either: (1) use the higher of\nthe 2019 or 2020 scores; or (2) make all 2020 measures pay-for-reporting (except for\nCAHPS, which is already slated to halt for 2020).", "313": "Proposal to add visit codes for ACO beneficiary assignment\n\nWe fully support CMS\u2019 decision to include new primary care centric codes to the applicable\nlist used for ACO beneficiary assignment.

It is vital that ACOs are held responsible for\nthe correct cohort of patients, and these changes help to \u2018move the needle\u2019 in that\ndirection.

We respectfully request the ability\nto report and track by both Web Interface and the new APP to allow for development and to become accustomed to the\nmeasure definitions and performance. As I am sure you are aware, depending on the method of submission, the quality\nmeasure specifications vary. There is concern that the Web Interface measure definition currently allows for more\nmeasures to be met via telehealth while eCQMs are less flexible. We ask that the eCQM measure specifications align\nwith the Web Interface measures and allow for measures to be less reliant on face to face office visits.", "315": "Regarding benchmarking, we are concerned about the proposed method to use current year performance for\nbenchmarking. The inability to have defined targets can prohibit the needed positive improvement in measure\nperformance. We may believe we are doing well but be off the mark on an ambiguous, unknown target. We request that\nCMS define the benchmarks prior to the performance year using known data based on previous year(s) performance.\nWe appreciate the efforts from CMS to formulate updated claims-based measures, however, are again concerned with\nperformance expectations.

The APP would apply one set of quality measures for all APMs subject\nto MIPS, requiring each model participant to report both their APM\u2019s specific quality measures\nand the APP quality measures as well. We appreciate and endorse moving to one quality\nstandard for all APMs. However, at this time, it is our view that this one size fits all approach\nrepresents an additional burden for APM participants due to the national public health\nemergency.

Open stakeholder forums, requests for information, or other venues such as the\nMeasure Applications Partnership (MAP) are all viable venues for feedback that will ensure a\nmore accurate set of measures.

We have numerous concerns over the\nremoval of this reporting option which is heavily preferred by Medicare Shared Savings (MSSP)\nand Next Generation ACOs, with so little notice. We would request that CMS provider greater\nclarity on the expected use of alternative MIPS reporting options, such as MIPS CQMs and\neCQMs. The use of these reporting mechanisms could result of inaccurate evaluation of ACOs\nquality performance based on the total patient population instead of patients assigned to an  ACO as the rule intended. In addition to wrongful attribution, ACOs may have issues with\naccessing patient data for those patients not assigned to them, skewing any assessment of\nquality.\n\nIn light of the required investments for ACOs transitioning to comply with eCQM standards, we\nask that CMS adopt a more phased-in approach that moves quality reporting away from the\nuse of the Web Interface reporting option toward any proposed alternatives.

While the proposal surrounding maximum savings\nafter achieving a quality threshold is positive overall, we have concerns regarding the increase\nfrom the 30th percentile of the one measure in each domain to 40th minimum percentile in\naggregate in quality performance. While comparing ACOs to all MIPS performers may seem\nreasonable on the surface, our members are very concerned about the all or nothing (cliff\napproach) that could have major implications to sustainable of the model.

Through patient\nattribution, responsibility for the quality and costs of the care delivered to that patient for a\nspecific performance period and under value-based contracts, the patient attribution process\ndefines a provider\u2019s risk pool, influences medical loss ratio, and determines whether a provider\nwill realize shared savings or losses and how those funds or penalties are allocated. As patients\nseek telehealth services from providers at their own convenience, the potential for care to be\ngiven to patients by providers who specialize exclusively in telehealth and do not have an\nongoing longitudinal relationship with a primary care physician is high. As a result, these\ntelehealth-only providers could possibly conduct services such as virtual annual wellness visits\nthat would not be properly attributed and disrupt the continuum of care and attribution data as\na result.

Reg. 50230): CMS proposes to require the new APP measure set for all\nMSSP ACO participants; the APP would evaluate ACOs on three clinical measures, one measure\nbased on CAHPS scores, and two new administrative claims measures. The agency would also apply\nthe APP for purposes of QPP reporting requirements starting with the 2021 performance period.\n\nMGMA comment: MGMA does not support moving MSSP ACOs to the APP measure set\nbeginning in 2021. In general, we support reducing reporting burden but have concerns about\nreducing the number of clinical quality measures to just three. We believe further consideration must\nbe afforded as to whether the proposed balance of measures is appropriate (e.g., proportion of\nclinical, patient experience, and administrative claims measures).\nACOs should be evaluated on quality measures that reflect core competencies of the ACO, such as\ncare coordination activities and preventative health. The proposed measure set reduces clinical\nmeasures to three. While we support efforts to reduce reporting burden, we respectfully request that\nthe agency take more time to carefully consider measure selection, determine the appropriate clinical\nmeasure set, and proportion of measure types. We generally agree the three clinical measures\nproposed by CMS reflect important clinical priority areas that ACOs should focus on but are\nconcerned that reducing these measures to three allows little room for random variation in one\nmeasure.\nIn addition to changes to the clinical measure set, proposed changes to quality reporting would\nstreamline CAHPS scores into one measure. MGMA agrees that patient experience data is critically\nimportant, but CMS does not clearly detail how it would create one composite CAHPS measure\nscore. Further, CAHPS measures have narrow bands, which means that minor differences in results\ncan cause significant variation in scores. We generally have concerns around using administrative\nclaims measures and encourage the agency to engage in further testing for risk adjustment, which\nshould include social risk factors. CMS has not produced comprehensive measure specifications,\nwhich raises concerns about the ability of ACOs to understand how they will be measured and how\nto implement measures in practice. This potential for unpredictability, coupled with variance due to\nrisk adjustment changes in the two administrative measures, creates significant uncertainty regarding\nquality scores since the CAHPS measure and two administrative claims measures would account for\nhalf of an ACO\u2019s quality score.\nFor these reasons, we recommend CMS postpone any major transition and utilize this time to consult\nwith the ACO community to determine a balanced measure set.", "330": "MSSP: Removing Web Interface\nCMS proposal (85 Fed. Reg. 50230): CMS proposes to remove the Web Interface reporting\nmechanism for ACOs, MIPS APMs, group practices, and virtual groups starting with the 2021\nperformance year.\n\nMGMA comment: We oppose the proposal to sunset the Web Interface reporting mechanism in\n2021 and instead encourage CMS to delay this policy until the 2022 performance year at the earliest.\nWhile we appreciate that this proposal is intended to provide ACOs more flexibility by adding new reporting options rather than limiting ACO reporting to the Web Interface, switching to an alternative\nreporting mechanism takes time and consideration.\nImportantly, retiring the Web Interface will modify how ACOs are evaluated on quality measures.\nWhen ACOs report via the Web Interface, they provide CMS with data about Medicare beneficiaries\nthat are specific to each Web Interface measure. In contrast, the remaining MIPS reporting options\navailable to ACOs, registry (CQM) and EHR (eCQM), evaluate data on all patients, regardless of\npayer, that meet measure denominator criteria. Therefore, eliminating the Web Interface option\nwould result in a significant change in how ACOs are evaluated on quality metrics, since the\nremaining options consider all patients, rather than a predefined set of patients. More time is needed\nto evaluate whether this is appropriate and, if so, for ACOs to understand the implications of this\nchange.\nAdditionally, this proposal raises operational questions and concerns. ACOs moving to CQM or\neCQM may encounter technical difficulties and data-sharing limitations that arise from lack of\ninteroperability. ACOs often consist of several group practice TINs that all work together to achieve\nthe goals of the ACO and the program. This entails coordination across multiple practice sites, which\nmay utilize several different EHRs, and in some cases, upwards of a dozen different systems. For an\nACO that uses multiple systems, the shift away from Web Interface to CQM or eCQM may require\nadditional capabilities to enable reporting, such as retention of a separate third-party vendor to\naggregate patient data across these systems or added functionalities to existing products. This\ninvolves not only added expenses but also learning and implementing new workflows. ACOs and\ntheir participant groups need time to make these changes and secure appropriate vendors and/or\nadded technological capabilities within their current systems. They should be afforded an appropriate\nperiod of time to consider all available options, rather than being forced to rush into a contract that\nmay not be the best fit but offers the quickest solution.", "331": "MSSP: Quality performance score\nCMS proposal (85 Fed. Reg. 50234): CMS proposes to change the quality performance standard for\nMSSP ACOs from the 30th percentile on one measure to a requirement that ACOs achieve a quality\nscore equivalent to the 40th percentile or above across all quality scores.\n\nMGMA comment: While the proposal to increase quality performance scores may seem reasonable\ngiven ACOs have historically achieved high quality scores, MGMA recommends that CMS delay\nfinalizing this proposal until 2022 at the earliest. We do not believe that the 2021 performance year is\nan appropriate time to increase quality performance requirements given the uncertainty created by\nCOVID-19. CMS estimates that 95% of ACOs would exceed the proposed threshold, but this figure\nis based on prior year data when the country was not in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic and\ndoes not consider proposed changes to the quality measure set. ACOs do not know whether the\npandemic will impact their quality performance scores, which introduces uncertainty at a time when\nthey need more stability. We strongly encourage CMS to delay this proposal.\nIf CMS moves forward with finalizing this proposal for a future year, we request that the final rule\nclarify how CMS intends to apply the threshold quality score requirement. In the proposed rule, the\nagency does not clearly state whether ACOs must achieve a 40% quality score based on the\naggregate of quality measures or achieve a 40% score on each individual measure. While CMS has\ninferred informally in proposed rule education and outreach that it intends to apply this threshold at\nthe aggregate level, this must be codified in regulatory text. We urge the agency to clarify this in the\nfinal rule and to finalize a policy that sets this threshold for the aggregate of quality measure scores,\nrather than failing an ACO based on one measure score below the threshold.", "332": "MSSP: Removing pay-for-reporting year\nCMS proposal (85 Fed. Reg. 50252): CMS proposes to remove the pay-for-reporting year, which\ncurrently applies to ACOs beginning an initial MSSP contract, as well as when individual measures\nare newly introduced or undergo significant changes, such as guideline changes.\n\nMGMA comment: We oppose this proposal and urge CMS to retain the pay-for-reporting year\npolicy. Providing a pay-for-reporting year in certain instances permits an ACO to evaluate its\nworkflows, data capture processes, and other operational strategies to assess where changes are\nneeded. Further, providing a pay-for-reporting year for a newly introduced measure or measure\nundergoing significant changes mitigates the potential for unintended consequences or flaws in\nmeasure specifications before holding an ACO accountable for performance.", "333": "MSSP: Remaining 2020 proposals\nCMS proposal (85 Fed.

We also encourage CMS to finalize the policy outlined at 85 Fed. Reg.\n50254 to score ACOs on the higher of 2019 or 2020 quality scores.", "334": "CMS Web Interface\nCMS proposal (85 Fed.

These groups must generally choose between CQM, eCQM, or QCDR, which\nwill necessarily entail changes to operational workflows and will likely entail upfront expenses from\npurchasing additional EHR functionalities or registry fees, depending on the submission mechanism selected.\n\nGiven that the final rule may not be released until December, this means groups would have around\n30 days to consider a new reporting mechanism, engage in any necessary supplemental contracts, pay\nadditional expenses, learn new measure flows, and educate clinicians and staff on any operational\nchanges. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to demand continued attention and impact\nthe financial health of group practices, at least for the next several months and into 2021, MGMA\nstrongly encourages CMS to not add extra burden on groups that report using the Web Interface at\nthis time and to delay retiring this reporting mechanism by at least one year.", "335": "We agree with CMS proposal and rationale to waive the CAHPS for ACOs reporting requirement in 2020 and give all ACOs automatic full credit for the CAHPS for ACOs survey measures.", "336": "We support the alternate proposal to modify the current extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy allowing ACOs that completely and accurately report for 2020 to receive the higher of their 2020 or their 2019 quality score (or most recent quality score in the case of re-entering ACOs); and assigning the 2020 mean ACO quality score to ACOs that do not completely and accurately report for 2020. We agree this will reward ACOs that have made efforts to improve their quality ratings with the opportunity to score higher than average. We also agree the alternative policy will encourage reporting, which is important to allow analysis of the impact of PHE on quality, while still protecting ACOs from negative consequences if their performance is adversely affected by the PHE.", "337": "We believe APM participants that have taken on responsibility for total cost of care should be provided flexibilities that simplify reporting and reduce burden. As noted elsewhere in our comments, we are concerned the APP framework and corresponding elimination of the APM Scoring Standard will have a negative impact on non-ACO MIPS APM participants. While we are supportive of the proposal to ease reporting burden for MSSP participants, we ask CMS to reconsider the elimination of the APM Scoring Standard.\nIn general, we support the proposed measures, as they represent a shift away from process measures toward more meaningful outcome measures. However, fewer measures provide less room for error \u2013 random variation in one measure will have a larger impact when there are fewer measures to absorb the impact. CMS needs to monitor the measures to ensure they are not overly sensitive to minor changes in performance, random variation, or risk adjustment methodologies.\nWe ask CMS to release additional information regarding how the CAHPS survey will be calculated as one measure as soon as possible.\nWe encourage CMS to maintain the \u201cphase-in\u201d and allow ACOs in their first year to submit quality measures for pay-for-reporting. This will help practices adjust to the new structure of an ACO and the MSSP.\nWe are concerned the elimination of the Web Interface will skew MIPS benchmarks for the remaining reporting methods. Additionally, the delayed release of the final rule will not provide ACOs adequate time to identify and implement alternative reporting processes before the start of the 2021 performance period. We ask CMS to delay retiring the Web Interface until CMS identifies a method to safeguard MIPS benchmarks from being skewed by MIPS APM participants and to allow ACOs an appropriate amount of time to implement a new reporting process.", "338": "We support the transition away from an all-or-nothing reporting structure. The decrease in measures combined with the increased quality performance standard emphasizes the importance of using measures that are reliable and valid. We reiterate our request that CMS monitor the measures to ensure they are not overly sensitive to minor changes in performance, random variation, or risk adjustment methodologies.\nFurther, we also ask CMS to continue to evaluate the environment and make appropriate adjustments based on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We appreciate CMS\u2019 acknowledgment that quality benchmarks will be skewed. However, establishing benchmarks using performance period data makes it difficult for practices to gauge the impact of their performance, which is particularly troublesome for ACOs that have assumed downside risk.", "339": "We support this proposal as it provides a larger reward to ACOs for meeting CMS\u2019 increased quality performance standard. We support that an ACO\u2019s shared loss is based on its quality performance such that an ACO with a higher quality score would owe lower shared loss.", "340": "We support this proposal. We ask that CMS add the Primary Care Add-on HCPCS Code GPC1X and the new Prolonged Services Add-on CPT Code 99417 (when the base code is also a primary care service code) to the list of primary care services.\n\nWe do not support adding Principal Care Management (PCM) to the list of primary care services. We believe, like CMS, that these services will primarily be used by specialists. While the scope and description of services for CCM and PCM may be similar, it does not necessarily follow that both services should be considered primary care services.", "341": "Connected Care does not support CMS proposals to make such significant changes to how ACO quality is assessed, how quality data is reported, and how ACOs are evaluated on quality. The timing of these changes is concerning as we continue to deal with the uncertainty of COVID-19 and its continued impact on the healthcare industry. At a minimum, Connected Care requests that CMS postpone making any structural changes to the way ACO quality is assessed or reported until at least 2022.\n\nConnected Care is also concerned with Controlling High Blood Pressure (HTN-2) in its current state, which determines performance based on a single reading rather than taking into account the level of control over a period of time. There are also limitations in accepting patient reported home readings that can be more reflective of true control of high blood pressure than office-based readings. Per the measure specification, CMS does not permit \u201cinformation reported or taken by the member\u201d. Medicare beneficiaries may be reluctant to have an in-person office visit during the public health emergency (PHE) and may not have access to a remote monitoring device as described in the measure specification. As such, we request that self-reported information that clinicians can capture during telehealth visits satisfy the quality measure.\n\nAdditionally, the Unplanned Readmissions measure and CAHPS measures have very narrow bands, meaning very small differences in quality can result in drastic quality score differences that are not meaningful and do not truly measure an ACO\u2019s quality improvement efforts. We recommend CMS work with stakeholders to make improvements to the specifications for these measures before using them as part of such a limited quality measure set as proposed in the APP.\nFinally, while we support the inclusion of patient/caregiver experience measures, we have concerns that the number of CAHPS measures included in the APP is disproportionate to clinical quality and outcomes measures. There are several issues with the CAHPS measures as currently collected. As an example, the CAHPS measures use a very small sampling of patients and rely on patient recollection of experience that took place months prior. Connected Care requests that CMS consider altering surveys to accept results from shorter surveys provided closer to real time and to a much larger population.\n\nConnected Care is concerned with the potential abrupt end of Web Interface reporting, the mechanism that Connected Care has used to report quality in the past. Removing this option with little notice will create challenges for our ACO and will divert important resources from quality improvement work. We have established processes with Web Interface reporting with our participating practices that we will have to completely change. Making the switch to alternative reporting options will take considerable time, money and effort. Especially in light of the pandemic, we ask that CMS not remove options that are familiar to ACOs and take a phased in approach to introducing new reporting options.", "342": "Connected Care believes it is unfair to hold providers accountable for performance against a benchmark that would not be set until after the performance period has closed. Alternatively, we request that CMS continue to monitor the data submitted by Web Interface reporters in 2019 and continue to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on 2021 quality performance. As is the case for 2020, we suspect there will be a significant impact on quality improvement efforts in 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; we urge CMS to consider using alternative policies such as reverting all measures to pay-for-reporting or providing ACOs with the option to choose historical performance scores.", "343": "Connected Care appreciates CMS providing a fallback option for 2020 quality scores due to the impact of COVID-19. However, we still ask that CMS consider making all measures pay-for-reporting in 2020 to protect ACOs like ours whose quality scores will likely be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We support CMS\u2019 proposal to remove the requirement for ACOs to conduct a CAHPS for ACOs survey in 2020 and provide full points automatically for each of the CAHPS survey measures.", "344": "As previously noted, Connected Care requests that CMS keep in place the current measure set, reporting mechanism and scoring methods for ACO quality in 2021. We support CMS proposals to add denominator exclusions for advanced illness and frailty for the Colorectal Cancer Screening (ACO-19) and Breast Cancer Screening (ACO-20) measures. These important exclusions will ensure unnecessary care is not provided to patients with advanced illness. Additionally, Connected Care supports updates to specifications to add telehealth encounters as eligible encounters, however, we note that certain measures do not list these changes as applicable when reporting via the Web Interface. We ask that CMS clarify that all specification updates will apply regardless of reporting method and including measures reported via Web Interface.", "345": "Connected Care supports updating the definition of primary care codes used for MSSP assignment. Assignment is a critical program methodology that determines the beneficiary population for which an ACO is held accountable. Adding codes such as \u201ce-visits,\u201d chronic care management, and principal care management will help create a better picture of where patients receive most of their primary care. We support CMS finalizing the addition of the nine proposed codes to the MSSP assignment methodology.\nConnected Care also asks that CMS consider using a two-year assignment window for MSSP to account for potential variations in attribution in 2020 and 2021. Massachusetts continues to be hit harder than other states by the pandemic and some of our ACO\u2019s healthier patients are deferring routine primary care which will negatively impact our prospective attribution.

This proposed revision would align the Shared Savings Program quality performance standard with the proposed APP under the Quality Payment Program as participants in the Shared Savings Program would be required to report quality for purposes of the Shared Savings Program via the APP.\n\nOverall, this timeline and the lack of requirements are concerning for making this change in 2021. We would like to see more details. Using an already existing methodology for submitting would make it simpler. However, requiring a different submission mechanism would complicate participation.\nThe EHR Association has previously requested a minimum 18 months for development.\n\nAt a high level, the APP would replace the current Shared Savings Program quality measure set to streamline reporting requirements for Shared Savings Program ACOs and would be a complementary path to the MIPS Value Pathways. The APP is designed to reduce reporting burden, create new scoring opportunities for participants in MIPS APMs, and encourage participation in APMs.\n\nWe agree with the proposal to create a similar MVP pathway specific to APMs. However, we believe that this proposal contradicts the rationale for delaying the MVP pathway due to provider burden associated with COVID-19 and also having to learn new reporting requirements. We understand that this proposal for the participation in an APP will be optional; however, this is a brand new pathway to providers and may be confusing with other changes of sunsetting the APM scoring standard and adding the MIPS APM type to the participation statuses. We support sunsetting the APM scoring standard and adding MIPS APM type to the participation statuses under MIPS to achieve consistency in the 2021 reporting period and reducing provider burden. However, we recommend introducing both the MVP and APP models at the same time to allow providers to understand their options and have more time to prepare for this change.\nAlthough we understand the proposal based on the potential historical data discrepancies due to COVID-19, we believe that solely basing MIPS scoring on performance benchmarks potentially penalizes the providers by not allowing them to forecast and estimate their performance throughout the performance year. Therefore, we recommend", "350": "As discussed in section IV.A.3.c.(1)(b) of this proposed rule, we are proposing to sunset the CMS Web Interface measures as a collection type for groups and virtual groups with 25 or more eligible clinicians starting with the 2021 performance period.\n\nThe EHR Association supports this proposal, which focuses on electronically reported measures rather than abstraction, in alignment with CMS\u2019 interoperability initiatives.

However, we and our members are extremely concerned with the proposed changes in section IV.A.3.c.(1)(c) of this proposed rule that would sunset the CMS Web Interface submission method under MIPS for groups and virtual groups in 2021 with insufficient time for hospitals and health systems to comply with the change. Many of our member hospitals are using web interface reporting and must have more time to select a different collection/submission type and to redesign their technology systems. Since the proposed rule will not be finalized until late in the fourth quarter of 2020, hospitals will not have enough time to select, acquire and implement a new data collection and submission vehicle in order to be in compliance with the QPP program by January 1, 2021. Hospitals and other providers will need more time than 60 days to make such a significant change. Most of our members indicate that it takes at least 18 months to implement new systems, interfaces, and processes for reporting. Also, many Kentucky hospitals are in the process of implementing an entirely new enterprisewide electronic health record system which will provide the ability to submit patient quality measures using EHR Direct without having to use the CMS Web Interface submission process. However, if CMS takes action to sunset the CMS Web Interface at the end of 2020, hospitals in the middle of an EHR transition will be required to spend money to acquire a stop gap measure to comply with reporting. This additional cost and burden can be avoided if CMS would maintain the CMS Web Interface to give appropriate time for hospitals and their MIPS eligible clinicians to adjust. KHA strongly urges that CMS reconsider this change and extend the sunset date of the CMS Web Interface to the 2022 reporting period or beyond, in order to give all current users enough time to adjust to this change. Another, but more cumbersome and less desirable action would be to allow health systems to file a hardship exception for transitioning to a new EHR through which those systems would not be required to submit data for the quality or promoting interoperability categories and reweighting any remaining categories so that groups formerly using the web interface can avoid a penalty.", "391": "COVID-19 MIPS Exceptions\n\u2022 ASCRS and OOSS appreciate CMS providing burden relief via previously announced extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy exceptions for 2019 and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was originally designed to reduce reporting burden by eliminating the need for these physicians to submit data for both MIPS and their APMs. CMS is now proposing to create a new APP that would be available only to MIPS APM participants. The Cost category would be weighted at 0% and the Improvement Activities (IA) would automatically be assigned to the MIPS APM based on the requirements of the MIPS APM. The Quality category would be composed of six population-health measures and would automatically be used for purposes of the Medicare Shared Savings Program quality scoring, therefore, satisfying both programs\u2019 reporting requirements. ASCRS and OOSS are concerned that this approach fails to reduce the MIPS burden for our members \u2013 and actually increases the burden relative to the existing rules. CMS already finalized that specialists could report separately under the APM Scoring Standard using measures that are relevant to their practices, which would be used to calculate the APM Entity\u2019s quality score, unless the APM reports quality at the APM Entity level. Therefore, specialists would continue to benefit from the Cost and IA Performance category scoring rules.

This could create incentives for our members to terminate their participation in MIPS APMs. \u2022 ASCRS and OOSS, therefore, request that CMS ensure that any MIPS participant continues to benefit from the 0% weighting of the Cost performance category and full credit under the IA performance category consistent with the score assigned at the APM entity level, regardless of which quality measures they report and whether they report under MIPS at the APM Entity, TIN, or Individual level.", "394": "The\tACOS\tappreciates\tCMS\tsupporting\tclinicians\ton\tthe\tfront\tlines\tby\tproviding\tburden relief\tvia previously\tannounced\textreme\tand\tuncontrollable\tcircumstances\tpolicy exceptions\tfor\t2019\tand\t2020\tthat\taccount\tfor\tthe\tCOVID-19\tPHE.\t\tWe\turge\tCMS\tto continue\tto\tmake\tthese\thardship\texceptions\tavailable\tto\tthose\tclinicians\twho\tfeel\tthey still\tneed\tthem\tduring\tthe\t2021\tperformance\tyear.\t\t\tEven\tif\tthe\tPHE\thas\tofficially\tended by\tthat\ttime,\tmany\tclinicians\tand\tpractices\twill\tcontinue\tto\texperience\tthe\trepercussions\tof a\tstrained\tand\tdisrupted\thealthcare\tsystem,\tincluding\tfinancial\tchallenges\tand\tabnormal practice\tpatterns\tand\tpatient\tvolumes.", "395": "The\tACOS\tappreciates\tCMS\tsupporting\tclinicians\ton\tthe\tfront\tlines\tby\tproviding\tburden relief\tvia previously\tannounced\textreme\tand\tuncontrollable\tcircumstances\tpolicy exceptions\tfor\t2019\tand\t2020\tthat\taccount\tfor\tthe\tCOVID-19\tPHE.\t\tWe\turge\tCMS\tto continue\tto\tmake\tthese\thardship\texceptions\tavailable\tto\tthose\tclinicians\twho\tfeel\tthey still\tneed\tthem\tduring\tthe\t2021\tperformance\tyear.\t\t\tEven\tif\tthe\tPHE\thas\tofficially\tended by\tthat\ttime,\tmany\tclinicians\tand\tpractices\twill\tcontinue\tto\texperience\tthe\trepercussions\tof a\tstrained\tand\tdisrupted\thealthcare\tsystem,\tincluding\tfinancial\tchallenges\tand\tabnormal practice\tpatterns\tand\tpatient\tvolumes.", "396": "Hospital-Wide, 30-Day, All-Cause Unplanned Readmission Rate for the Merit-Based Incentive Payment As stated previously in the APP section, the AHA strongly opposes the inclusion of Hospital-Wide, 30-Day, All Cause Unplanned Readmission (HWR) Rate for MIPS Eligible Clinician Groups. Our primary concern is the risk of unintended consequences because it does not adequately consider the competing risk of mortality. Providers with higher mortality rates for more severely ill patients could appear to be providing better quality care. Concerns have been raised in multiple peer reviewed publications about the possible association between incentives to reduce admission and increased mortality rates.24-28 It is also unclear whether hospital readmission rates truly reflect the quality of care for all patient populations and whether incentivizing lower readmissions could potentially exacerbate disparities in care. Admission rates may be modified by providing better quality care or they may be modified by simply increasing the threshold to admit patients who would benefit from admission. Thus, they may be measuring differences in admission thresholds or even unmeasured differences in social risk or disease severity and not quality of care. The AHA suggests that CMS consider a measure such as risk-adjusted home time which, if carefully designed, might better balance the competing risks of readmission and mortality and mitigate some of these concerns. Further, CMS may want to consider the additional recommendations for improving on readmission measures and reducing the risk of potential inequities and unintended consequences included in the recent paper by Psotka et al.28 The AHA absolutely supports a systems-level approach by clinicians to better coordinate care across providers and settings of care. However, we are not convinced that holding physician groups accountable for all unplanned readmissions is the best way to accomplish this. We believe this measure of all-cause, unplanned readmissions would be far more appropriate to attribute at the ACO level only, since the structure of an ACO allows more oversight and better care coordination to influence performance on this measure.", "397": "Medicare Shared Savings Program\nFor several years, we have submitted that specialists are generally limited in their ability to participate in the Medicare Shared Saving Program (MSSP), or Medicare accountable care organizations (ACOs). While the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) continues to purport that 60 percent of ACO-participating physicians are specialists, it is unclear which specialties are predominately engaged and what their engagement looks like. We have repeatedly asked the agency to publicly report data on specialty participation in alternative payment models (APMs), including ACOs, to no avail.\nWe have made several recommendations to improve speciality participation in ACOs, but it is unclear whether they have been considered by agency officials. Now, CMS proposes to pare back the number of ACO quality measures, making specialty participation is even less likely.\nWe contend that ACO participation is important for many specialists given ongoing challenges in the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) for some specialties. We ask CMS to consider our prior recommendations and provide a formal response in the final rule, as well as work with us to identify pathways to specialty participation in Medicare ACOs", "398": "Changes to ACO Quality Scoring and Reporting\n\nQuality improvement is a cornerstone of the ACO model. In addition to reducing spending,\nACOs must meet certain quality performance standards to be eligible to receive shared\nsavings payments. ACOs continue to improve quality year over year, which improves\npatient care and helps to control costs. It is critical that CMS policies to evaluate ACO\nquality are fair, appropriate and accurately reflect the work ACOs undertake to improve\npatient care. CMS\u2019s proposals to change the way ACO quality is assessed, reported and\nscored for the purpose of shared savings calculation are significant and more feedback\nshould be collected before moving forward with such drastic changes. Further, as stated in\nprevious comments, LGHCCC strongly believes ACOs should not be evaluated and\nassessed in the same manner as all other APMs or individual MIPS clinicians. ACOs are\nhigh-quality performers, however, this should not serve as a reason for CMS to overhaul the\nentire quality performance assessment approach for the MSSP. Instead, we urge CMS to\nwork with other stakeholders to make changes to the current quality measure performance\nevaluation criteria and measure set for ACOs to further refine the measures and criteria as\nappropriate for a group of providers who are responsible for total cost of care for the\npopulations they serve. Clinicians in MIPS who are not participating in total cost of care and\nfull accountability payment models should not necessarily have the same quality measure\nset and scoring approach as ACOs. Likewise, each APM has specific goals and objectives, and the one size fits all approach under the proposed APP structure does not account for\nthose differences.", "399": "Comments: The proposed six APP measures are a drastic reduction from the 23 measures\nACOs are currently assessed on. While LGHCCC supports reducing reporting burdens and\nefforts to eliminate low value measures, we feel these proposals go too far by reducing the\nnumber of clinical quality measures to a mere three measures. Quality improvement is a\ncritical and core component of an ACO\u2019s work. We therefore recommend CMS consider\nmaintaining several key clinical quality measures that are foundational to an ACO\u2019s quality\nimprovement work and have been proven to improve outcomes including: ACO-14,\nInfluenza Immunization; ACO-19, Colorectal Cancer Screening; ACO-20, Breast Cancer\nScreening; and the previously used Pneumonia Vaccination measure. While ACOs can\nchoose to continue to work on these preventive measures whether or not they are included\nin the MSSP\u2019s official measure list, we think it is critical for CMS to evaluate both individual\nACOs and the program as a whole on these foundational prevention measures. Further,\nsince the ACO program already gives ACOs a direct financial incentive to reduce avoidable\nadmissions and readmissions, we do not feel it is appropriate to have one third of the total\nmeasure set focused on utilization measures. We also urge CMS to do more comparative\nresearch on how ACO quality on these core measures and improvement areas contrasts to\nnon-ACO quality and to make the data and research findings public. This type of\ncomparison cannot fairly be done if ACOs are only measured on one diabetes measure,\none blood pressure measure, and one depression screening measure as proposed in the \nAPP, nor does it reflect the true purpose and work ACOs do in the quality improvement\nspace.\n\nAdditionally, we have concerns with the Screening for Depression and Follow-Up Plan\nmeasure, as well as the Days at Home measure discussed but not formally proposed.\nUnderstanding the degree to which individuals spend their time at home is a useful indicator\nto determine if the healthcare system is achieving one of its primary goals. While this\nindicator provides a viewpoint broader than measures such as admissions or readmissions,\nthe many different factors that can affect patients\u2019 \u201chealthy days at home\u201d raise serious\nconcerns about whether differences in performance on this measure can be reliably\nattributed to the services delivered by ACOs and whether it would truly distinguish the\nquality of care ACO participants deliver. We also are concerned with the controlling high\nblood pressure measure in its current state, which determines performance based on a\nsingle reading rather than taking into account the level of control over a period of time.\nThere are also limitations in accepting patient reported home readings that can be more\nreflective of true control of high blood pressure than office-based readings. Further, the\nMIPS Unplanned Admissions for Multiple Chronic Conditions measure does not meet the\nrequired 0.7 reliability threshold, and therefore we urge CMS to increase testing, particularly\nfor risk adjustment, and increase case minimums for this measure before including it in the\nproposed APP measure set. Finally, the Unplanned Readmissions measure and CAHPS\nmeasures have very narrow bands, meaning very small differences in quality can result in\nvery drastic quality score differences that are not meaningful and do not truly measure an\nACO\u2019s quality improvement efforts. We recommend CMS work with stakeholders to make\nimprovements to the specifications for these measures before using them as part of such a\nlimited quality measure set as proposed in the APP.", "400": "Finally, while we support the inclusion of patient satisfaction measures, we have concerns\nthat the number of CAHPS measures included in the APP is disproportionate to clinical\nquality and outcomes measures. There are several issues with the CAHPS measures as\ncurrently collected. As an example, the CAHPS measures use a very small sampling of\npatients and rely on patient recollection of experience that took place months prior. CMS\nshould consider altering surveys to accept results from shorter surveys provided closer to\nreal time and to a much larger population.", "401": "Comments: CMS proposes to abruptly end the use of the Web Interface reporting\nmechanism, a tool that has been used since the MSSP\u2019s inception. Removing this option for\nall ACOs with little notice is ill-timed and unfair. Further, CMS has not been clear regarding\nhow the alternative MIPS reporting options will be utilized for ACOs (as APM Entities)\nspecifically. There are several key questions and obstacles to moving away from this\nreporting method in this timeframe. For example, the current remaining MIPS reporting\noptions available under the APP would be registry (MIPS CQMs) and EHR (eCQMs). Using \nthese reporting options would result in the ACO being evaluated on quality for all patients\nthe ACO\u2019s providers serve, not only ACO assigned patients. This is not a true evaluation of\nthe ACO\u2019s quality efforts and, additionally, raises contractual and legal concerns, as an\nACO may not have the ability to access patient data for non-ACO patients. This would also\nmake quality evaluations challenging. In effect, assessing ACOs on their quality actions for\nall patients rather than ACO patients would be evaluating the ACO\u2019s spillover effects and\nwould not directly evaluate the true impact of their work on their ACO patients. Further, a\ngoal of APMs is to promote provider investment in processes and tools to improve\noutcomes. Many ACOs have invested significant resources for development of reporting\nprocesses and workflows to optimize this process; removing this option altogether would\nundermine these investments, thus diverting critical resources away from improving patient\ncare.\n\nAdditionally, making the switch to these alternative reporting options will cost many ACOs\nconsiderable time, money and effort in changing workflows, paying for registries and\nadapting and modifying EHRs to comply with eCQM standards. As an example, some\nACOs would need to pay large fees for modifying EHRs to capture the appropriate quality\ndata and to change performance dashboards. These fees can be significant, and a large\nhardship particularly for smaller ACOs. Other ACOs may need to explore working with\nregistries, which again, could come with additional fees to the ACO. For these reasons, we\nurge CMS to provide a more gradual transition away from the use of the Web Interface\nreporting option to give more time and thought to how this will practically be implemented\nand to give ACOs more time to assess their alternatives. While LGHCCC supports the\nmovement toward more automated reporting, the timeline CMS proposes is unreasonable\nand creates a hardship for ACOs. Specifically, we urge CMS to allow the Web Interface to\nbe continued as an option for the foreseeable future while carefully considering additional\nreporting options for ACOs.\n\nFinally, moving to a registry or EHR-based reporting method will significantly increase the\nnumber of patients an ACO must report on and be evaluated on under CMS proposals.\nCurrently, ACOs must report on 248 ACO patients included in the Web Interface. Under the\nregistry option, an ACO would have to report on 60 percent of their patients, both Medicare\nand non-Medicare patients as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For the EHR reporting\nmethod, ACOs would be required to report on 70 percent of patients, both Medicare and\nnon-Medicare as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For some ACOs this could be a\ndrastic increase and will therefore add significant administrative burden for the ACO. Should\nCMS finalize this approach, the agency should be requiring the ACO to report on, at a\nmaximum, 50 percent of exclusively ACO patients. These specification issues and\ndifferences demonstrate why LGHCCC feels an ACO-tailored approach to quality\nmeasurement and assessment is more appropriate than trying to make the MIPS program\nand standards apply to ACOs.", "402": "Comments: LGHCCC opposes the proposal to remove the pay-for-reporting year currently\nprovided to ACOs for individual measures that are newly introduced to the measure set.\nThis change would also remove the ability of CMS to provide a pay-for-reporting year when\nmeasures undergo significant changes, such as guideline and specification changes.\nProviding the pay-for-reporting year is critical to an ACO\u2019s success. This flexibility in scoring\nwhen a measure undergoes significant changes allows an ACO to evaluate their current\nworkflows, data capture processes and other operational strategies to see where changes\nare needed and what areas to focus on. Further, providing a newly introduced measure with\na pay-for-reporting year ensures there are no unintended consequences or flaws in the\nmeasure specifications before holding an ACO accountable for performance on the\nmeasure. Allowing this time to assess workflows and operations before ACOs are held\naccountable for performance on measures allows ACOs to be successful in getting credit\nfor the good quality improvement work they are already engaged in, as often times a\nmeasure is not only assessing true quality but also how the quality data are captured. We\nurge CMS to not finalize this approach and instead maintain the pay-for-reporting year\nprovided to ACOs for new quality measures when they are introduced or significantly\nchanged. The current MIPS policy would allow for suppression of a measure that undergoes \nsignificant specification changes: under the proposed new APP scoring approach this would\nsignificantly disadvantage ACOs who could see drastic swings in their performance based\non suppression of just one measure.\n\nAdditionally, LGHCCC opposes the overall approach proposed for ACO quality scoring.\nWith upcoming changes to MIPS through the MIPS Value Pathways and exemptions due to\nextreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as for COVID-19, the 40th percentile of the\nQuality Category score could vary greatly from year to year making it a less meaningful\nindicator of true performance. Instead, should CMS move forward with proposals to redesign the quality assessment structure for ACOs, we urge CMS to utilize a scoring\napproach that is more similar to the current domain-based scoring approach instead of\nusing an all-or-nothing approach as proposed. As an example, CMS could instead consider\na policy that would use a minimum attainment standard that requires 50 percent of the\nquality measures to meet or exceed the 40th percentile. This must be done in conjunction\nwith our recommendations to add additional clinical quality measures to the measure set\nbeyond the three that CMS has currently proposed. Setting the standard at 50 percent\nensures that ACOs perform well on a substantial set of measures to earn savings but does\nnot punish ACOs that miss the mark on a measure that is either not as relevant to their\npatient population or has a very narrow range of performance rates.

G (2)(b)(4)(1)(c) Groups and Virtual Groups Reporting via the CMS Web Interface We are in support of the reduction in quality measures (Table 36) from 23 to 6, with three being submitted annually. However, we have some doubts about the replacement of Web Interface as a submission method. As an Advanced APM, our ACO is only obligated to file quality through the MSSP data abstraction process. As such, our practices do not file MIPS and have not been set up to file MIPS; therefore, some of the assumptions you could make for a MIPS practice or an ACO-MIPS practice may not be valid in an AAPM practice. Our ACO, like many others, is a combination of employed clinicians and contracted clinicians. Although our employed clinicians are on a single CEHRT, our contracted clinicians are smaller practices and using many different types of CEHRT which is not fed into our system. While we appreciate the efforts that CMS is making to align the measures and make filing easier, our assessment indicates that we would not be able to take advantage of this proposed APP process of using eCQM or MIPS CQM because of the variations in CEHRT. We believe that, if CMS were to remove the current Web Interface process, we would still have to perform data abstraction to collect the data. It is not clear to us how we could then aggregate that information to submit through this new system without significant programming changes. As a solution, we would appreciate having the option to remain on Web Interface; or we would be open to a CMS solution that would allow ACO with different CEHRTs a pathway to APP.", "429": "Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) and the APM Performance Pathway (APP) Reporting Option\n\nWe note the CMS proposal to reduce the number of quality measures in the MSSP from 23 to six.\nAlthough we generally favor proposals that involve streamlining, reducing burden, or reducing\ncomplexity, it is not clear that this specific action will be good for beneficiaries. Presumably, focusing the\nentire quality measure set of ACOs on six specific measures would be based on a solid body of research \nwork showing that these measures have some special kind of \u201csentinel\u201d or \u201cleading indicator\u201d status\nsuch that good performance on these measures reflect a broader underlying quality factor that would\nshow up in higher scores on a large number of other measures. Or, the choice would be based on a body\nof science showing that these six measures, above all others, reflect the quality dimensions with the\ngreatest significance to overall population health as assessed by broad measures of life expectancy,\nfunctional status, or general wellbeing. None of that appears here. Although each measure has some\nscientific merit as a quality of care measure, none are supported by any solid evidence for some kind of\nunique standing as a \u201csentinel\u201d quality measure, and those that involve outcomes (perhaps five of the\nsix, depending on nuances of definition) require careful attention to risk adjustment before they can be\nclearly and fairly interpreted as quality of care measures. Per points made above about social risk\nadjustment, we believe that none of the outcome measures at the moment have adequate risk\nadjustment in order to be used in a way that fairly compares ACOs on the quality of care they provide.\n\nTherefore, we do not support this movement to just six quality measures, unless CMS can bring forward\nevidence of the unique standing of these measures as \u201csentinel\u201d quality measures of high significance,\nand unless CMS can enhance the risk adjustment models used in these measures to assure that ACOs\nserving either clinically or socially high-risk patient populations are fairly evaluated.", "430": "First, replacing the current domain-based quality scoring approach with an all or nothing standard is a significant change that will have a big impact on ACO performance.", "431": "Secondly, drastically reducing the number of quality measures from 23 to six de-emphasizes quality and will create a performance standard that may not be truly representative of an ACO's actual quality improvement efforts.", "432": "Thirdly, abruptly removing the Web Interface as a reporting mechanism will have a big impact on ACOs' ability to get credit for their true quality efforts.

Further, these changes come amidst the unprecedented COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE). The timing of these changes is very concerning as ACOs continue to deal with the uncertainty that the COVID-19 PHE is bringing to the health care industry. At a minimum we urge CMS to postpone making any structural changes to the way ACO quality is assessed or reported until at least 2022. Finally, while these proposed changes align more with the way individual clinicians and groups are scored in MIPS, it is a farther departure from the way CMS assesses other non fee-for-service providers, such as Medicare Advantage. Therefore, this effort at alignment is a step backward for ACOs and those committed to value. Quality improvement is a cornerstone of the ACO model. In addition to reducing spending, ACOs must meet certain quality performance standards to be eligible to receive shared savings payments. ACOs continue to improve quality year over year, which improves patient care and helps to control costs. It is critical that CMS policies to evaluate ACO quality are fair, appropriate and accurately reflect the work ACOs undertake to improve patient care. CMS\u2019s proposals to change the way ACO quality is assessed, reported and scored for the purpose of shared savings calculation are significant and more feedback should be collected before moving forward with such drastic changes. Further, as stated in previous comments, CHPA strongly believes ACOs should not be evaluated and assessed in the same manner as all other APMs or individual MIPS clinicians. ACOs are high-quality performers, however, this should not serve as a reason for CMS to overhaul the entire quality performance assessment approach for the MSSP. Instead, we urge CMS to work with CHPA and other stakeholders to make changes to the current quality measure performance evaluation criteria and measure set for ACOs to further refine the measures and criteria as appropriate for a group of providers who are responsible for total cost of care for the populations they serve. Clinicians in MIPS who are not participating in total cost of care and full 3 accountability payment models should not necessarily have the same quality measure set and scoring approach as ACOs. Likewise, each APM has specific goals and objectives, and the one size fits all approach under the proposed APP structure does not account for those differences.", "454": "The proposed six APP measures are a drastic reduction from the 23 measures ACOs are currently assessed on. While CHPA supports reducing reporting burdens and efforts to eliminate low value measures, we feel these proposals go too far by reducing the number of clinical quality measures to a mere three measures. Quality improvement is a critical and core component of an ACO\u2019s work. We therefore recommend CMS consider maintaining several key clinical quality measures that are foundational to an ACO\u2019s quality improvement work and have been proven to improve outcomes including: ACO-14, Influenza Immunization; ACO-19, Colorectal Cancer Screening; ACO-20, Breast Cancer Screening; and the previously used Pneumonia Vaccination measure. While ACOs can choose to continue to work on these preventive measures whether or not they are included in the MSSP\u2019s official measure list, we think it is critical for CMS to evaluate both individual ACOs and the program as a whole on these foundational prevention measures. Further, since the ACO program already gives ACOs a direct financial incentive to reduce avoidable admissions and readmissions, we do not feel it is appropriate to have one third of the total measure set focused on utilization measures. We also urge CMS to do more comparative research on how ACO quality on these core measures and improvement areas contrasts to non-ACO quality and to make the data and research findings public. This type of comparison cannot fairly be done if ACOs are only measured on one diabetes measure, one blood pressure measure, and one depression screening measure as proposed in the APP, nor does it reflect the true purpose and work ACOs do in the quality improvement space. 4 Additionally, we have concerns with the Screening for Depression and Follow-Up Plan measure, as well as the Days at Home measure discussed but not formally proposed. Understanding the degree to which individuals spend their time at home is a useful indicator to determine if the healthcare system is achieving one of its primary goals. While this indicator provides a viewpoint broader than measures such as admissions or readmissions, the many different factors that can affect patients\u2019 \u201chealthy days at home\u201d raise serious concerns about whether differences in performance on this measure can be reliably attributed to the services delivered by ACOs and whether it would truly distinguish the quality of care ACO participants deliver. We also are concerned with the controlling high blood pressure measure in its current state, which determines performance based on a single reading rather than taking into account the level of control over a period of time. There are also limitations in accepting patient reported home readings that can be more reflective of true control of high blood pressure than office-based readings. Further, the MIPS Unplanned Admissions for Multiple Chronic Conditions measure does not meet the required 0.7 reliability threshold, and therefore we urge CMS to increase testing, particularly for risk adjustment, and increase case minimums for this measure before including it in the proposed APP measure set. Finally, the Unplanned Readmissions measure and CAHPS measures have very narrow bands, meaning very small differences in quality can result in very drastic quality score differences that are not meaningful and do not truly measure an ACO\u2019s quality improvement efforts. We recommend CMS work with stakeholders to make improvements to the specifications for these measures before using them as part of such a limited quality measure set as proposed in the APP.", "455": "Finally, while we support the inclusion of patient satisfaction measures, we have concerns that the number of CAHPS measures included in the APP is disproportionate to clinical quality and outcomes measures. There are several issues with the CAHPS measures as currently collected. As an example, the CAHPS measures use a very small sampling of patients and rely on patient recollection of experience that took place months prior. CMS should consider altering surveys to accept results from shorter surveys provided closer to real time and to a much larger population.", "456": "CMS proposes to abruptly end the use of the Web Interface reporting mechanism, a tool that has been used since the MSSP\u2019s inception. Removing this option for all ACOs with little notice is illtimed and unfair. Further, CMS has not been clear regarding how the alternative MIPS reporting options will be utilized for ACOs (as APM Entities) specifically. There are several key questions and obstacles to moving away from this reporting method in this timeframe. For example, the current remaining MIPS reporting options available under the APP would be registry (MIPS CQMs) and EHR (eCQMs). Using these reporting options would result in the ACO being evaluated on quality for all patients the ACO\u2019s providers serve, not only ACO assigned patients. This is not a true evaluation of the ACO\u2019s quality efforts and, additionally, raises contractual and legal concerns, as an ACO may not have the ability to access patient data for non-ACO patients. This would also make quality evaluations challenging. In effect, assessing ACOs on their quality actions for all patients rather than ACO patients would be evaluating the ACO\u2019s spillover effects and would not directly evaluate the true impact of their work on their ACO patients. 5 Further, a goal of APMs is to promote provider investment in processes and tools to improve outcomes. Many ACOs have invested significant resources for development of reporting processes and workflows to optimize this process; removing this option altogether would undermine these investments, thus diverting critical resources away from improving patient care. Additionally, making the switch to these alternative reporting options will cost many ACOs considerable time, money and effort in changing workflows, paying for registries and adapting and modifying EHRs to comply with eCQM standards. As an example, some ACOs would need to pay large fees for modifying EHRs to capture the appropriate quality data and to change performance dashboards. These fees can be significant, and a large hardship particularly for smaller ACOs. Other ACOs may need to explore working with registries, which again, could come with additional fees to the ACO. For these reasons, we urge CMS to provide a more gradual transition away from the use of the Web Interface reporting option to give more time and thought to how this will practically be implemented and to give ACOs more time to assess their alternatives. While CHPA supports the movement toward more automated reporting, the timeline CMS proposes is unreasonable and creates a hardship for ACOs. Specifically, we urge CMS to allow the Web Interface to be continued as an option for the foreseeable future while carefully considering additional reporting options for ACOs. Finally, moving to a registry or EHR-based reporting method will significantly increase the number of patients an ACO must report on and be evaluated on under CMS proposals. Currently, ACOs must report on 248 ACO patients included in the Web Interface. Under the registry option, an ACO would have to report on 60 percent of their patients, both Medicare and non-Medicare patients as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For the EHR reporting method, ACOs would be required to report on 70 percent of patients, both Medicare and non-Medicare as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For some ACOs this could be a drastic increase and will therefore add significant administrative burden for the ACO. Should CMS finalize this approach, the agency should be requiring the ACO to report on, at a maximum, 50 percent of exclusively ACO patients. These specification issues and differences demonstrate why CHPA feels an ACO-tailored approach to quality measurement and assessment is more appropriate than trying to make the MIPS program and standards apply to ACOs. This will be increasingly important as CHPA predicts many ACOs will not be able to meet the increasing QP thresholds in the coming years and will therefore find themselves subject to MIPS, even those takin", "457": "CHPA opposes the proposal to remove the pay-for-reporting year currently provided to ACOs beginning an initial MSSP contract, as well as individual measures that are newly introduced to the measure set. This change would also remove the ability of CMS to provide a pay-for-reporting year when measures undergo significant changes, such as guideline and specification changes. Providing the payfor-reporting year is critical to an ACO\u2019s success. This flexibility in scoring when a measure undergoes significant changes allows an ACO to evaluate their current workflows, data capture processes and other operational strategies to see where changes are needed and what areas to focus on. Further, providing a newly introduced measure with a pay-for-reporting year ensures there are no unintended consequences or flaws in the measure specifications before holding an ACO accountable for performance on the measure. Allowing this time to assess workflows and operations before ACOs are held accountable for performance on measures allows ACOs to be successful in getting credit for the good quality improvement work they are already engaged in, as often times a measure is not only assessing true quality but also how the quality data are captured. We urge CMS to not finalize this approach and instead maintain the pay-for-reporting year provided to ACOs in their initial contract year, as well as new quality measures when they are introduced or significantly changed. The current MIPS policy would allow for suppression of a measure that undergoes significant specification changes: under the proposed new APP scoring approach this would significantly disadvantage ACOs who could see drastic swings in their performance based on suppression of just one measure. Additionally, CHPA opposes the overall approach proposed for ACO quality scoring. With upcoming changes to MIPS through the MIPS Value Pathways and exemptions due to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as for COVID-19, the 40th percentile of the Quality Category score could vary greatly from year to year making it a less meaningful indicator of true performance. Instead, should CMS move forward with proposals to re-design the quality assessment structure for ACOs, we urge CMS to utilize a 7 scoring approach that is more similar to the current domain-based scoring approach instead of using an all-or-nothing approach as proposed. As an example, CMS could instead consider a policy that would use a minimum attainment standard that requires 50 percent of the quality measures to meet or exceed the 40th percentile. This must be done in conjunction with our recommendations to add additional clinical quality measures to the measure set beyond the three that CMS has currently proposed. Setting the standard at 50 percent ensures that ACOs perform well on a substantial set of measures to earn savings but does not punish ACOs that miss the mark on a measure that is either not as relevant to their patient population or has a very narrow range of performance rates. Finally, CHPA also urges CMS to better reward high quality performers, as is done in the Medicare Advantage program by providing bonuses or higher shared savings rates to high quality performers or those that notably improve quality scores over time.", "458": "Additionally, CHPA opposes the overall approach proposed for ACO quality scoring.

First, we cannot contemplate instances when the proposed APP measures listed would be determined to not apply to an ACO. Second, allowing this option would make program evaluation nearly impossible. Evaluating ACO\u2019s impact on quality should be a key focus for CMS and, therefore, there should be one standard set of quality measures that apply to all ACOs participating in the model. Finally, CHPA has concerns that this policy would allow certain organizations to select measures for which they have the highest historical performance, not allowing for a true and fair assessment of quality improvement efforts across ACOs.", "460": "CHPA is pleased to see CMS providing a fallback option for 2020 quality scores due to the impact of COVID-19. While CHPA prefers to see all measures reverted to pay-for-reporting in 2020, we support this alternative approach that will protect ACOs whose quality scores are affected by the COVID19 pandemic. We are also pleased to see CMS remove the requirement for ACOs to field a CAHPS for ACOs survey in 2020 and provide full points automatically for each of the CAHPS survey measures. We urge CMS to finalize these proposals. We also ask CMS to begin considering alternative polices and exceptions for the COVID-19 PHE for PY 2021, which CMS does not address or discuss in this proposed rule. The COVID-19 pandemic will continue beyond January 1, 2021, and while the severity and impact of the pandemic in 2021 are unknown at this time, we urge CMS to also provide the fallback option of 8 making all quality measures pay-for-reporting in 2021, or alternatively providing ACOs with historical performance scores. ACOs need certainty that they will be protected from the affects of the pandemic on quality, which are outside their control.", "461": "As noted above, we urge CMS to keep in place the current measure set, reporting mechanism and scoring methods for ACO quality in 2021. Therefore, we support CMS proposals to add denominator exclusions for advanced illness and frailty for the breast cancer and colorectal cancer screening measures, as previously advocated for by CHPA. These important exclusions will ensure unnecessary care is not provided to patients with advanced illness. Additionally, CHPA supports updates to specifications to add telehealth encounters as eligible encounters, however, we note that certain measures do not list these changes as applicable when reporting via the Web Interface. CMS should clarify that all specification updates will apply regardless of reporting method and including measures reported via Web Interface. CMS should also clarify the proposed changes to the influenza immunization measure. CMS notes a qualifying encounter must occur between January 1 and March 31, 2021 for the 2020 timeframe. For the 2021 timeframe CMS notes the qualifying encounter must occur between October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. This is a significant change, or an error. Instead we urge CMS to clarify the 2021-2022 qualifying timeframe is at a minimum between September 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 in order to capture those that receive their flu shot in September, and we urge CMS to capture the entire flu season as has been the case in the past, looking at September 2021 through March 2022. Additionally, needing an in-person encounter for the flu shot during a predefined timeframe is not practical, whether it is a telehealth encounter or in-person encounter. Many patients will receive the flu shot at a pharmacy, where there is a Part B charge but not an encounter. These patients receiving flu shots in the pharmacy setting should meet the measure criteria as well.", "462": "We do not support CMS making further changes to the MSSP Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances policy at this time. Given the vast changes proposed to the MSSP Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances policy over the last two years and the additional, alternative policies that have been put in place in 2019 and 2020 to account for COVID-19, CMS should refrain from making any significant changes to this policy at this time and continue to assess the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 before making any further changes to the established policy. As noted above, we also urge CMS to begin considering alternative policies for 2021 due to COVID-19 for both financial and quality assessments for ACOs. As noted above, we do not support CMS proposals to change ACO quality assessments, and therefore we also do not support the proposed changes to the MSSP Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Policy to align with the new APP proposals.", "463": "Securing a repayment mechanism is a regulatory burden, which is time consuming and costly for ACOs. We appreciate CMS\u2019s efforts to minimize burdens associated with the repayment mechanism. Currently, a renewing ACO that wants to use its existing repayment mechanism in the subsequent agreement period is required to maintain a higher repayment mechanism amount than necessary for its new agreement period if the repayment mechanism amount for the last performance year of the previous agreement period is greater than what is needed for the subsequent agreement period. We support CMS\u2019s proposal to eliminate this requirement and recommend it be finalized.", "464": "Under the Pathways to Success regulations when a recalculated repayment mechanism increases by a certain amount (i.e., the lesser of 50 percent or $1,000,000), CMS requires the ACO to increase the value of the repayment mechanism. However, CMS does not currently decrease the repayment mechanism amount when the opposite occurs, a policy for which CHPA has advocated and which the agency proposes to change in this rule. We appreciate CMS\u2019s proposal to allow ACOs an option to decrease their repayment mechanism amount if the recalculated amount is less than the current amount, and we request the agency finalize this policy. We also support CMS providing an opportunity for ACOs that renewed their agreements effective in 2019 or 2020 an opportunity to benefit from this policy change, if finalized, by adjusting their repayment mechanism amounts already in place, if they quality under the revised policy.", "465": "We support CMS\u2019s proposals in the rule, but we also urge the agency to take additional steps to minimize burdens associated with repayment mechanism requirements. Many ACOs cite the burden and cost of securing a repayment mechanism as reasons not to move to a risk-based ACO model. Instead of requiring a repayment mechanism that pays banks and brokers and takes money away from the ACO executing its core mission of improving patient care, we urge CMS to remove the repayment mechanism requirement when an ACO can prove that it has an investor or financial backer with a demonstrated high credit rating. Financial backers could include outside investors, insurers or hospitals or health systems that are involved with the ACO and providing financial support, which would be available should losses occur. This assurance would protect the Medicare Trust Fund in the event the ACO has losses while avoiding the financial inefficiency and regulatory burden of involving outside financial institutions as third parties that benefit from the repayment mechanism requirements. This would also eliminate the need to have a 24-month tail period. The additional burden of a 24-month \u201ctail period\u201d heightens concerns and increases financial requirements for ACOs. Should CMS maintain requirements for a repayment mechanism, we request the agency to minimize this regulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for tail period coverage, which is especially important considering the longer agreement periods", "466": "CHPA supports updating the definition of primary care codes used for MSSP assignment. Assignment is a critical program methodology that determines the beneficiary population for which an ACO is held accountable. Adding codes such as \u201ce-visits,\u201d chronic care management, and principal care management will help create a better picture of where patients receive most of their primary care. CMS should continue to refine the primary care codes used in assignment, and we request that the agency do so in a timely manner. We recommend CMS finalize adding the nine proposed codes to the MSSP assignment methodology. CHPA also appreciates CMS\u2019s desire to ensure that patients are attributed to providers from whom they receive their primary care services. Therefore, we support excluding advance care planning services from MSSP assignment when billed in an inpatient setting and also excluding professional services furnished by FQHCs or RHCs when delivered in a SNF. Both of these changes, while technical in nature, help create more complete and accurate patient assignment lists for ACOs and we recommend the agency finalize these proposals. While CHPA appreciates CMS\u2019s work to refine assignment during the COVID-19 PHE, CHPA recommends that CMS use a two-year assignment window for MSSP to account for potential variations in attribution in 2020 and 2021. Especially in states hit harder by the pandemic, healthy patients may forego routine primary care and throw off assignment for MSSP ACOs who use either retrospective or prospective attribution. Therefore, patient visits from 2019 and 2020 should be considered for ACOs\u2019 assignment lists regardless if ACOs choose prospective attribution or retrospective attribution. While the windows for either groups of ACOs will be different, the same general principle applies and would help create 11 more steady and accurate assignment lists. The Next Generation ACO Model uses a two-year assignment window already.", "467": "To date, however, CMS has limited telehealth waivers in ACOs, including MSSP and related CMS Innovation Center models, to patients\u2019 geographic location and originating site, allowing telehealth to be delivered to patients outside of rural settings and in their homes. Instead, CHPA urges that CMS use its statutory authority under 42 U.S.C. 1315a(d)(1) (in the case of CMMI models) and 42 U.S.C. 1395jjj(f) (in the case of MSSP) to allow all ACOs, regardless of risk level or choice of attribution, the freedom to use telehealth in broader circumstances. This includes expanding waivers beyond the patient\u2019s site of care 12 and geographic location. Also expanding telehealth waivers to FQHCs and RHCs allowing telehealth to be provided by these primary care settings. Specifically, CMS should provide ACOs access to a broader set of telehealth waivers and expand what telehealth waivers cover, for example, waiving patient cost-sharing, additional modalities like telephone-only, supervision allowances, waivers on the frequency of telehealth visits, and covered services, such as those CMS says need some level of in-person care delivered in conjunction with telehealth. ACOs should be allowed greater freedoms to see patients \u2014 attributed through either prospective assignment or preliminary prospective assignment \u2014 without requirements on needing a corresponding in-person visit within a specified period of time after the telehealth visit. In the remote monitoring space, CMS could allow ACOs to monitor patient health for shorter periods of time and wider sets of clinical circumstances, as the agency seeks comment on elsewhere in the proposed rule. Because ACOs take accountability for a patient population, CMS should grant them the tools to care for those populations in ways that they see best, and waivers shouldn\u2019t be limited to patients\u2019 geographic location and originating site. Enacting these changes would achieve a dual purpose of expanding the reach of telehealth \u2014 with the access to care and quality improvement it brings \u2014 along with enticing more providers to join value-based payment models like ACOs", "468": "CMS proposes to allow individual clinicians and group TINs the option of choosing to report outside the ACO for purposes of MIPS analysis. Should a practice or clinician choose this option, it would be required to select the appropriate measures and reporting method and report separately from the ACO for purposes of MIPS scoring. In this case, these clinicians/groups would only be provided with 50 percent automatic credit for improvement activities (while ACOs are awarded with full points automatically for this performance category). CMS would then award clinicians with the higher of their own scores or the ACO\u2019s score for MIPS. Comments: CHPA has concerns that this policy would allow certain organizations to select measures for which they have the highest historical performance, not allowing for a true and fair assessment of quality improvement efforts. Additionally, this could cause more complexity and confusion to an already very complicated process. We instead urge CMS to maintain the APM Scoring Standard approach, under which ACOs would be evaluated on MSSP quality measures for MIPS.", "469": "We are also pleased to see CMS remove the requirement for ACOs to field a CAHPS for ACOs survey in 2020 and provide full points automatically for each of the CAHPS survey measures. We urge CMS to finalize these proposals. We also ask CMS to begin considering alternative polices and exceptions for the COVID-19 PHE for PY 2021, which CMS does not address or discuss in this proposed rule. The COVID-19 pandemic will continue beyond January 1, 2021, and while the severity and impact of the pandemic in 2021 are unknown at this time, we urge CMS to also provide the fallback option of making all quality measures pay-for-reporting in 2021, or alternatively providing ACOs with historical performance scores. ACOs need certainty that they will be protected from the affects of the pandemic on quality, which are outside their control.", "470": "First, replacing the current domain-based quality scoring approach with an all or nothing standard is a significant change that will have a big impact on ACO performance.", "471": "Secondly, drastically reducing the number of quality measures from 23 to six de-emphasizes quality and will create a performance standard that may not be truly representative of an ACO's actual quality improvement efforts.", "472": "Thirdly, abruptly removing the Web Interface as a reporting mechanism will have a big impact on ACOs' ability to get credit for their true quality efforts. CMS should continue to offer the Web Interface as an option and over time allow additional reporting options to those ACOs who would be ready to implement, such as registry or Electronic Health Record (EHR) reporting.", "473": "Additionally, moving to the alternative reporting options CMS has provided through the proposed APM Performance Pathway (APP) would cause many ACOs to have to pay for registries and/or EHR upgrades and dashboards to capture the correct data to be able to report to CMS.\n\n Finally, there are remaining questions regarding how the ACO would report the data for non-Medicare and non-ACO patient data, which is required when reporting using a registry or EHR. This could cause ACOs to have to revisit contracts and could raise legal concerns as the ACO does not typically have access to non-ACO patient data.", "474": "Finally, we also have deep concerns with CMS's proposal to remove the pay-for-reporting year currently provided to first time ACOs as well as quality measures that are newly introduced or undergo significant changes. ACOs use the pay-for-reporting year as a time to get the correct processes and performance dashboards in place to be able to be successful in their quality improvement efforts. These are critical and removing them while still holding ACOs accountable for new quality measures, as an example, is unfair and will cause ACOs to hesitate to enter the program. ACOs are committed to providing high quality care to our patients and quality improvement is at the core of what we do.", "475": "CHPA also advocates for expansion of telehealth services to include ACO waivers for the FQHCs and RHCs. Providing these services to the most vulnerable is critical to maintaining and improving the health of our population.", "476": "As the accountable care organization (ACO) that brought this concern to CMS, Community Health Center Network of Idaho (CHCNI) fully supports the CMS proposal to revise the existing exclusion for professional services billed under CPT codes 99304 through 99318 that are furnished in a SNF to include services reported on an FQHC or RHC claim that includes those CPT codes, when those services are furnished in a SNF. We further support the proposal that this revision would also be applicable to determining ACO beneficiary assignment for the performance year starting on January 1, 2021, and subsequent performance years. CHCNI is comprised solely of federally-qualified health centers (FQHC). The mission of all FQHCs is to provide quality care to anyone, regardless of their ability to pay. The FQHC mission makes the prospect of risk sharing a daunting one, but also in alignment with our commitment to our patients. The Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) provides an opportunity for healthcare networks like ours to build infrastructure to prepare to participate in risk sharing in value-based contracts. However, the current program exclusion regarding SNF claims meant to ensure that ACOs are being accurately and fairly held accountable for the care of their Medicare beneficiaries does not apply to FQHCs due to the their claim submission processes which are different than that of all other primary care providers. Since FQHCs do not use place of service codes or other indicators that a claim is eligible for exclusion, their claims are always considered primary care claims, even for SNF visits. These claims are then used for ACO beneficiary attribution and shared savings methodology, putting FQHC ACOs at an extreme disadvantage. CHCNI agrees with CMS's belief that it is important to exclude claims for FQHC and RHC services that include CPT codes 99304 through 99318 from use in assignment when there is a SNF facility claim with a date of service that overlaps with the date of FQHC or RHC services. Consistent with the previously established exclusion for claims billed under these codes when the services are provided to beneficiaries with an overlapping SNF stay, we believe it is important to exclude the same services from use in assignment when they are furnished by physicians and NPPs billing through an FQHC or RHC to beneficiaries in a SNF. CHCNI fully supports the proposed rule that would ensure parity between all ACOs participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program", "477": "[SPECIFICALLY MENTIONS QPP BUT COULD BE SSP AS WELL] Additionally, we are pleased that telehealth is further integrated into reporting and beneficiary assignment requirements in the Quality Payment Program. Telehealth will be particularly effective in value-based care arrangements as it can produce better outcomes at lower costs. While this rule focuses on fee-for-service Medicare, the ATA looks forward to continuing to work with CMS on transforming our system from one that rewards volume to one that rewards value, and we believe telehealth is an integral part of that effort.", "478": "1. Allow ACO-Participating TINs to individually submit Quality Reporting data rather than\nrequire the ACO to report on behalf of all participating TINS\n\nIn the proposed rule as written, CMS describes shifting ACOs away from Web Interface (WI) reporting\nto Electronic Clinical Quality Measures (\u201ceCQMs\u201d). The language in the proposed rule is unclear and\nimplies an ACO is expected to do the eCQM reporting on behalf of their participating TINs.\n\nACOs that are single TIN entities, or that all share the same instance of a single EMR, may be able to\nperform eCQM reporting at the ACO level. However, there are many ACOs that have successfully brought\ntogether independent entities to participate in the MSSP and that do not have the technological capability\nto do reporting at the ACO level for all their participating TINs.\n\nFor example, POM ACO will be comprised of more than 140 unique TINs spread across much of the\nlower peninsula of Michigan in 2021. Among those TINs, there are more than 20 unique EMRs in use.\n\nSince our inception, we have been distributing to our participants the ACO claims data CMS shares with\nus, and using that data to create insights about our patient\u2019s health and utilization patterns to enable us to\nimprove the manner in which care is delivered by our ACO participant providers. However, we have never\nbeen able to fully integrate clinical data from all participating TINs because of to the lack of true\ninteroperability across EMRs. And, even those TINs that have a common EMR vendor cannot truly share\ndata at the level necessary to do integrated eCQM reporting as described in the current proposed rule.\n\nIf CMS truly intends for ACOs to do eCQM reporting on behalf of their ACO participants, that plan would\ncreate significant hardship for ACOs structured like POM ACO. Imposing such requirements would force\nPOM ACO to hire a vendor at additional expense, fail quality reporting each year and accept the\nconsequences or abandon participation in the MSSP.\n\nOur first preference would be for CMS to continue supporting the Web Interface system. We recognize\nthe system is not perfect, and reporting quality through this system does create some additional work for\nACOs. However, the population we are measured on is obviously the patients we are accountable to in\nthe MSSP and the additional work involved is not overly burdensome.\n\nIf the Web Interface system is discontinued, we believe a more reasonable, and technologically feasible\napproach for CMS would be to allow each ACO-participating TIN to submit its individual eCQM data.\nCMS could then aggregate that data for each ACO to create an ACO quality score. If one or more ACOparticipating TINs do not submit the necessary data, CMS can devise a methodology to negatively adjust\nthe overall ACO score. This proposal would accommodate ACOs with participating TINs that use\ndifferent EMRs, while also not shifting or adding any burden back on single-TIN ACOs or single-EMR\nACOs.", "479": "2. If the Web Interface System is discontinued, delay the implementation of the proposed\nchanges to ACO Quality reporting until 2022\n\nOur first preference would be to continue allowing ACOs to report quality through the Web Interface\nSystem for the reasons described above.\n\nIf CMS chooses to discontinue Web Interface, we believe the timeline CMS has proposed to shift quality\nreporting to an eCQM based methodology is too aggressive and cannot be reasonably met by organizations\nnot already using eCQMs in an advanced manner.\n\nEven the most sophisticated TINs participating with POM ACO today have not built the programming\nnecessary in their EMRs to successfully report eCQM data to CMS nor to share it with POM ACO. Our\nsmallest and least resourced TINs may not even be reporting any eCQM data to CMS and may be\ncompletely at the mercy of their EMR vendor to make the programming changes necessary to be able to\nsubmit the required data to CMS and/or to POM ACO.\n\nFor every TIN, the amount of time, energy and money necessary to modify its EMR programming to meet\nthese proposed requirements will be different. By the time the proposed rule would be finalized, TINs and\nEMR vendors would be far behind the timelines necessary to complete, test, and validate the programming\nnecessary to successfully and confidently submit the necessary data to CMS or to their ACOs.", "480": "3. Allow ACO-Participating TINs to individually submit all necessary data for all components\nof the Alternative Payment Model Performance Pathway (APP) and create an ACO-wide\nscore rather than require ACOs to aggregate data and report on behalf of all participating\nTINs\n\nThroughout the proposed rule, CMS seems to draw a distinction between reporting done by ACOs and\nreporting done by ACO participants and ACO providers. This leads us to conclude that CMS expects\nACOs to be aggregating data for reporting that has not typically been the responsibility of ACOs and, as\nwe have described for Quality reporting above, may not always be possible or practical.\n\nWhile we strongly support CMS aligning reporting requirements for payment programs, we do not support\nplacing that reporting burden on ACOs. ACOs are often multi-TIN groups with disparate EMRs and\nwidely variable capabilities. There is no clear benefit to the MSSP\u2019s goals, or to patients, for ACOs to be\naggregating this data for submission to CMS. ACO\u2019s resources are better spent on improving care, care\ncoordination, and quality throughout their networks. These proposed data aggregation requirements do\nnot support those efforts. On the contrary, the proposed requirements would hinder ACO\u2019s care and\nquality improvement efforts by diverting scarce resources in order to meet reporting requirements.\n\nCMS is aggregating this data already, and could continue to aggregate the reporting done by ACOparticipating TINs in order to create ACO-wide scores for each MIPS category. Forcing ACOs to do this\ndata aggregation is duplicative and costly.", "481": "We appreciate that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has considered how to reduce the required number of\nmeasures, provide flexibility in how measures are submitted and mitigate potential reductions in\n2020 performance by using the higher of 2019 or 2020 scores. However, the timing of these\nchanges is very concerning as ACOs continue to deal with the uncertainty that the COVID-19 Public\nHealth Emergency (PHE) is bringing to the health care industry. Additionally, the expected delayed\nrelease of the final rule further reduces the amount of time ACOs and other Alternative Payment\nModels (APMs) will have to implement such changes.\n\n It is critical that CMS policies to evaluate ACO quality are fair, appropriate and accurately\nreflect the work ACOs engage in to improve patient care. CMS\u2019s proposals to change the way ACO\nquality is assessed, reported and scored for purposes of shared savings calculations are significant\nand more feedback should be collected before moving forward with such drastic changes. \n\nRemoval of the Web Interface Reporting Option\nCMS proposes to abruptly end the use of the Web Interface reporting mechanism, a tool that has \nbeen used since the MSSP\u2019s inception. Removing this option for all ACOs with no notice is ill timed\nand unfair. Further, CMS has not been clear regarding how the alternative MIPS reporting options\nwill be utilized for ACO entities specifically. There are several key questions and obstacles to moving\naway from this reporting method. For example, the current remaining MIPS reporting options\navailable under the Alternative Payment Model Performance Pathway (APP) would be registry\n(MIPS CQMs) and EHR (eCQMs). Using these reporting options would result in the ACO being\nevaluated on quality for all patients they serve, not only ACO assigned patients. This is not a true\nevaluation of the ACO\u2019s quality efforts and additionally, raises contractual and legal concerns as an\nACO may not have the ability to access patient data for non-ACO patients. It also greatly increases\nreporting burden because ACOs will now have to report on ALL patients regardless of payer, as\nopposed to a pre-defined set of patients.\nACOs use a variety of technology and infrastructure approaches for combining clinical data across\nthe ACO, such as using one EHR platform across all participating providers or combining clinical data\nextracts from participating clinicians. Recognizing the diversity of ACOs, we appreciate options for\nACOs to report quality measures. However, making the switch to these alternative reporting\noptions will cost many ACOs considerable time, money and effort in changing workflows, paying for\nregistries and adapting and modifying Electronic Health Records to comply with eCQM standards.\nFor these reasons, we urge CMS to provide a more gradual transition away from the use of the Web\nInterface reporting option to give more time and thought to how this will practically be\nimplemented and to give ACOs more time to assess their alternatives. At a minimum, the Web\nInterface must be continued for at least one additional year to give ACOs sufficient time to\nimplement a new reporting method.", "482": "Removing the Pay-for-Reporting year\nThe proposed rule would also remove the pay-for-reporting year currently provided to ACOs\nbeginning an initial MSSP contract as well as individual measures that are newly introduced to the\nmeasure set. It also would remove the ability of CMS to provide pay-for-reporting when measures\nundergo significant changes, such as guideline changes. We oppose CMS\u2019s proposal to remove payfor-reporting. Providing the pay-for-reporting year is critical to an ACO\u2019s success. This year allows an\nACO to evaluate their current workflows, data capture processes and other operational strategies\nto see where changes are needed and what areas to focus on. Further, providing a newly\nintroduced measure or a measure undergoing significant changes with a pay-for-reporting year\nensures there are no unintended consequences or flaws in the measure specifications before\nholding an ACO accountable for performance on the measure. Allowing this time to assess\nworkflows and operations before ACOs are held accountable for performance on measures allows\nACOs to be successful in getting credit for the good quality improvement work they are already\nengaged in, as often times a measure is not only assessing true quality but also how the quality data\nare captured.", "483": "APP Measure Set\nCMS also proposes significant changes to the quality measure set ACOs must report under the new\nAPP. While a reduction in measures is generally supported and may reduce reporting burdens, we\ndo not feel the current proposed APP measure set is appropriate and we instead urge CMS to take\nmore time to gather more stakeholder input, such as through a Request for Information (RFI) or\nopen stakeholder forum and seek feedback from the Measure Applications Partnership (MAP). The \nstatutory intent of the MAP was to evaluate quality measures to ensure the measures appropriately\nfit a program, and the MAP did not review these proposed changes in the 2019-2020 review cycle.", "484": "The AAN urges CMS to carefully consider policies that can aid small and solo practices in being\nsuccessful in the QPP, both during and after the PHE. CMS should also consider whether\nmodifications to the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy are necessary\nregardless of practice size, if the impacts of the PHE extend into 2021.", "485": "While we appreciate CMS\u2019s goal of aligning methodologies across programs, we do not support CMS proposals to make such sweeping changes to how ACO quality is assessed, how quality data is reported, and how ACOs are evaluated on quality for both the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) and Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). Further, these changes come amidst the unprecedented COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE). The timing of these changes is very concerning as ACOs continue to deal with the uncertainty that the COVID-19 PHE is bringing to the health care industry. At a minimum we urge CMS to postpone making any structural changes to the way ACO quality is assessed or reported until at least 2022. Finally, while these proposed changes align more with the way individual clinicians and groups are scored in MIPS, it is a farther departure from the way CMS assesses other non fee-for-service providers, such as Medicare Advantage. Therefore, this effort at alignment is a step backward for ACOs and those committed to value.\n\nQuality improvement is a cornerstone of the ACO model. In addition to reducing spending, ACOs must meet certain quality performance standards to be eligible to receive shared savings payments. ACOs continue to improve quality year over year, which improves patient care and helps to control costs. It is critical that CMS policies to evaluate ACO quality are fair, appropriate and accurately reflect the work ACOs undertake to improve patient care. CMS\u2019s proposals to change the way ACO quality is assessed, reported and scored for the purpose of shared savings calculation are significant and more feedback should be collected before moving forward with such drastic changes. Further, as stated in previous comments, NAACOS strongly believes ACOs should not be evaluated and assessed in the same manner as all other APMs or individual MIPS clinicians. ACOs are high-quality performers, however, this should not serve as a reason for CMS to overhaul the entire quality performance assessment approach for the MSSP. Instead, we urge CMS to work with NAACOS and other stakeholders to make changes to the current quality measure performance evaluation criteria and measure set for ACOs to further refine the measures and criteria as appropriate for a group of providers who are responsible for total cost of care for the populations they serve. Clinicians in MIPS who are not participating in total cost of care and full accountability payment models should not necessarily have the same quality measure set and scoring approach as ACOs. Likewise, each APM has specific goals and objectives, and the one size fits all approach under the proposed APP structure does not account for those differences.", "486": "The proposed six APP measures are a drastic reduction from the 23 measures ACOs are currently assessed on. While NAACOS supports reducing reporting burdens and efforts to eliminate low value measures, we feel these proposals go too far by reducing the number of clinical quality measures to a mere three measures. Quality improvement is a critical and core component of an ACO\u2019s work. We therefore recommend CMS consider maintaining several key clinical quality measures that are foundational to an ACO\u2019s quality improvement work and have been proven to improve outcomes including: ACO-14, Influenza Immunization; ACO-19, Colorectal Cancer Screening; ACO-20, Breast Cancer Screening; and the previously used Pneumonia Vaccination measure. While ACOs can choose to continue to work on these preventive measures whether or not they are included in the MSSP\u2019s official measure list, we think it is critical for CMS to evaluate both individual ACOs and the program as a whole on these foundational prevention measures. Further, since the ACO program already gives ACOs a direct financial incentive to reduce avoidable admissions and readmissions, we do not feel it is appropriate to have one third of the total measure set focused on utilization measures. We also urge CMS to do more comparative research on how ACO quality on these core measures and improvement areas contrasts to non-ACO quality and to make the data and research findings public. This type of comparison cannot fairly be done if ACOs are only measured on one diabetes measure, one blood pressure measure, and one depression screening measure as proposed in the APP, nor does it reflect the true purpose and work ACOs do in the quality improvement space.\n\nAdditionally, we have concerns with the Screening for Depression and Follow-Up Plan measure, as well as the Days at Home measure discussed but not formally proposed. Understanding the degree to which individuals spend their time at home is a useful indicator to determine if the healthcare system is achieving one of its primary goals. While this indicator provides a viewpoint broader than measures such as admissions or readmissions, the many different factors that can affect patients\u2019 \u201chealthy days at home\u201d raise serious concerns about whether differences in performance on this measure can be reliably attributed to the services delivered by ACOs and whether it would truly distinguish the quality of care ACO participants deliver. We also are concerned with the controlling high blood pressure measure in its current state, which determines performance based on a single reading rather than taking into account the level of control over a period of time. There are also limitations in accepting patient reported home readings that can be more reflective of true control of high blood pressure than office-based readings. Further, the MIPS Unplanned Admissions for Multiple Chronic Conditions measure does not meet the required 0.7 reliability threshold, and therefore we urge CMS to increase testing, particularly for risk adjustment, and increase case minimums for this measure before including it in the proposed APP measure set. Finally, the Unplanned Readmissions measure and CAHPS measures have very narrow bands, meaning very small differences in quality can result in very drastic quality score differences that are not meaningful and do not truly measure an ACO\u2019s quality improvement efforts. We recommend CMS work with stakeholders to make improvements to the specifications for these measures before using them as part of such a limited quality measure set as proposed in the APP.", "487": "Finally, while we support the inclusion of patient satisfaction measures, we have concerns that the number of CAHPS measures included in the APP is disproportionate to clinical quality and outcomes measures. There are several issues with the CAHPS measures as currently collected. As an example, the CAHPS measures use a very small sampling of patients and rely on patient recollection of experience that took place months prior. CMS should consider altering surveys to accept results from shorter surveys provided closer to real time and to a much larger population.", "488": "CMS proposes to abruptly end the use of the Web Interface reporting mechanism, a tool that has been used since the MSSP\u2019s inception. Removing this option for all ACOs with little notice is ill-timed and unfair. Further, CMS has not been clear regarding how the alternative MIPS reporting options will be utilized for ACOs (as APM Entities) specifically. There are several key questions and obstacles to moving away from this reporting method in this timeframe. For example, the current remaining MIPS reporting options available under the APP would be registry (MIPS CQMs) and EHR (eCQMs). Using these reporting options would result in the ACO being evaluated on quality for all patients the ACO\u2019s providers serve, not only ACO assigned patients. This is not a true evaluation of the ACO\u2019s quality efforts and, additionally, raises contractual and legal concerns, as an ACO may not have the ability to access patient data for non-ACO patients. This would also make quality evaluations challenging. In effect, assessing ACOs on their quality actions for all patients rather than ACO patients would be evaluating the ACO\u2019s spillover effects and would not directly evaluate the true impact of their work on their ACO patients. Further, a goal of APMs is to promote provider investment in processes and tools to improve outcomes. Many ACOs have invested significant resources for development of reporting processes and workflows to optimize this process; removing this option altogether would undermine these investments, thus diverting critical resources away from improving patient care.\n\nAdditionally, making the switch to these alternative reporting options will cost many ACOs considerable time, money and effort in changing workflows, paying for registries and adapting and modifying EHRs to comply with eCQM standards. As an example, some ACOs would need to pay large fees for modifying EHRs to capture the appropriate quality data and to change performance dashboards. These fees can be significant, and a large hardship particularly for smaller ACOs. Other ACOs may need to explore working with registries, which again, could come with additional fees to the ACO. For these reasons, we urge CMS to provide a more gradual transition away from the use of the Web Interface reporting option to give more time and thought to how this will practically be implemented and to give ACOs more time to assess their alternatives. While NAACOS supports the movement toward more automated reporting, the timeline CMS proposes is unreasonable and creates a hardship for ACOs. Specifically, we urge CMS to allow the Web Interface to be continued as an option for the foreseeable future while carefully considering additional reporting options for ACOs.\n\nFinally, moving to a registry or EHR-based reporting method will significantly increase the number of patients an ACO must report on and be evaluated on under CMS proposals. Currently, ACOs must report on 248 ACO patients included in the Web Interface. Under the registry option, an ACO would have to report on 60 percent of their patients, both Medicare and non-Medicare patients as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For the EHR reporting method, ACOs would be required to report on 70 percent of patients, both Medicare and non-Medicare as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For some ACOs this could be a drastic increase and will therefore add significant administrative burden for the ACO. Should CMS finalize this approach, the agency should be requiring the ACO to report on, at a maximum, 50 percent of exclusively ACO patients. These specification issues and differences demonstrate why NAACOS feels an ACO-tailored approach to quality measurement and assessment is more appropriate than trying to make the MIPS program and standards apply to ACOs. This will be increasingly important as NAACOS predicts many ACOs will not be able to meet the increasing QP thresholds in the coming years and will therefore find themselves subject to MIPS.", "489": "NAACOS opposes the proposal to remove the pay-for-reporting year currently provided to ACOs beginning an initial MSSP contract, as well as individual measures that are newly introduced to the measure set. This change would also remove the ability of CMS to provide a pay-for-reporting year when measures undergo significant changes, such as guideline and specification changes. Providing the pay-for-reporting year is critical to an ACO\u2019s success. This flexibility in scoring when a measure undergoes significant changes allows an ACO to evaluate their current workflows, data capture processes and other operational strategies to see where changes are needed and what areas to focus on. Further, providing a newly introduced measure with a pay-for-reporting year ensures there are no unintended consequences or flaws in the measure specifications before holding an ACO accountable for performance on the measure. Allowing this time to assess workflows and operations before ACOs are held accountable for performance on measures allows ACOs to be successful in getting credit for the good quality improvement work they are already engaged in, as often times a measure is not only assessing true quality but also how the quality data are captured. We urge CMS to not finalize this approach and instead maintain the pay-for-reporting year provided to ACOs in their initial contract year, as well as new quality measures when they are introduced or significantly changed. The current MIPS policy would allow for suppression of a measure that undergoes significant specification changes: under the proposed new APP scoring approach this would significantly disadvantage ACOs who could see drastic swings in their performance based on suppression of just one measure.\n\nAdditionally, NAACOS opposes the overall approach proposed for ACO quality scoring. With upcoming changes to MIPS through the MIPS Value Pathways and exemptions due to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as for COVID-19, the 40th percentile of the Quality Category score could vary greatly from year to year making it a less meaningful indicator of true performance. Instead, should CMS move forward with proposals to re-design the quality assessment structure for ACOs, we urge CMS to utilize a scoring approach that is more similar to the current domain-based scoring approach instead of using an all-or-nothing approach as proposed. As an example, CMS could instead consider a policy that would use a minimum attainment standard that requires 50 percent of the quality measures to meet or exceed the 40th percentile. This must be done in conjunction with our recommendations to add additional clinical quality measures to the measure set beyond the three that CMS has currently proposed. Setting the standard at 50 percent ensures that ACOs perform well on a substantial set of measures to earn savings but does not punish ACOs that miss the mark on a measure that is either not as relevant to their patient population or has a very narrow range of performance rates. Finally, NAACOS also urges CMS to better reward high quality performers, as is done in the Medicare Advantage program by providing bonuses or higher shared savings rates to high quality performers or those that notably improve quality scores over time.", "490": "Additionally, NAACOS opposes the overall approach proposed for ACO quality scoring.

While NAACOS prefers to see all measures reverted to pay-for-reporting in 2020, we support this alternative approach that will protect ACOs whose quality scores are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also pleased to see CMS remove the requirement for ACOs to field a CAHPS for ACOs survey in 2020 and provide full points automatically for each of the CAHPS survey measures. We urge CMS to finalize these proposals.

Given the vast changes proposed to the MSSP Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances policy over the last two years and the additional, alternative policies that have been put in place in 2019 and 2020 to account for COVID-19, CMS should refrain from making any significant changes to this policy at this time and continue to assess the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 before making any further changes to the established policy. As noted above, we also urge CMS to begin considering alternative policies for 2021 due to COVID-19 for both financial and quality assessments for ACOs. As noted above, we do not support CMS proposals to change ACO quality assessments, and therefore we also do not support the proposed changes to the MSSP Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Policy to align with the new APP proposals.", "495": "As noted above, we urge CMS to keep in place the current measure set, reporting mechanism and scoring methods for ACO quality in 2021. Therefore, we support CMS proposals to add denominator exclusions for advanced illness and frailty for the breast cancer and colorectal cancer screening measures, as previously advocated for by NAACOS. These important exclusions will ensure unnecessary care is not provided to patients with advanced illness. Additionally, NAACOS supports updates to specifications to add telehealth encounters as eligible encounters, however, we note that certain measures do not list these changes as applicable when reporting via the Web Interface. CMS should clarify that all specification updates will apply regardless of reporting method and including measures reported via Web Interface. CMS should also clarify the proposed changes to the influenza immunization measure. CMS notes a qualifying encounter must occur between January 1 and March 31, 2021 for the 2020 timeframe. For the 2021 timeframe CMS notes the qualifying encounter must occur between October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. This is a significant change, or an error. Instead we urge CMS to clarify the 2021-2022 qualifying timeframe is at a minimum between September 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 in order to capture those that receive their flu shot in September, and we urge CMS to capture the entire flu season as has been the case in the past, looking at September 2021 through March 2022. Additionally, needing an in-person encounter for the flu shot during a predefined timeframe is not practical, whether it is a telehealth encounter or in-person encounter. Many patients will receive the flu shot at a pharmacy, where there is a Part B charge but not an encounter. These patients receiving flu shots in the pharmacy setting should meet the measure criteria as well.", "496": "We do not support CMS making further changes to the MSSP Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances policy at this time.

We appreciate CMS\u2019s efforts to minimize burdens associated with the repayment mechanism. Currently, a renewing ACO that wants to use its existing repayment mechanism in the subsequent agreement period is required to maintain a higher repayment mechanism amount than necessary for its new agreement period if the repayment mechanism amount for the last performance year of the previous agreement period is greater than what is needed for the subsequent agreement period. We support CMS\u2019s proposal to eliminate this requirement and recommend it be finalized.", "498": "We thank CMS for taking action to provide more flexibility to ACOs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We strongly support the option provided to ACOs with agreements ending December 31, 2020, to extend their agreements for an additional performance year and appreciate the agency clarifying that this policy also applies to Track 1+ ACOs. This will provide much needed stability for ACOs in an uncertain time.", "499": "NAACOS supports updating the definition of primary care codes used for MSSP assignment. Assignment is a critical program methodology that determines the beneficiary population for which an ACO is held accountable. Adding codes such as \u201ce-visits,\u201d chronic care management, and principal care management will help create a better picture of where patients receive most of their primary care. CMS should continue to refine the primary care codes used in assignment, and we request that the agency do so in a timely manner. We recommend CMS finalize adding the nine proposed codes to the MSSP assignment methodology.\nNAACOS also appreciates CMS\u2019s desire to ensure that patients are attributed to providers from whom they receive their primary care services. Therefore, we support excluding advance care planning services from MSSP assignment when billed in an inpatient setting and also excluding professional services furnished by FQHCs or RHCs when delivered in a SNF. Both of these changes, while technical in nature, help create more complete and accurate patient assignment lists for ACOs and we recommend the agency finalize these proposals.\nWhile NAACOS appreciates CMS\u2019s work to refine assignment during the COVID-19 PHE, NAACOS recommends that CMS use a two-year assignment window for MSSP to account for potential variations in attribution in 2020 and 2021. Especially in states hit harder by the pandemic, healthy patients may forego routine primary care and throw off assignment for MSSP ACOs who use either retrospective or prospective attribution. Therefore, patient visits from 2019 and 2020 should be considered for ACOs\u2019 assignment lists regardless if ACOs choose prospective attribution or retrospective attribution. While the windows for either groups of ACOs will be different, the same general principle applies and would help create more steady and accurate assignment lists. The Next Generation ACO Model uses a two-year assignment window already.", "500": "To date, however, CMS has limited telehealth waivers in ACOs, including MSSP and related CMS Innovation Center models, to patients\u2019 geographic location and originating site, allowing telehealth to be delivered to patients outside of rural settings and in their homes. Instead, NAACOS urges that CMS use its statutory authority under 42 U.S.C. 1315a(d)(1) (in the case of CMMI models) and 42 U.S.C. 1395jjj(f) (in the case of MSSP) to allow all ACOs, regardless of risk level or choice of attribution, the freedom to use telehealth in broader circumstances. This includes expanding waivers beyond the patient\u2019s site of care and geographic location.\nSpecifically, CMS should provide ACOs access to a broader set of telehealth waivers and expand what telehealth waivers cover, for example, waiving patient cost-sharing, additional modalities like telephone-only, supervision allowances, waivers on the frequency of telehealth visits, and covered services, such as those CMS says need some level of in-person care delivered in conjunction with telehealth. ACOs should be allowed greater freedoms to see patients \u2014 attributed through either prospective assignment or preliminary prospective assignment \u2014 without requirements on needing a corresponding in-person visit within a specified period of time after the telehealth visit. In the remote monitoring space, CMS could allow ACOs to monitor patient health for shorter periods of time and wider sets of clinical circumstances, as the agency seeks comment on elsewhere in the proposed rule. Because ACOs take accountability for a patient population, CMS should grant them the tools to care for those populations in ways that they see best, and waivers shouldn\u2019t be limited to patients\u2019 geographic location and originating site. Enacting these changes would achieve a dual purpose of expanding the reach of telehealth \u2014 with the access to care and quality improvement it brings \u2014 along with enticing more providers to join value-based payment models like ACOs.", "501": "CMS proposes to allow individual clinicians and group TINs the option of choosing to report outside the ACO for purposes of MIPS analysis. Should a practice or clinician choose this option, it would be required to select the appropriate measures and reporting method and report separately from the ACO for purposes of MIPS scoring. In this case, these clinicians/groups would only be provided with 50 percent automatic credit for improvement activities (while ACOs are awarded with full points automatically for this performance category). CMS would then award clinicians with the higher of their own scores or the ACO\u2019s score for MIPS.\n\nComments: NAACOS has concerns that this policy would allow certain organizations to select measures for which they have the highest historical performance, not allowing for a true and fair assessment of quality improvement efforts. Additionally, this could cause more complexity and confusion to an already very complicated process. We instead urge CMS to maintain the APM Scoring Standard approach, under which ACOs would be evaluated on MSSP quality measures for MIPS.", "502": "Under the Pathways to Success regulations when a recalculated repayment mechanism increases by a certain amount (i.e., the lesser of 50 percent or $1,000,000), CMS requires the ACO to increase the value of the repayment mechanism. However, CMS does not currently decrease the repayment mechanism amount when the opposite occurs, a policy for which NAACOS has advocated and which the agency proposes to change in this rule. We appreciate CMS\u2019s proposal to allow ACOs an option to decrease their repayment mechanism amount if the recalculated amount is less than the current amount, and we request the agency finalize this policy. We also support CMS providing an opportunity for ACOs that renewed their agreements effective in 2019 or 2020 an opportunity to benefit from this policy change, if finalized, by adjusting their repayment mechanism amounts already in place, if they quality under the revised policy.", "503": "We support CMS\u2019s proposals in the rule, but we also urge the agency to take additional steps to minimize burdens associated with repayment mechanism requirements. Many ACOs cite the burden and cost of securing a repayment mechanism as reasons not to move to a risk-based ACO model. Instead of requiring a repayment mechanism that pays banks and brokers and takes money away from the ACO executing its core mission of improving patient care, we urge CMS to remove the repayment mechanism requirement when an ACO can prove that it has an investor or financial backer with a demonstrated high credit rating. Financial backers could include outside investors, insurers or hospitals or health systems that are involved with the ACO and providing financial support, which would be available should losses occur. This assurance would protect the Medicare Trust Fund in the event the ACO has losses while avoiding the financial inefficiency and regulatory burden of involving outside financial institutions as third parties that benefit from the repayment mechanism requirements. This would also eliminate the need to have a 24-month tail period. The additional burden of a 24-month \u201ctail period\u201d heightens concerns and increases financial requirements for ACOs. Should CMS maintain requirements for a repayment mechanism, we request the agency to minimize this regulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for tail period coverage, which is especially important considering the longer agreement periods", "504": "We appreciate that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has considered how to reduce the required number of\nmeasures, provide flexibility in how measures are submitted and mitigate potential reductions in\n2020 performance by using the higher of 2019 or 2020 scores. However, the timing of these\nchanges is very concerning as ACOs continue to deal with the uncertainty that the COVID-19 Public\nHealth Emergency (PHE) is bringing to the health care industry. Additionally, the expected delayed\nrelease of the final rule further reduces the amount of time ACOs and other Alternative Payment\nModels (APMs) will have to implement such changes.\n\n It is critical that CMS policies to evaluate ACO quality are fair, appropriate and accurately\nreflect the work ACOs engage in to improve patient care. CMS\u2019s proposals to change the way ACO\nquality is assessed, reported and scored for purposes of shared savings calculations are significant\nand more feedback should be collected before moving forward with such drastic changes. \n\nRemoval of the Web Interface Reporting Option\nCMS proposes to abruptly end the use of the Web Interface reporting mechanism, a tool that has \nbeen used since the MSSP\u2019s inception. Removing this option for all ACOs with no notice is ill timed\nand unfair. Further, CMS has not been clear regarding how the alternative MIPS reporting options\nwill be utilized for ACO entities specifically. There are several key questions and obstacles to moving\naway from this reporting method. For example, the current remaining MIPS reporting options\navailable under the Alternative Payment Model Performance Pathway (APP) would be registry\n(MIPS CQMs) and EHR (eCQMs). Using these reporting options would result in the ACO being\nevaluated on quality for all patients they serve, not only ACO assigned patients. This is not a true\nevaluation of the ACO\u2019s quality efforts and additionally, raises contractual and legal concerns as an\nACO may not have the ability to access patient data for non-ACO patients. It also greatly increases\nreporting burden because ACOs will now have to report on ALL patients regardless of payer, as\nopposed to a pre-defined set of patients.\nACOs use a variety of technology and infrastructure approaches for combining clinical data across\nthe ACO, such as using one EHR platform across all participating providers or combining clinical data\nextracts from participating clinicians. Recognizing the diversity of ACOs, we appreciate options for\nACOs to report quality measures. However, making the switch to these alternative reporting\noptions will cost many ACOs considerable time, money and effort in changing workflows, paying for\nregistries and adapting and modifying Electronic Health Records to comply with eCQM standards.\nFor these reasons, we urge CMS to provide a more gradual transition away from the use of the Web\nInterface reporting option to give more time and thought to how this will practically be\nimplemented and to give ACOs more time to assess their alternatives. At a minimum, the Web\nInterface must be continued for at least one additional year to give ACOs sufficient time to\nimplement a new reporting method.", "505": "Removing the Pay-for-Reporting year\nThe proposed rule would also remove the pay-for-reporting year currently provided to ACOs\nbeginning an initial MSSP contract as well as individual measures that are newly introduced to the\nmeasure set. It also would remove the ability of CMS to provide pay-for-reporting when measures\nundergo significant changes, such as guideline changes. We oppose CMS\u2019s proposal to remove payfor-reporting. Providing the pay-for-reporting year is critical to an ACO\u2019s success. This year allows an\nACO to evaluate their current workflows, data capture processes and other operational strategies\nto see where changes are needed and what areas to focus on. Further, providing a newly\nintroduced measure or a measure undergoing significant changes with a pay-for-reporting year\nensures there are no unintended consequences or flaws in the measure specifications before\nholding an ACO accountable for performance on the measure. Allowing this time to assess\nworkflows and operations before ACOs are held accountable for performance on measures allows\nACOs to be successful in getting credit for the good quality improvement work they are already\nengaged in, as often times a measure is not only assessing true quality but also how the quality data\nare captured.", "506": "APP Measure Set\nCMS also proposes significant changes to the quality measure set ACOs must report under the new\nAPP. While a reduction in measures is generally supported and may reduce reporting burdens, we\ndo not feel the current proposed APP measure set is appropriate and we instead urge CMS to take\nmore time to gather more stakeholder input, such as through a Request for Information (RFI) or\nopen stakeholder forum and seek feedback from the Measure Applications Partnership (MAP). The \nstatutory intent of the MAP was to evaluate quality measures to ensure the measures appropriately\nfit a program, and the MAP did not review these proposed changes in the 2019-2020 review cycle.", "507": "We do not support CMS proposal to change the policy to give ACOs that report the higher of their own score or the 40th percentile Quality Performance Category score of all MIPS reporters or to give ACOs that do not report the 40th percentile score. We believe CMS should maintain the existing policy of using the mean ACO score in place of the 40th percentile score. ACOs have typically outperformed many other MIPS reporters and using the 40th percentile score for those ACOs that are affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance is likely to give ACOs a much lower score than they might have earned outside of those unique circumstances.", "508": "[Not directly on this topic, but we thought it was important for DAFDA to review. We can recategorize if needed.]\nWe urge CMS to exclude MIPS bonuses as ACO expenditures under the MSSP shared savings and losses methodology. When ACO-attributed patients receive services from providers that have earned positive MIPS adjustments, it decreases the ACO\u2019s ability to generate savings. The effect of the current policy will become increasingly significant over time as MIPS adjustments rise in future program years. The current CMS policy creates misalignment between the goals of MIPS and MSSP. The better an ACO and its eligible clinicians perform in MIPS, the more challenging it will become to earn shared savings under MSSP. We strongly encourage CMS to amend the current methodology to exclude these payment adjustments.", "509": "We support CMS\u2019 proposed change to not require ACOs to administer the CAHPS for ACOs Survey for PY 2020 and to give all ACOs automatic full credit on all CAHPS measures. Should the COVID-19 pandemic extend for a significant portion of 2021, we recommend that CMS consider applying this change to PY 2021 as well.", "510": "We strongly support the alternative modification that CMS is considering to give ACOs that report quality for PY 2020, the higher of their PY 2019 or PY 2020 quality score. We believe this approach will encourage ACOs to report quality and do what they can to improve quality performance scores while also acknowledging the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and its likely effect on quality of care for reasons that are largely outside of an ACO\u2019s ability to control. We recommend CMS consider extending this approach to PY 2021 as well (i.e., that ACOs receive the higher of their PY 2021 or PY 2019 score).", "511": "[Intro paragraph applies to several 'entries'] We appreciate CMS\u2019 interest in reducing burden and simplifying quality measurement for ACOs. While we agree that using a single methodology to measure quality performance under both MSSP and MIPS would have benefits in terms of simplicity, we are not in favor of CMS replacing the MSSP quality scoring with the APP at this time. We believe there are still a variety of policies and operational details that need to be  worked out and more clearly communicated to ACOs before making these substantial changes. CMS noted in its decision to delay implementation of the MIPS Value Pathways that, \u201cWe want to move forward with the transformation of the MIPS program in a manner that does not take away from the nation\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d (85 FR 50277). We believe the same should apply to MSSP ACOs, many of whom have been and continue to be at the forefront of caring for our most vulnerable patients during the pandemic. We strongly encourage CMS to delay implementation of the APP for MSSP ACOs\n\nMeasure Set and Reporting Mechanisms\nWe appreciate CMS\u2019 efforts to reduce provider burden in quality reporting. We believe CMS has made good\nprogress in moving to a more focused measure set since the beginning of the Program. We believe, however, that the current proposal to reduce the measure set for ACOs from 23 to 6 measures, goes too far and would not allow for a robust assessment of clinical quality. It is critical to continue assessing the quality of care provided to patients attributed to ACOs and we support the inclusion of a broader measure set in doing so.\nSpecifically, we would recommend that, outside of the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS continue to measure ACOs on breast cancer and colorectal cancer screening rates and influenza vaccination. To the extent possible, we recommend that CMS make use of claims data, including CPT 2 codes to determine performance on these and other measures with an opportunity for ACOs to provide supplemental data to fill in gaps not captured by claims. This would reduce burden but give insight into ACO performance on key clinical metrics. Additionally, In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommend that CMS either remove or make certain measures such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer screening pay for reporting for performance years 2020 and 2021.\nWe also have concerns about CMS transitioning away from the CMS Web Interface at this time. The proposed measure set would have ACOs reporting via eCQMs or MIPS CQMs and we do not have clarity about how that reporting would occur at the ACO level. We would like clarity from CMS about how ACOs that include practices with multiple EMRs, would report via eCQMs. Specifically, would separate reporting occur for each EMR? Would ACOs only be reporting on attributed MSSP patients or on all patients regardless of attribution or payer status? While we appreciate that eCQMs have the potential to reduce reporting burden in the longterm, we are concerned that the lack of uniformity in how different EMR vendors interpret measure specifications may result in unreliable results that would not allow for accurate comparisons between ACOs. \nWe recommend that CMS continue to use the CMS Web Interface for ACO reporting at this time.\n\n\u2026.\nWe do not support a change to the APP for MSSP ACOs beginning in PY2021. We have concerns about a variety of the proposed changes including the measure set and reporting mechanisms and given those and COVID-19, we recommend delaying this transition and keeping the MIPS APM Scoring Standard and the CMS Web Interface reporting mechanism in place for MSSP ACOs for PY2021. Please see our comments on the Medicare Shared Savings Program for more details on our questions and concerns.", "512": "We do not support CMS\u2019 proposal to change the Quality Performance Standard to the 40th percentile of the Quality Performance Category Score for all MIPS reporters. We believe it is important for ACOs to know ahead of time, what standard needs to be met. Using a standard that is dependent on performance year data and subject to changes in MIPS requirements and performance, would not provide ACOs with a clear\nindication ahead of the performance year of what they need to attain to earn shared savings. In the proposed rule, CMS states that their intent is to increase the quality performance standard over time but it is not clear that this change will achieve that goal. The 40th percentile score of all MIPS reporters could be a higher or lower standard than the current standard. With upcoming changes to MIPS through the MIPS Value Pathways and exemptions due to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as COVID-19, the 40th percentile of the Quality Category score could vary greatly from year to year making it a less meaningful indicator of true performance. As an alternative, CMS could set the threshold to require ACOs to meet or exceed the 40th percentile benchmark score on at least 50 percent of all measures, rather than looking at the overall Performance Category score for all MIPS reporters. We recommend this alternative in combination with expanding the set of measures beyond the six that were proposed. Additionally, outside of the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, benchmarks should always be released ahead of time to ensure that ACOs know what standard they need to meet to share in savings. We believe this approach would serve CMS\u2019 goal of increasing the standard, while providing ACOs with a more reliable minimum target that they know ahead of the performance period. This approach would also be less arbitrary than using the quality performance category score because it would be specific to the measures that ACOs report. We note that it is critical that there be a sufficient set of measures on which to assess ACOs if using this approach. Setting the standard at 50 percent, ensures that ACOs perform well on a substantial set of measures to earn savings but does not punish ACOs that miss the mark on a measure that is either not as relevant to their patient population or has a very narrow range of performance rates.\n\nAdditionally, we note that CMS is proposing to remove the pay for reporting year for new ACOs. While we understand that CMS wants to raise the standard for ACOs, we believe that the pay for reporting year can be helpful in reducing barriers to new entrants into the program and we encourage CMS to consider retaining\nthis pay for reporting year to make the program appealing to new entrants so that more providers are encouraged to join. More importantly than the pay for reporting year, however, is the MSSP policy of making a quality measure pay for reporting when it is newly introduced into the program. We believe this is critical in giving ACOs time to adjust to the new measure specifications and to allowing CMS to collect sufficient baseline data to set a benchmark.", "513": "We do not support CMS\u2019 proposal that ACOs that meet the quality performance standard would earn the maximum amount of shared savings. We believe there is value in encouraging improvement on quality measures beyond the minimum and that ACOs that perform better on quality should be rewarded with a higher savings percentage. We recommend that CMS keep the existing policy for incorporating quality performance into earned shared savings calculations", "514": "Comments on Changes to Accountable Care Organization (ACO) Scoring and Policies\n\nWe support the Proposed Rule\u2019s changes to ensure greater alignment and integration\nbetween QPP and the Shared Savings Program, including revising the Shared Savings\nProgram\u2019s Performance Year 2021 quality performance standard. This proposed\nrevision would align the Shared Savings Program\u2019s quality performance standard with\nthe QPP\u2019s proposed Alternative Payment Model (APM) Performance Pathway (APP), as\nparticipants in the Shared Savings Program would be required to report quality for\npurposes of the Shared Savings Program via APP. The idea of APP replacing the current\nShared Savings Program quality measure set to streamline reporting requirements for\nShared Savings Program ACOs would reduce reporting burden, create new scoring\nopportunities for participants in MIPS APMs, encourage more participation in APMs, and\nserve as a suitable complementary path to the MVP Program.\n\nOverall, streamlining quality reporting requirements under the Shared Savings\nProgram\u2014while maintaining alignment with QPP\u2014will help ACOs, as well as their\nparticipating providers and suppliers, dedicate limited resources toward improving\nquality and reducing costs for their assigned beneficiary population. Such efforts allow\nACOs to better focus on increasing the value of healthcare and improving care, all\nwhile reducing burden, since ACOs would be able to track a smaller set of measures\nunder a unified scoring methodology.", "515": "To date, CMS has not discussed digital health tools\u2019 key role in the success of APMs\nwhich should have the flexibility to use connected health technologies for patients with\nspecific at-risk chronic conditions. For example, the Medicare Shared Savings Program,\nby far Medicare\u2019s largest APM, CMS only waives patient location and geographic\nlimitations on accountable care organizations (ACOs) that are at financial risk and use\nprospective assignment. There also haven\u2019t been case studies on ACOs\u2019 use of RPM.\nIn order to help providers utilizing APMs meet statutory requirements to reduce total\ncosts, CMS should exercise its statutory authority under 42 U.S.C. 1315a(d)(1) (in the\ncase of CMMI Models) and 42 U.S.C. 1395jjj(f) (in the case of the Medicare Shared\nSavings Program) to waive payment and program requirements as appropriate.\nSpecifically, CMS should allow wider use of telehealth in the Shared Savings Program\nby allowing all ACOs access to telehealth waivers and expand what telehealth waivers\ncover, for example, to include patient cost-sharing, modalities, and covered services.", "516": "We understand CMS\u2019s desire to align the MSSP quality requirements with the MIPS Quality requirements. While we support the CMS proposal, we have concerns with the timing and the potential burden that will be created by requiring some of the new measures CMS has proposed. We ask CMS to delay the removal of the current quality measures for the MSSP ACO program until 2022. We believe that ACOs and their participants will need additional time to identify if they should move forward with a collection type of a Qualified Registry, eCQMs, or a hybrid collection and submission type. Either reporting option may present costs and implementation effort to the ACO and its participants. We also have concerns about the potential collection efforts for the new measures that may increase burden on ACOs and their participants. Currently, ACOs reporting measures through the CMS Web Interface only report on beneficiaries that are assigned to the ACO. Under the current proposal, CMS would require ACOs to report on the same six measures as are proposed to be required under the APM Performance Pathway (APP) for MIPS. Of the six measures that CMS is proposing to require, three of them can be collected and reported using either the Qualified Registry or eCQM collection and submission types. As a vendor of both, we understand that both sets of measures typically require reporting on all payers for 100% of beneficiaries. This would be a substantial shift in the reporting requirements creating a potential burden on ACOs. Another concern is that ACOs have a variety of participants, from a variety of venues, on a variety of systems. It may be very difficult for ACOs and their participants to gather the necessary information across these systems.", "517": "We understand the efficiency and savings that could be created for CMS by eliminating the CMS Web Interface collection and submission type. We have some questions on the transition of the measures for ACOs from the currently required measures to the newly required measures under the APP framework. We review those questions in the MSSP ACO section above and will not repeat them here. We recommend that CMS delay the removal of the CMS Web Interface collection and submission type for both the MSSP ACOs and the MIPS Quality Performance category until the 2022 performance year. While many of the groups of ECs that rely on the CMS Web Interface collection and submission type are in an ACO (either MSSP or Next Gen), not all of them are which is why we are repeating our request to delay the removal of this collection and submission option from 2021 to 2022 performance year. These ECs and EC Groups need time to find other reporting options and other appropriate measures. This is especially true now with the move to the MVP framework which is still not fully defined and outlined. These groups may be forced to move to a new collection/submission type and settle on quality measures for the 2021 performance year only to have that shift again under the MVP framework. We ask that CMS ease the confusion and burden by simply waiting a year to remove the CMS Web Interface option so that the groups will at least have an opportunity to learn more about potential MVP impact and work with potential third-party intermediaries to contract and identify appropriate measures for reporting. Many organizations that have opted into this reporting method for MIPS have chosen this option due to the use of multiple disparate EHR systems, and the web interface offers a cost-effective option for reporting for those TINs. Additionally, most ACOs include participants that are using different EHR systems. Moving away from the web interface will require contracts with registry or eCQM vendors to aggregate data across these disparate systems. In some cases, this may require contracts with multiple vendors. Aside from the cost and burden on providers, vendors need adequate lead time to update systems and handle the wave of new ECs/EC groups and data sources to onboard as previous web interface users transition to new vendors. For ACOs specifically, additional time is needed for vendors to update configuration tools and measure algorithms to aggregate data at an ACO level, as contributing data from the ACO can come from varying billing organizations/TINs. We also understand from some of our ACO clients that they will likely require revised participation agreements to access and report on data across all payers from their ACO participants, as they are currently only authorized to review and report data on Medicare beneficiaries aligned to the ACO. This may cause a delay in reporting vendors having access to all data necessary to report. All of these points will prevent vendors in these scenarios from providing performance data early enough in the measurement period to allow for outreach and improvement.", "518": "We strongly support CMS\u2019 goals of incentivizing value-base care and driving the Medicare system to greater value and quality. However, the removal of the \u201cphase in\u201d for quality reporting could prove detrimental to new ACOs. While reducing the reporting requirements from 10 measures to 3 decreases some of the burden on an ACO, there are many operational and compliance hurdles a new ACO must overcome before feeling confident that they can meet the pay-forperformance standards. For 2021 and future performance years, CMS should continue the phase-in approach to quality reporting for new ACOs. New ACOs in their first performance year should meet the quality performance standard at the level of full and complete reporting (pay-for-reporting) rather than pay-for-performance. The first performance year serves as an opportunity for an ACO to build its operations and evaluate the effectiveness. This is especially true for quality reporting. In preparation for quality reporting, ACOs must educate all participating providers and staff on how to completely and accurately document quality measures, determine a process by which to abstract the quality data timely and securely from practices, accurately and completely submit the data within the appropriate tool, and develop a quality assurance process to ensure beneficiary medical records support the quality data entry. These operational hurdles may not be overwhelming for a single TIN ACO built on a strong technological foundation with a single Electronic Medical Record system, but ACOs comprised of multiple TINs with solo practitioners need the opportunity to build and test their process before possibly being penalized. The payfor-reporting year allows ACOs an opportunity to experience quality reporting, identify any issues or concerns, conduct an internal quality measures validation audit, and streamline the process prior to meeting pay-for-performance quality standards. We believe the removal of the pay-for-reporting quality performance standard is likely to deter participation in the Medicare Shared Savings Program and adversely impact ACOs comprised of smaller physician practices vs those supported by large hospital systems and management service organizations. The loss of smaller practices, and the unique perspective they provide, would be a detriment to the model as a whole", "519": "We strongly support the CMS proposal for a new approach to monitor for, and address, an ACO\u2019s continued noncompliance with the applicable quality performance standard for performance years beginning on or after January 1, 2021.

CMS is proposing a new APM Performance Pathway (APP) reporting option in 2021 to align with the MVP framework. As part of the APP introduction, CMS will be sunsetting the CMS Web Interface as a collection type beginning in the 2021 performance period. While this change will significantly reduce the number of measures required to be reported by ACOs participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program, as well as groups and virtual groups that report through the CMS Web Interface, it will also require these groups to report on a larger pool of patients (70% of all patients versus the 248 Medicare patients included in the CMS Web Interface), include non-Medicare patients, and adopt new reporting mechanisms for quality reporting with which they may not be as familiar (i.e. QCDR/registry or EHR). APM entities do not necessarily share an EHR, especially ACOs. This factor is typically less of a problem if an entity is reporting on less than 250 patients; however, the requirement for reporting on 70% of a large ACO\u2019s patients would likely require synchronization of EHRs to capture the same measures and consolidate data. We appreciate the agency\u2019s arguments for the sunsetting of the Web Interface, including the decrease in users over time and the expense of continuing the Web Interface for a decreasing number of users. However, the agency acknowledges that the loss of approximately 80% of current users in 2021 would be due to the agency\u2019s own proposed requirements that ACOs must begin reporting through the APP in 2021 and would thus be terminated from the interface due to the new policy, with no other option provided. In such a scenario, rather than an abrupt termination of the Web Interface, we would encourage CMS to continue this reporting mechanism for an additional year to allow for a transition period for those practices to prepare for a new reporting mechanism; we believe this flexibility to be especially important during a pandemic when resources are already stretched thin.\n\nASCO encourages CMS to allow for a transition year from the APM scoring standard to the MIPS scoring standard for MIPS APMs. CMS is continuing to allow MIPS eligible clinicians (ECs) to participate in MIPS as individuals or as part of a group or virtual group and is expanding the use of the APM Entity submitter type to allow the use of all MIPS submission mechanisms. In past years, MIPS ECs participating in MIPS APMs were required to participate in MIPS through their APM Entity for scoring under the APM Scoring Standard. CMS is proposing to end the APM Scoring Standard beginning with the 2021 performance period. Additionally, CMS is proposing to add the APM Entity as a submitter type which may report to MIPS on behalf of associated MIPS eligible clinicians. The APM Entity would be defined by the Participation List or Affiliated Practitioner list of the applicable MIPS APM. The APM Entity would be able to report on the Quality and Improvement Activities performance categories. Quality measures could be selected and reported in the same manner and using the same options that are available to all other MIPS eligible clinicians, or could be reported through the APP. The Cost category would also be scored for APM Entities that do not report through the APP. When an APM Entity chooses to report to MIPS, CMS would generally calculate a Promoting Interoperability performance category score for the APM Entity group.

Due to\nthe broad impact of COVID-19 on care delivery, the ACC requests that CMS consider flexibility for all\nparticipants regardless of the number of COVID-19 cases treated.\n\nThe uncertainty of defining a timeline for the COVID-19 crisis continues to be a concern for the ACC for\nseveral reasons. First, while the federal government may lift its current emergency declaration, several\nstates may continue to keep policies in place to slow the spread of the virus at the regional level.\nApplying the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy uniformly to all participants nationwide\nuntil the end of the performance year would prevent the need for CMS to later modify the program on\na regional basis.

The ACC also\nacknowledges CMS\u2019 proposal to \u201cdetermine the percentage of the ACO\u2019s performance year assigned\nbeneficiary population that was affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstances based on the\nquarter four list of assigned beneficiaries, rather than the list of assigned beneficiaries used to\ngenerate the Web Interface quality reporting sample, which is currently used.\u201d\n\nHowever, the College believes that it is difficult to calculate who exactly is affected by COVID19 and that the beneficiary attribution definition should cover a wider range of patients. At the\nbeginning of the pandemic, the key areas that were harder hit and the hospitals that were inundated\nwith COVID-19 make it more difficult to determine what percentage of the population was affected. In\nthese circumstances, almost 100 percent of the patient population was affected by the pandemic,\nwhether due to the virus itself, practices put in place to ensure social distancing, or patient fear of\nseeking care. Additionally, during the months of March and April 2020, many of these hospitals did not\nhave access to widespread testing so there were a higher number of presumed COVID cases.

However, the ACC asks that CMS consider the impact of the COVID-19 PHE on\nthe timing of implementation for MSSP ACOs and offer a similar voluntary transition period.\nThe phase-in for voluntary participants will allow entities to implement a new reporting mechanism\nwith the elimination of the web interface and provide a year of data collection so that sites can assess\ntheir performance against the consolidated core measure set. Applying a phase-in period for all APM\nparticipants would also protect entities against any potential negative impacts experienced due to the\nCOVID-19 PHE.

My ACO and I would like to strongly support the component of CMS 1734-P which seeks to make permanent PHE-related temporary rules regarding Telehealth services. We have utilized relaxation of the rules governing telehealth services and improving reimbursement to greatly enhance access of our seniors to our health system. Many remain concerned about visiting a health care facility and thus feel much more comfortable receiving health care services from the safety of their homes. Those seniors who are not particularly facile with IT/remote connectivity often rely on friends and relatives who have more than happy to assist. This has been particularly beneficial for delivering Transitional Care Management (TCM) services as seniors are especially desirous of staying in the perceived safety of their homes in the early post discharge period. These virtual visits can be crucial in decreasing readmissions. Some seniors have limited electronic access issues (e.g. no smartphone, no computer) and thus only have audio access to us. Others in more rural areas do not have adequate connectivity to permit video visits. Therefore, I would suggest that providers providing audio-only visits be reimbursed the same as or close to the same as for audio-visual visits if it is documented in the medical record that audio is the only option for that particular Medicare beneficiary. Overall, the increased utilization of telemedicine prompted by the PHE has been one of the silver linings on this COVID cloud.

Telehealth allows patients to be seen when patients are unwilling or unable to get to the physicians office. Patients often cancel due to transportation or weather concerns prior to COVID restrictions. Now many patients are afraid to leave their house and foregoing routine following care and at times acute care needs. Telehealth visits also help with follow-up care. I can easily see my patients for simple routine care such as diabetes f/u or depression f/u via Telehealth. This increases compliance with f/u and with better adherence to medication regimens by allowing more frequent discussion between patients and providers. I implore you to continue payments for this service."}
