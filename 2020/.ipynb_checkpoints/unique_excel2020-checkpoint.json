We urge CMS not to implement changes to the quality program until a future performance year and continue to work with ACOs to adapt the quality measurement and assessment process. These changes are significant and touch every aspect of quality improvement efforts from reporting quality data, tracking measure performance, and how ACOs are evaluated and scored for both the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) and Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). There are multiple concerns with the proposed ACO quality changes. First, replacing the current domain-based quality scoring approach with an all or nothing standard is a significant change that will have a big impact on ACO performance. Secondly, drastically reducing the number of quality measures from 23 to six de-emphasizes quality and will create a performance standard that may not be truly representative of an ACO's actual quality improvement efforts. Thirdly, abruptly removing the Web Interface as a reporting mechanism will have a big impact on ACOs' ability to get credit for their true quality efforts. CMS should continue to offer the Web Interface as an option and over time allow additional reporting options to those ACOs who would be ready to implement, such as registry or Electronic Health Record (EHR) reporting. Additionally, moving to the alternative reporting options CMS has provided through the proposed APM Performance Pathway (APP) would cause many ACOs to have to pay for registries and/or EHR upgrades and dashboards to capture the correct data to be able to report to CMS. Finally, there are remaining questions regarding how the ACO would report the data for non-Medicare and non-ACO patient data, which is required when reporting using a registry or EHR. This could cause ACOs to have to revisit contracts and could raise legal concerns as the ACO does not typically have access to non-ACO patient data. Finally, we also have deep concerns with the uncertainty of how the impact of COVID-19 will be measured and calculated for the ACO 2020 performance year. The CMS proposed consideration is to exclude all member-months and expenses incurred by attributed beneficiaries with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. While this accounts for COVID expenditures, there are additional factors that have impacted our ACOs. We ask that the proposal also consider the added challenges in retaining ACO attribution due to the drop in primary care visit volume and consider the challenges of recruiting additional ACO participants for the 2021 performance year as community providers are focused on managing through the healthcare crisis.

While the AHA supports the concept of streamlining and\nfocusing quality measure sets, we are not confident that the measure set CMS\nhas proposed for the MSSP is best suited to advancing the program\u2019s goals.

We acknowledge that versions of\nthese six measures already are used in the MSSP program. However, as we note\nbelow, CMS has proposed a significant change to how the data would be reported by\neliminating the web interface reporting option, which would significantly affect how ACO\nperformance is benchmarked in the coming years. As a result, MSSP participants do\nnot know how they would fare using this specific configuration of measures, which is\nespecially alarming given that CMS also proposes to eliminate any pay-for-reporting\nyears (also discussed below).\n\nAdditionally, the proposed changes to the measure set come on the heels of significant\nchanges to the structure of the MSSP program as CMS implemented its New Pathways\napproach. The implementation of drastic changes to measurement as ACOs continue to\nadapt to the new program structure is enormously disruptive to ACOs, especially as\nthey, too, grapple with the significant impacts of the COVID-19 PHE. Instead of\nfinalizing the changes now, we encourage CMS to work with stakeholders to review the\nentirety of the current ACO measure set, and use their input to help identify which\nmeasures are the best candidates for elimination.

However,\nCMS proposes to require ACOs to achieve the 40th percentile of performance as\ncompared to all MIPS quality category scores, as opposed to only ACO scores. As\nnoted in the previous sections of this letter, there are numerous unresolved questions\nabout whether it is appropriate to include non-Medicare patients in ACO quality\nperformance assessment, and whether the inclusion of multiple data collection types\nwould maintain equitable performance comparisons across all ACOs.

The AHA opposes CMS\u2019s proposal to eliminate\npay-for-reporting for first year of MSSP participation, as well as pay-for-reporting \nfor newly added or significantly revised measures.

Pay-for-reporting periods give ACOs the opportunity to ramp up their\nmeasurement and improvement capabilities in a sustainable fashion before their shared\nsavings or losses are tied to quality performance.", "52": "Transition to the APP and Removal of Web Interface Reporting Option\nGNYHA opposes the transition of MSSP quality reporting to the APP. While this proposal would reduce\nthe burden on ACOs in terms of the overall number of measures required for submission, it would impose\nnew burdens because CMS would discontinue the Web Interface reporting option. Instead, ACOs would be\nrequired to report quality information through one of the allowable methods under the APM APP, either\nthrough a registry or direct submission via electronic health records (EHRs).\nACOs have invested significantly in developing processes to allow for the submission of quality data.\nSwitching to either of the APP reporting options would require significant investments in workflow\nchanges, new infrastructure such as registries, and/or adaptation of EHRs to comply with electronic clinical\nquality measure standards.

It would be irresponsible to implement such a drastic change\nat this time.\nFurthermore, the quality submission options proposed by CMS do not allow for quality reporting and\nmeasurement specific to only ACO attributed beneficiaries. Therefore, ACOs would be assessed for quality\nperformance on non-ACO assigned beneficiaries. GNYHA believes that ACO quality performance should\nbe limited, to the extent possible, to the defined cohort of beneficiaries that are assigned to the ACO.\nTherefore, to avoid placing unnecessary burden on providers and to ensure that quality measurement\nreflects the true performance of each ACO, GNYHA recommends that CMS withdraw its proposal\nto remove the Web Interface reporting option.", "53": "Revision of the Quality Performance Standard\nCMS proposes to raise the quality performance standard (the minimum threshold for an ACO to be eligible\nfor shared savings) from the 30th percentile for at least one measure in each domain to requiring a MIPS \nquality performance score at or above the 40th percentile across all MIPS categories.

While we applaud CMS for its efforts to address the potential impact\non the various pay-for-performance programs for 2020, we believe such a major change to the MSSP quality\nperformance standard is premature. The long-term impact of COVID-19 on Medicare beneficiaries and\nultimately its impact on quality measurement is still unclear. For example, CMS\u2019s proposed rule impact\nanalysis is based on 2018 data and therefore may not be representative of average quality performance post\nCOVID-19.

While the agency\u2019s proposal would\nreduce the amount of reporting required of an ACO, it also would require ACOs to quickly pivot from\nestablished quality measurement and reporting processes, even as many of them are still in the midst\nof responding to the pandemic. Specifically, Cleveland Clinic ACO meets its reporting obligations\nvia the Web Interface (as did over 98 percent of ACOs in 2019, as the agency itself noted), and this\nmethod of reporting is sufficiently integrated into our workflows as to be nearly automated. In contrast,\nelimination of the Web Interface would require us to quickly transition to reporting via a different\nmechanism. Further, we would need time to understand the differences in measures specifications\nbetween the Web Interface and our chosen reporting mechanism, and identify and adjust to any\npotential impact on performance.

Finally, there are remaining questions regarding how the ACO would report the data for non-Medicare and non-ACO patient data, which is required when reporting using a registry or EHR. This could cause ACOs to have to revisit contracts and could raise legal concerns as the ACO does not typically have access to non-ACO patient data. Finally, we also have deep concerns with CMS's proposal to remove the pay-for-reporting year currently provided to first time ACOs as well as quality measures that are newly introduced or undergo significant changes. ACOs use the pay-for-reporting year as a time to get the correct processes and performance dashboards in place to be able to be successful in their quality improvement efforts. These are critical and removing them while still holding ACOs accountable for new quality measures, as an example, is unfair and will cause ACOs to hesitate to enter the program. ACOs are committed to providing high quality care to our patients and quality improvement is at the core of what we do. Making these sweeping changes at this challenging time will disadvantage my ACO and we urge CMS to not finalize these proposed ACO quality policies.

Comment on Shared Savings Program Quality Performance Standard\nCMS proposes to increase the level of quality performance that would be required for all ACOs\nto meet the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) quality performance standard to the\n40th percentile or above across all MIPS Quality performance category scores. The previous\nstandard was achieving the 30th percentile on one measure in each domain.\nAdditionally, the proposal includes a provision applicable to 2021 and subsequent performance\nyears specifying that ACOs must submit quality data via the APP to satisfactorily report on\nbehalf of the eligible clinicians who bill under the TIN of an ACO participant for purposes of the\nMIPS Quality performance category.\nCMS proposes that to qualify for shared savings, an ACO must meet the minimum savings rate\nrequirements established for the track/level, meet the proposed quality performance standard\ndescribed in the proposed rule, and otherwise maintain its eligibility to participate in the SPP.\nFor performance years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, if an ACO that is otherwise\neligible to share in savings meets the proposed quality performance standard, the ACO will\nshare in savings at the maximum sharing rate according to the applicable financial model (up to\nthe performance payment limit). If the ACO fails to meet the proposed quality performance\nstandard, the ACO would be ineligible to share in savings.\nRecommendation:\nWe do not support changing the quality measure minimum threshold from the 30th to 40th\npercentile. Achieving shared savings is very difficult work. The 30th percentile is currently\ndifficult to achieve for some measures due to small numbers and tight benchmarks. An ACO could have a high quality score and score below the 40th percentile on just one measure, and\nthe way CMS has written the proposed change, having one measure below the 40th percentile\ncould make the ACO ineligible for shared savings.\nFor the 2019 performances year, our ACO had an overall quality score of 96%; we also scored a\n40th percentile or lower on 2 of the 23 measures. If this proposed change was in place for the\n2019 performance year, our ACO would have been ineligible for shared savings, even with a\nsignificantly high score. The current corrective action plan is the appropriate next step when an\nACO does not score well in quality. We do not support a penalty of losing all shared savings\nopportunities for a year where quality performance does not meet the minimum attainment, as\nNGACOs already take on a high amount of risk.", "61": "I. Comment on Quality and Reporting Requirements\nCMS proposes to revise the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) quality performance\nstandard effective for performance year 2021 and subsequent performance years. According to\nCMS, the new APP would streamline reporting requirements for MSSP ACOs and would create a\ncomplementary path to the MIPS Value Pathways. Under this proposal, the number of\nmeasures ACOs would be scored on would decrease from 23 to 6, and the number of measures\non which ACOs would be required to actively report would be reduced from 10 to 3. ACOs\nwould only need to report one set of quality metrics that would satisfy the reporting\nrequirements under both MIPS and the MSSP. The four categories in the proposed APP \nOur mission is to improve health and well-being in partnership with our members, patients and community.\nframework would be weighted as follows: Quality: 50%; Promoting Interoperability: 30%;\nImprovement Activities: 20%; and Cost: 0%.\nRecommendation:\nOur organization includes providers who participates in the MIPS program and the Next\nGeneration ACO model. The Next Generation ACO model follows the same rules as the MSSP\nACOs. As a Next Generation ACO, we appreciate that Medicare is proposing to reduce the\nnumber of quality measures for ACOs. This would reduce the reporting burden and allow ACOs\nto focus on a select number of quality measures. A lower number of measures also means that\nthere is more weight placed on only a few quality measures.\nWe have reviewed the proposed quality measures and agree with continuing to report on the\nproposed Preventive Health and At Risk Population measures. However, we would request\nmore information on the CAHPS measures such as will the current 2019/2020 CAHPS measures\ncontinue in 2021? HealthPartnersthrough its Park Nicollet ACO has participated in CMMI ACO\nrisk programs since 2012 and because of the subjective nature of the survey our overall patient\nexperience domain score has varied significantly through the years. We believe part of this\ncould be that the survey is lengthy, and not all of the questions apply to all of the patients,\ncausing a low response rate to some of the questions that can skew the results. Only 861 of our\noverall ACO patients (~15,000) receive this survey and less than 400 of our patients usually\ncomplete the survey. The number of patients responding creates a challenge. It is difficult to\nimplement changes to address all survey topics for all patients as well as rely on the patient to\nrecall what was recently discussed. We are also concerned about the number of surveys that\nour patients receive as it is our organizations current practice to send all patients a short\nexperience survey after each visit at HealthPartners.\n\nHealthPartners agrees that Patient Experience is an important part of the triple aim to evaluate\nand would like to continue including these measures in quality reporting, however we are\nconcerned that reducing the number of overall measures puts disproportionate weight on the\nCAHPS for ACO survey results for all the reasons noted above; we are not fully confident that\nthe results of the survey reflect our ACO patients experience.\n\nThe proposed 2021 quality measures also include 2 claims measures from the Care\nCoordination/Patient Safety domain. Our ACO would also like to provide feedback on these 2\nmeasures as 2 of the 6 proposed measures. We have found that we have also had a lot of\nvariation for our results related to the Risk Standardized 30-Day Readmissions measure.\nHealthPartners has found that the benchmarks for the claims based measures are very tight.\nOur numerator and denominator are relatively small, which means that if a few additional\npatients are admitted or readmitted (depending on the measure) our results can easily swing\nfrom passing to failing. We would suggest evaluating how the benchmarks are set for the\nclaims-based measures.....", "63": "IV. Proposal to Modify the CAHPS for MIPS Quality Reporting\nCMS notes that the MSSP extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy applies for the CY\n2020 performance period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result CMS proposes to waive\nthe requirement to field the CAHPS survey and will grant all ACOs full credit for the CAHPS\nmeasures.\nRecommendation:\nWe ask that for performance year 2020, the requirement for ACOs to administer/report CAHPS has been\nwaived, and will receive full credit for CAHPS reporting. Recommend to apply the same waiver to MIPS\ngroups that elected to administer/report CAHPS, to create alignment amongst the programs.\nAlso, it\u2019s noted the ACOs 2021 CAHPS measures will count as one score. Recommend that all domains\nbe scored as have historically, since there may only be 5 additional measures reported for ACOs.\nMeasuring all domains will then will continue the alignment between the ACO and MIPS programs.", "64": "VII. Sunset of the Web Interface\nCMS proposes to eliminate the web interface reporting option starting with the CY 2021\nreporting period. This option was previously available to groups and virtual groups of 25\nclinicians or more. CMS indicates that the use of the web interface has declined significantly\nover the past two performance periods. Furthermore, CMS proposes to eliminate the\nrequirement for MSSP participants to report quality measure data via the web interface, and\nthe vast majority of web interface users were in the MSSP. We describe the MSSP quality\nreporting changes elsewhere in this advisory. Lastly, CMS notes that the web interface\nrequirements were significantly more stringent than the other MIPS reporting options, and that\nnine out of the 10 measures included in the web interface would remain available in the MIPS\nusing one of the other MIPS reporting options.\nRecommendation:\nRetiring the Web Interface at this time would create an undue hardship and financial burden on\npractices, as currently still operating in COVID-19 pandemic state. It also reduces flexibility in reporting\nas to what works well for one practice versus another. The consensus among industry analysts is that\nmost electronic health records have not been able to keep up with the changing requirements of the\nMIPS program, and that QCDRs are not able to report all categories of the program. It would be\ndetrimental that CMS provides a list of all MVP measures/specifications to all electronic medical record\nvendors and QCDRs early on, so that all EMRs and QCDRs have the ability to report in a timely manner.\nThe administrative burden associated with moving to a new reporting mechanism involves allocating\nstaffing resources to redesign care process and work flows, at the potential expense of the overall care\nexperience for patients in order to meet the reporting requirements. Also, it states on page 50279 of\nthe rule, that the traditional MIPS option will continue to be available for 2021. Therefore, we\nrecommend that the Web Interface remain a reporting option in 2021 to allow practices time to convert\nto a new reporting mechanism, with the ability to test out the new reporting mechanism alongside the\nweb interface. This would allow groups to continue submissions as have historically and would ease\nreporting burden during a national pandemic.\nSome of the reporting options offered, such as eCQMs and MIPS CQMs, require all payer data be\nsubmitted. This is a significant change from reporting Medicare FFS only through the Web Interface, as\nthe denominator has been greatly increased, and creates unknown risk in how a practice may score\nunder the new reporting method. Therefore, we again recommend that groups be allowed to report\ntwo ways for 2021 \u2013 through the Web Interface and another option chosen. This is not much different\nthan what CMS allows today, reporting the category components through different reporting options\nand keeping the highest score across sources.", "67": "Quality Performance to determine MSSP Shared Savings and Shared Losses\nProposal: CMS proposes that if an ACO that is otherwise eligible to share in savings meets the\nproposed quality performance standard, that ACO will share in savings at the maximum sharing\nrate according to the applicable financial model, up to the performance payment limit.\nComment: BILHPN supports the proposal to share savings at the maximum sharing rate if an\nACO meets the proposed quality performance standard. Eliminating the current savings rate\ncalculation will be beneficial to ACOs given the higher quality performance standard that is\nbeing proposed. However, BILHPN is concerned with the quality performance standard as it is\ncurrently proposed. BILHPN recommends that CMS decrease the 40th percentile threshold to a\n30th percentile threshold to allow ACOs to become acquainted with MIPS reporting. CMS could\nrevisit increasing the performance threshold to the 40th percentile in future years.", "69": "APM Performance Pathway for Shared Savings Program ACOs\nProposal: CMS proposes to revise the MSSP quality performance standard by replacing the\ncurrent quality measure set with the APM Performance Pathway (APP). Additionally, CMS\nproposed that ACOs would only need to report one set of quality metrics (via the APP) that\nwould satisfy the reporting requirements under both MSSP and MIPS.\nComment: BILHPN supports reducing the quality measure set from 23 to six and eliminating the\nCMS Web Interface as a collection type. Furthermore, BILHPN agrees with CMS that using a\nsingle methodology to measure quality performance under both the MSSP and Merit-based\nIncentive Payment System (MIPS) would reduce reporting burden and allow ACOs to track a\nsmaller set of measures under one scoring methodology.", "85": "Medicare Shared Savings Program\n\uf0b7 CMS should not apply the quality performance standard to shared savings the\nway it is proposed. ACOs should not be ineligible to share in savings if they do\nnot meet the more stringent quality performance standard.\nCurrently, an ACO needs to achieve the 30th percentile on at least one measure in each domain to meet the minimum quality standard and be eligible for shared savings. We believe this requirement is achievable since the benchmarks are released early enough during the performance year, helping an ACO set goals throughout the year. In addition, there are enough measures in each domain to allow ACOs to meet the 30th percentile in at least one measure per domain. We believe that the proposal to increase the minimum threshold from the 30th to the 40th percentile sets too high of a bar, especially if the 2021 benchmarks are not being released until after the 2021 performance year and the number of measures is reduce to six for 2021. We ask CMS to revisit the 40th percentile proposal and keep this at the 30th percentile for 2021. In addition, we ask CMS to consider allowing some or all measures to be pay-for-reporting for the 2021 performance year due to the current public health emergency. We would also ask that CMS continue to award improvement points for ACOs who are able to increase their performance from one year to the next in order to recognize the work the ACO has undertaken to improve their quality score.\nAPP: AMGA supports the use of the APP as a scoring pathway for Merit-based Incentive\nPayment System (MIPS) alternative payment models (APMs), as long as CMS maintains\nits other reporting mechanisms in the process.", "86": "We support this proposal to allow ACOs to be awarded the higher of 2019 or 2020 quality performance as well as waiving reporting requirements for CAHPS for ACOs by providing automatic full credit for the patient/caregiver experience domain due to the impact of PHE for COVID-19. We agree that the option to award the higher of 2019 or 2020 performance would reserve the option for ACOs who fully report on the 2020 quality performance measures, whereas ACOS who do not fully report quality for 2020 performance would be awarded the 2020 ACO mean quality score. New York City was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and there was reduced or delayed non-COVID care for several months during the 2020 performance year. We expect our quality performance in 2020 may be impacted by the limited elective clinical services available during the public health emergency and appreciate the CMS proposal to make adjustments to how 2020 performance will be scored.", "88": "CMS offers several policy changes in recognition of the impact of COVID-19 on providers and suppliers. CMS indicates that it will consider all ACOs to be affected by Page 10 of 12 the COVID-19 PHE for PY 2020 and that the MSSP extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy applies. For performance year 2020, CMS proposes to provide Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) with full credit for Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Provider and Systems (CAHPS) patient experience of care surveys. CMS also requests comment on using the higher of an ACO\u2019s 2019 or 2020 quality performance score for ACOs that report complete data for 2020 and the mean ACO quality score for ACOs that do not report complete data. Given the impact of the COVID-19 PHE on the entire health care system, including care access and patient experience, flexibilities are warranted and will be important to the longer-term stability of the MSSP program and its success. Due to the continued impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, we also recommend that CMS consider stakeholder input and propose further changes for PY 2021 that may be warranted to reduce unnecessary burdens on providers to better enable them to focus on providing care to Medicare enrollees and responding to continuing challenges. AHIP supports CMS\u2019 proposed flexibility for MSSP PY 2020 given the extenuating circumstances and further urge it to consider additional flexibility for PY 2021 with stakeholder input.", "91": "CMS proposes that MSSP ACOs would report quality measure data via a new Alternative Payment Model (APM) Performance Pathway (APP), instead of the CMS Web Interface. Page 11 of 12 The proposed rule would replace the current MIPS APM Scoring Standard, which allows each APM to have its own set of unique quality measures and scoring approaches that best fit the particular model. The current approach allows specific APMs to have meaningful quality measures tailored to their model\u2019s goals while still providing credit for quality improvement efforts to those who are also subject to MIPS. The proposed APP approach would instead apply one set of quality measures for all APMs subject to MIPS. Therefore, each model participant would need to report not only their APM\u2019s specific quality measures, but the APP quality measures as well. This one size fits all approach results in more burden for APM participants and further may require the model participants to report on measures that are not applicable or appropriate. Moreover, given the proposed delay in the implementation of MVP, we are unclear why this proposal should be rushed to implementation. The MSSP ACOs have used the Web Interface since the beginning of the program and will need time to create a new workflow. We instead urge CMS to maintain the APM Scoring Standard. CMS also proposes significant changes to the quality measure set ACOs must report under the new APP. The total number of ACO quality measures would be reduced from 23 to 6, and the number of measures for which ACOs are required to submit data would be reduced from 10 to 3. Generally speaking we support a reduction in measures to reduce reporting burden. However, we are concerned the proposal goes too far and may not sufficiently capture ACO performance. We urge CMS to gather additional stakeholder input before finalizing a revised set. In particular, from the Measure Applications Partnership (MAP) that is intended to advise on the appropriateness of measures in Medicare, and the Core Quality Measure Collaborative (CQMC) on which CMS partners with AHIP that is intended to facilitate the alignment of measures across public and private payers. CMS should seek additional stakeholder feedback before making such significant changes to the measure set and within the context of whether its finalizes the APM Scoring Standard policy.", "92": "CMS proposes that ACOs would need to achieve at least a 40th percentile quality performance score across all categories to share in savings or avoid owing maximum losses. CMS proposes that it could terminate participation agreements with ACOs that fail to meet the quality performance standard for two consecutive years or three non-consecutive years, out of a five-year contract. We are concerned about increasing the minimum quality performance score to the 40th percentile and CMS establishing a policy to terminate participation agreements with ACOs that fail to meet the quality performance standard at this time. While we appreciate and support ensuring the ACOs meet a minimum level of quality and increasing that minimum over time, the current pandemic calls for a pause in any increases in expectations. As CMS notes, 99.6 percent of ACOs participating in the Page 12 of 12 program in 2018 met the 30th percentile showing that a small minority of ACOs struggle in this area and would benefit from technical assistance rather than being dropped from the program. These ACOs have committed to pursuing higher quality outcomes and have every incentive to do so. If they are dropped from the program, the providers and suppliers that comprise them will have less motivation to invest time and resources to achieve such outcomes. Moreover, as measures become topped out or change unexpectedly due to the pandemic, failure to meet a threshold may reflect more about the scoring system itself or exigent forces than the actual quality of patient care. Thus, we do not, at this time, support increasing the minimum quality threshold or removing ACOs from the MSSP program for failing to achieve it.", "93": "For CY2021, CMS proposes to reduce provider burden, align measures across programs, and address high priority areas for quality improvement by implementing APM Performance Pathway (APP) for MIPS APMs for MSSP Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) for the 2021 performance year. Under the new approach, ACOs would report one set of quality measures that would satisfy MSSP and MIPS requirements. Additionally, CMS is proposing to simplify the reporting requirements by reducing the number of reported measures from 23 measures to six, and the number of actively reportable measures from ten to three. The proposed implementation date for the APP is January 1, 2021. Centene supports efforts to streamline quality measurement and reporting. However, we caution against any massive program changes that may create more complications for ACOs. As CMS continues to propose adjustments to the MSSP program, we ask that there is a smooth transition period for any major methodology changes. In order to effectively encourage performance improvements and ACO participation, CMS should actively work to reduce operational burden.", "96": "While we appreciate CMS' goal of aligning measures across programs and support eliminating unnecessary and inappropriate measures, Ochsner is exceedingly concerned about and cannot endorse the extent to which CMS has proposed to reduce the MSSP quality measure set. Further, these sweeping changes would be implemented during a COVID-19 Public Health Emergency and are tied to a final rule that will be released in December 2020, which will leave ACOs only one month to transition to the new reporting method.\nFrom a broad perspective, Ochsner believes that ACOs should not be evaluated and assessed in the same manner as all other APMs or individual MIPS clinicians who are not participating in total cost of care and full accountability payment models. It is also unclear how CMS determined that the APP measures are more appropriate the current APM quality measures. The proposed one size fits all approach does not take into consideration the spectrum and variability between MIPS APM programs where each APM has specific goals and objectives or create a set of measures that better inform patients. For example, it does not make clinical sense for the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced, or BPCI-A, to be compared and measured on the same set of measures that apply to the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) participants. Quality measurement with APM programs should focus on measures most appropriate for the individual program and hold health care providers and organizations accountable for the quality and cost of care.\nOchsner recommends that CMS postpone making any structural changes to how ACO quality is assessed and reported until at least 2022 or 2023 and work with stakeholders to develop the best balanced, fair and technically sound quality measures. In the meantime, we urge CMS to maintain the current APM Scoring Standard approach. While the proposed revision to ACO quality measures may reduce administrative burden, they significantly alter and narrow the lens through which quality is assessed. The proposed six APP measures are a drastic reduction from the 23 measures currently used to assess ACOs. We believe the proposal goes too far by reducing the number of clinical quality measures to only three measures focused on controlling diabetes and high blood pressure and screening for depression. We recommend that CMS retain several important preventative care quality measures that are a strength of the current set of quality measures and have been proven to improve patient outcomes, including: ACO-14, Influenza Immunization; ACO-19,\nColorectal Cancer Screening; ACO 20, Breast Cancer Screening; and, the previously used Pneumonia Vaccination measure.\nWe also have significant concerns that two of the six quality measures are focused on All-Cause Unplanned Hospital Admissions and Readmissions. The unplanned readmissions measure has a very narrow band where there is less that a 1 percent difference between the 30th percentile and the 90th percentile for the 2020 benchmark targets for ACO-8, Risk Standardized, All Condition Readmission. As a result, small differences in readmissions can result in drastic differences in quality scores that are not meaningful or an accurate reflection of an ACO's quality improvement efforts. Further, since the ACO program already provides direct financial incentives to reduce avoidable hospital admissions and readmissions, we do not believe it is appropriate to have onethird of the total measure set linked to these utilization measures. In response, Ochsner recommends that CMS postpone any significant changes in ACO quality measures until 2022 or 2023 and utilize the interim period to consult with the ACO community and patient representatives to determine the most appropriate set of measures that will lead to meaningful improvements in the quality of care.", "97": "Ochsner opposes this all-or nothing approach to shared savings, particularly surrounding the use of the proposed hospital readmissions measure with an extremely narrow bands in performance percentiles. Instead, should CMS move forward with its redesigned quality assessment structure for ACOs, we recommend that CMS use a scoring method similar to the current domain-based scoring approach. For example, CMS could instead consider a policy that would use a minimum attainment requiring 50 percent of the quality measures to meet or exceed the 40th percentile, which must also be done in concert with our recommendations to add additional clinical quality measures to the measure set currently proposed by CMS. Setting the standard at 50 percent ensures that ACOs perform well on a substantial set of measures to earn shared savings but does not punish ACOs that may fall below the performance threshold on a measure that is not as relevant to their patient population or has a very narrow range of performance percentiles, such as the proposed hospital readmissions measure.", "104": "Quality Performance Standard and Shared Savings Determination\nCMS proposes to increase the quality performance standard by raising the current minimum attainment\nlevel from the 30th percentile to the 40th percentile. ACOs that meet the quality performance standard\nwould share in savings at the maximum sharing rate. The current approach is to multiply the quality score\nby the maximum sharing rate. We support raising the quality performance threshold and allowing\nACOs that meet the standard to receive full shared savings, provided that this change accompanies a\nsmaller program measure set and the standard is assessed as an average of the measures.\nWe would not support a 40th percentile standard applied to each measure given our concerns about\nseveral of the measures", "105": "Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Changes\nFor performance year 2021, CMS proposes to change the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances\napproach to align with the proposed quality changes. CMS would set the minimum quality performance\nscore for an ACO affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance during the performance year to\nequal the 40th percentile MIPS Quality performance category score. We support this change.", "109": "MHA has member organizations that include providers who participates in the MIPS program and the Next Generation ACO model. The Next Generation ACO model follows the same rules as the MSSP ACOs. As a Next Generation ACO, we appreciate that Medicare is proposing to reduce the number of quality measures for ACOs. This would reduce the reporting burden and allow ACOs to focus on a select number of quality measures. A lower number of measures also means that there is more weight placed on only a few quality measures.\nWe have reviewed the proposed quality measures and agree with the continuing to report on the proposed Preventive Health and At Risk Population measures. However, we would request more information on the CAHPS measures such as will the current 2019/2020 CAHPS measures continue in 2021? One MHA member has participated in CMMI ACO risk programs since 2012 and because of the subjective nature of the survey our overall patient experience domain score has varied significantly through the years.\nPatient experience is an important part of the triple aim to evaluate and should be included in these measures, however there is concern that reducing the number of overall measures puts disproportionate weight on the CAHPS for ACO survey results.\nThe proposed 2021 quality measures also include 2 claims measures from the Care Coordination/Patient Safety domain. An MHA member ACO would also like to provide feedback on these 2 measures as 2 of the 6 proposed measures. This member has found that there is a lot of variation for their results related to the Risk Standardized 30-Day Readmissions measure. Benchmarks for the claims based measures are very tight. Numerators and denominators are relatively small, which means that if a few additional patients are admitted or readmitted (depending on the measure), results can easily swing from passing to failing. We would suggest evaluating how the benchmarks are set for the claims-based measures. We would also like the readmissions benchmark to be evaluated considering the CMS Hospital Readmission Penalty Program has determined to remove at least Q1 and Q2 2020 readmissions from their performance data. Additionally, we would like more information on if adjustments will be made for the ACO Readmission data, both exclusions and benchmarking impact.\nThe measure Risk Standardized All- Cause Admissions for Patients with Chronic Conditions is also very challenging to address and track during the year. The same MHA member ACO as above reports that it has tried to create a proxy measure to track how we are performing on this measure, however they have not been able to do that for the following reasons. There are a total of 8 conditions in this measure and the patient has to have at least 2 of the 8 to be in the numerator. They have not been able to duplicate the same risk-adjustment methodology to compare their results to how they would be measured. Their ACO has multiple interventions in place to address the needs of patients with chronic conditions, however their results for this measure do not always reflect this. We would suggest evaluating how the benchmarks are set for the claims-based measures. We would also suggest considering adding additional measures that reflect our work with preventive health.", "110": "MHA and its members do not support changing the quality measure minimum threshold from the 30th to 40th percentile.

Given the numerous changes to the MSSP extreme and\nPage 18\nuncontrollable circumstances policy made over the last two years -- including those made during the\nPHE to account for impacts arising out of COVID-19 -- we encourage CMS to avoid any additional\nsignificant policy changes as we collectively continue to assess the impacts of COVID-19 and have more\nexperience and data to share that might better inform additional changes to the established policy.", "133": "CMS proposes to establish two policies that would allow certain ACOs to benefit from a lower repayment mechanism amount than would otherwise be required under the current regulations. The first policy would apply prospectively to any renewing ACO that uses an existing repayment mechanism to establish its ability to repay any shared losses incurred for performance years in its new agreement Page 19 period. The second policy would permit certain ACOs whose agreement periods began July 1, 2019 or January 1, 2020 to elect to reduce the amount of their repayment mechanisms. We appreciate CMS\u2019s ongoing efforts to minimize burdens associated with the repayment mechanism. We support both of CMS\u2019s repayment proposals and encourage the agency to finalize them as proposed. At the same time, we also encourage the agency to take additional steps to further reduce the burdens associated with repayment mechanism requirements. Many ACOs cite the burden and cost of securing a repayment mechanism as primary barriers against moving to a risk-based ACO model. To eliminate third party transactional fees that detract from investments in patient care, we urge CMS to remove the repayment mechanism requirement when an ACO can demonstrate that it has an investor or financial backer with a high credit rating. Financial backers could include outside investors, insurers, or hospitals or health systems that are aligned with the ACO and committed to providing financial support should losses occur. This flexibility would protect ACOs\u2019 finances, as well as the federal fisc, and eliminate the need for a 24-month tail period, which is an additional burden on ACOs. At the very least, if CMS continues to require a repayment mechanism, we encourage the agency to minimize associated regulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for a tail period, which is increasingly important in light of longer agreement periods.", "134": "AAHPM appreciates CMS\u2019 interest in developing a reporting mechanism for MIPS APM participants that would reduce reporting burden and encourage continued APM participation under its proposed APM Performance Pathway (APP), as well as in streamlining reporting requirements for participants under the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP). However, we believe CMS missed an important opportunity to encourage appropriate care for patients by failing to propose measure #47, Advance Care Plan, in the APP quality measure set. As noted above, advance care planning services are essential to ensuring high-quality care for Medicare beneficiaries, particularly those with serious illness or at the end of life. These discussions enable care teams to understand patients\u2019 values and goals in order to guide decisions about care and treatment. Studies show that advance care planning also leads to higher patient and family satisfaction with quality of care, less hospitalization, less intensity of treatment near end of life, more hospice use, and a higher likelihood of patients dying in their preferred place, as well as less stress, anxiety, and depression in surviving caregivers. For these reasons, we believe that CMS should hold MSSP and MIPS APM participants accountable for performance on the Advance Care Plan measure under the APP. We note that this would align with actions CMS has taken for other models, where it has recognized the importance of advance care planning services in several models currently underway. For example, the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced model assesses participant performance on this measure across all clinical episodes. Likewise, the Medicare Advantage Value-Based Insurance Design (MA VBID) model also requires all participating Medicare Advantage organizations to develop and implement a strategy regarding the delivery of timely AAHPM CMS-1734-P October 5, 2020 11 Wellness and Health Care Planning (WHP) services, including advance care planning services, to all enrollees. Otherwise, we note that it is difficult for AAHPM to assess CMS\u2019 APP proposal given the lack of information on participation in MIPS APMs and Advanced APMs by specialty. AAHPM strongly encourages CMS to increase transparency regarding the extent of specialty participation in each MIPS APM and Advanced APM by including data on specialty-level participation in such models in the annual QPP Experience Report or through annual rulemaking.", "137": "Changes to quality thresholds We support CMS\u2019 aim to drive improvements in the quality of care furnished by ACOs, and we generally support raising quality performance thresholds over time. We support the proposal for ACOs who completely report and are at or above the 40th percentile to receive the full maximum savings rate. We believe this supports CMS\u2019 stated goal of encouraging APM participation, and will act as a quality improvement incentive. If the proposal to raise the minimum attainment level from the 30th percentile to the 40th percentile is finalized, we recommend applying this as an average of all measures rather than to each measure individually. This is important both because of the concerns with the APP quality measures described above, and because the all-or-nothing approach proposed will create circumstances in which ACOs fail to share in savings through natural statistical variation rather than true poor performance. For example, an ACO in the 39th percentile on one quality measure but in the 95th percentile on all others may be locked out of shared savings completely. We are concerned about this all-or-nothing approach and are certain that such an abrupt cutoff will deter APM participation. Accordingly, we recommend that if an ACO completely reports and does not meet the Minimum Performance Level, the maximum shared savings rate should be multiplied by the quality score as it is today. In this way the ACO will receive shared savings proportionate to their quality performance, and ACOs that do not meet the threshold for a measure with narrow distribution or due to natural statistical variation will not be unduly punished.", "139": "Proposal to change PY 2020 quality reporting to account for PHE We thank CMS for flexibilities granted during the PHE, and appreciate CMS\u2019 recognition that the extraordinary events of 2020 will have a long and lasting impact on the industry and measures we use.

It is important that CMS require specialty reporting from these large groups to ensure accountability for the quality of specialty care at large multi-specialty practices. We strongly support requiring large multi-specialty groups to report on specialty measures, and we further ask CMS to encourage participation among these large groups in specialty-led QCDRs. Specialty-led QCDRs provide a valuable and unique source of specialty-specific quality data that is not collected elsewhere and is critical to understanding the entire value equation. Without incentives for large, multi-specialty practices to report on specialty-specific quality metrics, CMS is limiting the performance data available to patients regarding the quality of care that specialty doctors provide.

We recognize that often when first engaging in quality reporting the effort is more about data collection than it is about the quality of care provided. Clinicians, systems, and ACOs require adequate time and resources to implement workflows so that data can be appropriately collected and accurately capture the care provided \u2013 and for providers to review and understand the data to help inform quality improvement efforts going forward. The pay-for-reporting year and for individual measure changes importantly provides this ramp up opportunity for ACOs to be successful with quality reporting. This appropriate and necessary transitional year helps to ensure there are no unintended consequences or flaws in the measure\u2019s specifications before holding an ACO accountable for performance in the measure. Indeed, removing pay-for-reporting only places additional burden on those providing care by requiring new reporting without resources to support it.

In place of the Web Interface, the APP would require ACOs to actively report on\nthree clinical quality measures, which could be reported using a registry or direct via\nelectronic health records (EHRs) using electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM)\nstandards. These eCQMs must be reported for all patients, regardless of payer.\n\nComments: CMS proposes to abruptly end the use of the Web Interface reporting\nmechanism, a tool that has been used since the MSSP\u2019s inception. Removing this option for\nthe NHN ACO with little notice is ill-timed and unfair.\nCMS has not been clear regarding how the alternative MIPS reporting options will be\nutilized for ACOs (as APM Entities) specifically. There are several key questions and\nobstacles to moving away from this reporting method in this timeframe. For example, the\ncurrent remaining MIPS reporting options available under the APP would be registry (MIPS\nCQMs) and EHR (eCQMs). Using these reporting options would result in the NHN being\nevaluated on quality for all patients the NHN\u2019s providers serve, not only ACO assigned\npatients. This is not a true evaluation of the ACO\u2019s quality efforts and, additionally, raises\ncontractual and legal concerns, as an ACO may not have the ability to access patient data\nfor non-ACO patients. NHN providers have invested significant resources for development\nof reporting processes and workflows to optimize this process; removing web interface\nreporting option altogether would undermine these investments, thus diverting critical\nresources away from improving patient care.\nAdditionally, CMS has not stated if aggregation of data and performance calculations will\nhappen at the CMS level. Current Web Interface reporting allows for aggregation of\nperformance across the ACO and supports one data file submission. Reporting via the\neCQM method may not be possible if ACO participants have differing electronic medical\nrecords (EMRs). Current state eCQM reporting creates an aggregate report per TIN. ACOs\ncan have many different participating TINs, all of which could have different EMRs. If\naggregation of data and performance doesn\u2019t happen at the CMS level, ACOs would need\nto employ a third party data aggregation vendor in order to submit one data file at the APM\nentity level. This could add additional cost to ACOs.\nCMS should consider a transition away from the Web Interface reporting option, once\nconsideration is given to performance aggregation at the APM entity level and the option to\nreport eCQMs for only the attributed beneficiaries and not all patients and payers. This\nwould align with current structure of reporting only attributed beneficiaries while moving\nACOs away from Web Interface reporting. For example, CMS should work with industry\nleaders to create QRDAIII aggregate TIN level reporting for assigned beneficiaries. Then,\neach TIN would submit the QRDA III file via the QPP website and CMS would calculate\nperformance scores for the APM entity. Currently, practice level reporting is utilized for\nCPC+ and the upcoming Primary Care First model.\nFor these reasons, Nebraska Medicine urges CMS to provide a more gradual transition\naway from the use of the Web Interface reporting option to give more time and thought to\nhow this will practically be implemented and to give our ACO and our providers more time to\nassess alternatives.", "224": "In addition, there are a number of changes that are being proposed in how quality will be evaluated starting in 2021. In the current proposal, performance scoring needs to be at or above the 40th percentile in order to meet the quality performance standard. CMS has noted that many ACOs perform well in quality under the current standards and thereby, increasing the standards to which an ACO needs to achieve in order to be eligible to earn shared savings. In addition, currently the CAHPS for ACO questions are counted as 10 individual measures in the Patient/Caregiver experience domain and in the proposed rule the CAHPS for MIPS survey related questions will be counted just as one measure. CMS is also proposing to wait until the 2021 reporting is complete to release the 2021 benchmarks. Currently, an ACO needs to achieve the 30th percentile on at least one measure in each domain to meet the minimum quality standard and be eligible for shared savings. We believe this requirement is achievable since the benchmarks are released early enough during the performance year, helping an ACO set goals throughout the year. In addition, there are enough measures in each domain to allow ACOs to meet the 30th percentile in at least one measure per domain. We believe the proposal to increase the minimum threshold from the 30th to the 40th percentile sets too high of a bar, especially if the 2021 benchmarks are not being released until after the 2021 performance year and the number of measures is reduce to six for 2021. We ask CMS to revisit the 40th percentile proposal and keep this at the 30th percentile for 2021. In addition, we ask CMS to consider allowing some or all measures to be pay-forreporting for the 2021 performance year due to the current public health emergency. We would also ask that CMS continue to award improvement points for ACOs who are able to increase their performance from one year to the next in order to recognize the work the ACO has undertaken to improve their quality score.", "230": "Summary of key recommendations: MSSP Proposals \n\u2022 Do not finalize proposals to change the way ACOs are measured on and report quality measures.

CMS does not include any further details regarding how CMS would determine if the three required measures were not applicable to the ACO. Comments: CCHI opposes this approach to provide ACOs the option of selecting alternative quality measures to report. First, we cannot contemplate instances when the proposed APP measures listed would be determined to not apply to an ACO. Second, allowing this option would make program evaluation nearly impossible. Evaluating ACO\u2019s impact on quality should be a key focus for CMS and, therefore, there should be one standard set of quality measures that apply to all ACOs participating in the model.

Assignment is a critical program methodology that determines the beneficiary population for which an ACO is held accountable. Adding codes such as \u201ce-visits,\u201d chronic care management, and principal care management will help create a better picture of where patients receive most of their primary care. CMS should continue to refine the primary care codes used in assignment, and we request that the agency do so in a timely manner. We recommend CMS finalize adding the nine proposed codes to the MSSP assignment methodology. CCHI also appreciates CMS\u2019s desire to ensure that patients are attributed to providers from whom they receive their primary care services. Therefore, we support excluding advance care planning services from MSSP assignment when billed in an inpatient setting and also excluding professional services furnished by FQHCs or RHCs when delivered in a SNF. Both of these changes, while technical in nature, help create more complete and accurate patient assignment lists for ACOs and we recommend the agency finalize these proposals. While CCHI appreciates CMS\u2019s work to refine assignment during the COVID-19 PHE, CCHI recommends that CMS use a two-year assignment window for MSSP to account for potential variations in attribution in 2020 and 2021. Especially in states hit harder by the pandemic, healthy patients may forego routine primary care and throw off assignment for MSSP ACOs who use either retrospective or prospective attribution. Therefore, patient visits from 2019 and 2020 should be considered for ACOs\u2019 assignment lists regardless if ACOs choose prospective attribution or retrospective attribution. While the windows for either groups of ACOs will be different, the same general principle applies and would help create more steady and accurate assignment lists.

Moving to a registry or EHR-based reporting method will significantly increase the number of patients an ACO must report on and be evaluated on under CMS proposals. Currently, ACOs must report on 248 ACO patients included in the Web Interface. Under the registry option, an ACO would have to report on 60 percent of their patients, both Medicare and non-Medicare patients as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For the EHR reporting method, ACOs would be required to report on 70 percent of patients, both Medicare and non-Medicare as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For some ACOs this could be a drastic increase and will therefore add significant administrative burden for the ACO. Should CMS finalize this approach, the agency should be requiring the ACO to report on, at a maximum, 50 percent of exclusively ACO patients.

While we are supportive of the proposal to ease reporting burden for MSSP participants, we ask CMS to reconsider the elimination of the APM Scoring Standard.\nIn general, we support the proposed measures, as they represent a shift away from process measures toward more meaningful outcome measures. However, fewer measures provide less room for error \u2013 random variation in one measure will have a larger impact when there are fewer measures to absorb the impact.

ACOs have built significant infrastructure and workflows using the Web Interface reporting mechanism, in place since the beginning of the MSSP program. To suddenly sunset this mechanism of reporting and require a completely new method in just a few months seems unreasonable. For ACOs, requiring quality measure reporting for all patients regardless of payer is an extremely challenging if not impossible requirement. Our ACO (and many others) are comprised of physician practices with separate TINs, on separate EHR and billing systems. It would be impossible to identify all patients eligible for the measures given these disparate systems. An ACO would not have the same access to, or insights regarding a \"total patient population\" without claims and shared EHR technology. We would recommend that CMS might consider keeping the quality reporting for ACOs limited to Medicare FFS attributed patients for 2021.", "375": "We would strongly recommend that CMS continue to cover video TCM visits (99495 and 99496) as Category 1 services when the PHE is over. We would like this coverage to include all patients and not just those in rural designations or in the higher track ACO programs. It is also recommended that there be no copay for the beneficiaries for these visits. \n\nWe would ask that these two types of visits (G0438 and G0439) continue to be covered by CMS via televideo after the PHE without copays for the beneficiaries. We also ask for coverage for all patients and not just those under rural designation or the MSSP programs.", "379": "Secondly, drastically reducing the number of quality measures from 23 to 6 de-emphasizes quality and will create a performance standard that may not be truly representative of an ACO's actual quality improvement efforts.", "380": "hirdly, abruptly removing the Web Interface as a reporting mechanism will have a big impact on ACOs' ability to get credit for their true quality efforts. CMS should continue to offer the Web Interface as an option and over time allow additional reporting options to those ACOs who would be ready to implement, such as registry or Electronic Health Record (EHR) reporting.", "393": "COVID-19 MIPS Exceptions\n\u2022 ASCRS and OOSS appreciate CMS providing burden relief via previously announced extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy exceptions for 2019 and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are several issues with the CAHPS measures as\ncurrently collected. As an example, the CAHPS measures use a very small sampling of\npatients and rely on patient recollection of experience that took place months prior. CMS\nshould consider altering surveys to accept results from shorter surveys provided closer to\nreal time and to a much larger population.", "411": "Securing a repayment mechanism is a regulatory burden, which is time\nconsuming and costly for ACOs. We appreciate CMS\u2019s efforts to minimize burdens\nassociated with the repayment mechanism. Currently, a renewing ACO that wants to use its\nexisting repayment mechanism in the subsequent agreement period is required to maintain\na higher repayment mechanism amount than necessary for its new agreement period if the\nrepayment mechanism amount for the last performance year of the previous agreement\nperiod is greater than what is needed for the subsequent agreement period. We support\nCMS\u2019s proposal to eliminate this requirement and recommend it be finalized.", "414": "Proposals: CMS proposes to allow individual clinicians and group TINs the option of\nchoosing to report outside the ACO for purposes of MIPS analysis. Should a practice or\nclinician choose this option, it would be required to select the appropriate measures and\nreporting method and report separately from the ACO for purposes of MIPS scoring. In this\ncase, these clinicians/groups would only be provided with 50 percent automatic credit for\nimprovement activities (while ACOs are awarded with full points automatically for this\nperformance category). CMS would then award clinicians with the higher of their own\nscores or the ACO\u2019s score for MIPS.\n\nComments: LGHCCC has concerns that this policy would allow certain organizations to\nselect measures for which they have the highest historical performance, not allowing for a\ntrue and fair assessment of quality improvement efforts. Additionally, this could cause more\ncomplexity and confusion to an already very complicated process. We instead urge CMS to\nmaintain the APM Scoring Standard approach, under which ACOs would be evaluated on\nMSSP quality measures for MIPS.", "435": "Additionally, moving to the alternative reporting options CMS has provided through the proposed APM Performance Pathway (APP) would cause many ACOs to have to pay for registries and/or EHR upgrades and dashboards to capture the correct data to be able to report to CMS.\n\n Finally, there are remaining questions regarding how the ACO would report the data for non-Medicare and non-ACO patient data, which is required when reporting using a registry or EHR. This could cause ACOs to have to revisit contracts and could raise legal concerns as the ACO does not typically have access to non-ACO patient data.", "437": "CHPA also advocates for expansion of telehealth services to include ACO waivers for the FQHCs and RHCs. Providing these services to the most vulnerable is critical to maintaining and improving the health of our population.", "460": "Additionally, CHPA opposes the overall approach proposed for ACO quality scoring. With upcoming changes to MIPS through the MIPS Value Pathways and exemptions due to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as for COVID-19, the 40th percentile of the Quality Category score could vary greatly from year to year making it a less meaningful indicator of true performance. Instead, should CMS move forward with proposals to re-design the quality assessment structure for ACOs, we urge CMS to utilize a 7 scoring approach that is more similar to the current domain-based scoring approach instead of using an all-or-nothing approach as proposed. As an example, CMS could instead consider a policy that would use a minimum attainment standard that requires 50 percent of the quality measures to meet or exceed the 40th percentile. This must be done in conjunction with our recommendations to add additional clinical quality measures to the measure set beyond the three that CMS has currently proposed. Setting the standard at 50 percent ensures that ACOs perform well on a substantial set of measures to earn savings but does not punish ACOs that miss the mark on a measure that is either not as relevant to their patient population or has a very narrow range of performance rates. Finally, CHPA also urges CMS to better reward high quality performers, as is done in the Medicare Advantage program by providing bonuses or higher shared savings rates to high quality performers or those that notably improve quality scores over time.", "466": "Under the Pathways to Success regulations when a recalculated repayment mechanism increases by a certain amount (i.e., the lesser of 50 percent or $1,000,000), CMS requires the ACO to increase the value of the repayment mechanism. However, CMS does not currently decrease the repayment mechanism amount when the opposite occurs, a policy for which CHPA has advocated and which the agency proposes to change in this rule. We appreciate CMS\u2019s proposal to allow ACOs an option to decrease their repayment mechanism amount if the recalculated amount is less than the current amount, and we request the agency finalize this policy. We also support CMS providing an opportunity for ACOs that renewed their agreements effective in 2019 or 2020 an opportunity to benefit from this policy change, if finalized, by adjusting their repayment mechanism amounts already in place, if they quality under the revised policy.", "524": "ASCO supports the agency\u2019s proposals for flexibilities for ACOs including the application of the \u201cExtreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances\u201d policy. For performance year 2020, all ACOs are considered affected by the Public Health Emergency (PHE) for the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Shared Savings Program extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy applies. In addition, for performance year 2020 only, CMS is proposing to waive the requirement for ACOs to field a Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) for ACOs survey. Consequently, ACOs would receive automatic full credit for the patient experience of care measures."}
