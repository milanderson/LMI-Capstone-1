{"2": "Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comments on the proposed rule regarding the Medicare Shared Savings Program quality reporting for 2021.\n\nWhile I applaud the efforts to optimize quality reporting and move in the direction of low-burden, high-value measurement, the 2021 elimination of the Web Interface reporting mechanism will cause undue burden for Medicare Shared Savings Program ACO participants. It is not unusual for ACOs to be comprised of participants on disparate electronic health records. The Web Interface tool allows for seamless pairing clinical data from various sites. Elimination of this reporting mechanism in the short-term will create a reporting challenge for ACOs, and providers that comprise them, at an already dynamic time for healthcare organizations. If the goal remains to eliminate the Web- Interface mechanism, a prolonged phase-out will allow organizations to prepare.", "3": "...In addition, the move to a 4th decile ACO quality performance threshold could prove detrimental for organizations struggling in the readmission and unplanned admission for multiple chronic condition metrics. These vital measures of utilization practices are complex and require intensive shifts in practice patterns to gain measurable improvement. Given the aforementioned strains on the current healthcare system, the timing is poor to institute more stringent provider performance thresholds for ACOs.", "4": "We respectfully decline from supporting CMS proposals to make sweeping changes to how\nQuality is assessed for the Shared Savings Program and for the Merit Based Incentive program\n(MIPS). ACO\u2019s are currently experiencing extreme stress due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and\nwe are very concerned about our ability to cope with so many drastic changes. We urge CMS to\npostpone making changes to the structure of the MSSP quality measurement program.\n\nACOs\u2019 have invested considerable resources into maintain high quality which is the cornerstone\nof Value Based Care. The purpose and aim of quality measurement must be to improve patient\ncare and not to fit a universal mold. ACOs\u2019 should never be assessed the same as other APMs\nand MIPs programs. CMS should further refine quality measures to enhance patient care. CMS\ncreated APMs with specific goals in mind and we strongly feel that quality measures must be\nindividually tailored for the needs of each APM.\n\nThe proposed approach lumps all APMs and MIPS providers into one basket. Historically ACOs\nhave paralleled Medicare Advantage Plans and ACO quality standards are very similar to the\nMedicare Advantage program. We are also opposed to ACO participants from selecting to report\noutside the ACO since allowing the same could distort the performance of the risk bearing ACO.\nWe urge CMS to continue the APM scoring standard at least until a proper ACO centric\nReplacement Methodology can be agreed upon by all concerned stakeholders", "5": "PBACO is in favor of reducing administrative burden however we have significant concerns that\nthe proposals, including limiting the number of performance based measures, puts ACOs at risk\ndue to the dependence on the stability of fewer measures. Over our seven years of program\nparticipation we have observed the MSSP make errors and subsequent corrections to ACO-11 in\nPY2016 and PY2017. Furthermore, we have noticed remarkable nuances in the adjustment \n3\nmethodology in our ACO CAHPS measures. We support broad measurement across many\nmeasures where ACOs are insulated by the affects of errors, adjustments or other anomalies that\ncan potentially erase an ACO quality performance score and ultimately their shared savings\nmultiplier and opportunity for annual revenue. We support that a larger set of quality measures\nsmooths such anomalies, reduces overall ACO risk and is worth any additional administrative\nburden.", "6": "CAHPS Survey: We do not support combining the survey into one measure due our experience\nthat certain measures can have anomalies including MSSP errors, unpredictable adjustments and\nor other unexpected outcomes.\n\nSimply put, any benefit from reduced administration is far offset by the increased risk of the\ndependence on the accuracy and statistical stability of a single measure set.\nAdditionally, ACO CAHPS cannot be compared to MIPS CAHPS. PBACO will have\napproximately 90,000 Patients during 2021 and require a sample system that truly reflect large\nACOs. The present system of 860 patients is too small a percentage of patients to predict the\nPatient satisfaction scores with a 95% confidence level. We propose increasing the PBACO\nsample size to 2,000 patients as opposed to the MIPS-CAHPS requirement of 60,000 patients\nwhich is impractical to administer and very expensive.", "7": "Present GPRO Measures: We strongly disagree with canceling the CMS Web Interface. It has\nbeen our experience that eCQM adoption at practices is less than 25%. PBACO has over 30\nEMR systems with various capabilities as well as a dedicated team of three ACO employees to\nfacility education, optimization and implementation of our provider EHR systems. Some EMRs\nare not ready to collect eCQMs intuitively and providers must go through convoluted workflows\nto report eCQMs. Secondly providers will have to report data from other payers, in addition to\nMedicare as many EHRs do not have the capability to report by payer. This distorts the ACO\u2019s\nMedicare specific quality performance reporting. It is our opinion that the various EHR\ncertification should refine and standardize workflows for eCQMs which have been tested in the\nfield and which do not increase administrative burden for providers. It is our observation that the\nrespective EHRs have various workflows for the same eCQMs and have not been pervasively\nimplemented. The gap to achieve effective and efficient implementation of eCQMs is still large\nand too large to justify the replacement of CMS Web Interface quality submissions.\n\nWe do not agree that the proposed three quality measures are adequate to measure provider\nperformance and to provide adequate insolation from the statistical risks of dependency on such\nfew measures. We do agree that the Domain score of 50% should not change with the proposed\nrule however we strongly recommend reinstating more and essential ACO measures. Please refer\nto TABLE 36P. We have added back a) Colorectal Cancer Screening, b) Breast Cancer\nScreening, Depression Screening and Follow-Up, Influenza immunization, and Pneumococcal\nvaccinations. These measures are the core measures in an ACOs quality performance. PBACO\nhas observed favorable outcomes from the training and implementation of Depression screening\nand Follow-Up. We would like to reintroduce Pneumococcal vaccinations as an important\nmeasure to reduce hospitalizations due to various forms of Pneumonia. Additionally, during\nCOVID-19 patients will have higher immunity levels to Pneumonia caused Bronchial infections.\nAlong with the reintroduction of these measures we request that the Domain score for measures\nrelated to the WI remain stay constant at 50%.", "8": "Claims Based Measures: We disagree with the proposed increased weight of the claims-based\nmeasures to 33% of the total score from 25%. We propose the reinstatement of Ambulatory\nSensitive Condition and maintain the total domain weight for Claims Based Measures at 25%.\nEssentially, we are proposing no change to these measures. We further caution CMS that the\nreduction of claims based measures and the increase in domain weight can have unintended\nconsequences and the introduction of risks to ACOs. Please consider the MSSP errors and\nsubsequent corrections to ACO-11 in PY2016 and PY2017. We believe that these errors set a\nprecedent that errors can happen and that broadly reduces an ACOs ability to smooth or defend\nitself from such errors. Considering that any given measure will have significantly more\nindividual significance, errors, like those that occurred in PY2016 or PY2017 have a much\nhigher chance of completely erasing an ACO quality performance score and ultimately their\nshared savings multiplier and their opportunity for annual revenue.", "9": "Removing the CMS Web Interface Reporting Mechanism \nIt took several years of education and technological investment for PBACO to effectively and\nefficiently report quality using the CMS Web Interface. Eliminating this option will drastically\nincrease PBACOs cost for quality reporting due to the various EMR vendors\u2019 eCQM annual\nregistry fees.\n\nWe also have significant concerns regarding the lack of uniformity and ability to be compared to\npeers with the way eCQMs are collected today. Today\u2019s EMRs report eCQMs for all\nbeneficiaries including ACO and non-ACO beneficiaries and Medicare and non-Medicare\nbeneficiaries. We believe that this is a significant programmatic downside where current\nperformance is Medicare, incentive and demographic specific. In additional to the introduction of\npotentially irrelevant performance measurement, the variety and inconsistency of demographics\nby provider may potentially distort the performance measurement and the ability to accurately\ncompare providers. It is possible that our payer specific Data Use Agreements do not cover all\ndemographics and we may run into legal conflicts with Insurance companies. PBACO is in favor\nof less administrative burden but requests that CMS continues to pursue other options including\nmore widespread adoption of the CMS Web Interface. It is our proposal that CMS continues to\nrun eCQMs in parallel with the CMS Web Interface and monitors the results.\nCurrently, PBACO is reporting quality for 2,792 patients. Under the proposed rule we will be\nforced to report quality on 60,000 ACO patients across dozens of disparate systems at a\nsignificant financial expense.\n\nACO Quality must be Targeted to ACOs and their ACO peers and cannot be compared to\nproviders with disparate value based contract implementation, payor mix or demographic mix.", "10": "PBACO opposes the removal of Pay-for-Reporting when new measures are introduced. ACOs\nneed time to educate on, build and implement workflows for new quality measures. We urge\nCMS to not finalize this approach and instead maintain the pay-for-reporting for the first year\nintroduced to ACOs in their initial performance year, as well as new quality measures when they\nare introduced or significantly changed.\nPBACO urges CMS to utilize a scoring approach that is more like the current domain-based\nscoring approach instead of using an all-or-nothing approach as proposed. We do not see the\ncorrelation of value delivered by ACO providers and the way that they are scored with an all-ornothing approach. We find it difficult to state that a 20th percentile performer receives 0 points\nor delivers 0 value while a 30th percentile performer receives 1.2 points or 55% of the value. We\nbelieve that further promoting this all-or-nothing approach will unjustly disconnect the\ncorrelation from the value that Medicare beneficiaries and the Medicare Trust Fund receive from\nstatus performance of ACOs and discourage providers from participation. One side effect of\nincreased ACO participation is improved performance in ACO quality measures and the increase\nof the performance thresholds for percentile scoring. The all-or-nothing proposal of the 40th\npercentile required threshold allows that \u201cgood\u201d performance of previous years may be classified\nas 0 performance in future years. We expect that this is an enormous risk to the sustainability\nand the perceived fairness of the program by providers.

Additionally, due to the negative impact of COVID-19 on\nsample size and performance scores, CMS proposes to remove the requirement for ACOs to field\na CAHPS for ACOs survey for PY 2020.

We\nthink there is value to Medicare Shared Savings program for ACOs with upside only risk. There are privately\npracticing physicians who are committed to actively engage in the Shared Savings Program work to innovate\nand improve healthcare processes, but either cannot afford to personally take on risk, or because the margins\nare small in the ACO financials, even a small amount of risk to too much for them to bear. We have physicians\nraising grave concerns about being required to take on risk. As you are aware, physician lead ACOs historically\noutperform hospital lead ACOs. Upside only ACOs generate Shared Savings. We are aware Medicare wants to\npush all ACO to high risk, because the current high risk ACOs tends to generate greater degree of Savings. At\nthis point, high risk ACOs are self-selected. If all ACOs were forced into high risk, Medicare cannot ensure the\nsame degree of savings will occur. A steady amount of shavings generated by upside only ACOs brings value\nto the Medicare system, continues to drive improvements and is potentially more sustainable long term. Does\nMedicare want short term gains or long term gains? Personally, we think it is better to have steady long term\nbenefits for the program.", "18": "Change from domain based approach to an all or nothing approach - We disagree with these\nchanges and request Medicare continue with the domain based approach. These changes are\nsubstantial. Why does Medicare want to make it more difficult for ACOs to attain shared\nsavings? From my personal perspective, this is counter intuitive. Shared Savings is the carrot\nto make change happen. The threshold for receiving a percentage of savings should be\nreasonably obtainable. Physician lead ACOs utilize a significant amount of the shared savings\nto drive innovation, care coordination and to support the practices to drive improvement.\nMaking the threshold too high will make the program no longer financially feasible for the\nphysicians to participate.\nIf physician lead ACOs consolidates with large entities to manage the ACOs, then Medicare will\nsuffer from the natural outcome of large consolidation, which is standardization.\nStandardization reduces the amount of innovation that occurs and we will have another\nversion of the Medicare Advantage system.\nA different thought on encouraging change is to have a step process for quality measures and\npercentage of savings which can be done for upside only ACOs. Example: ACOs can choose to\ngo with the current 23 measures for up to 50% of the shares savings of which they will receive\nsavings based on their overall quality score. The alternative is to move to the proposed 6\nmeasures report through the web interface and have the opportunity for 70% of shared\nsavings, because moving to a limited measure set of outcome based measures has greater risk\nand challenges.", "19": "Quality Performance Standard: We request to keep the minimum quality achievement at 30%\nper measure not 40%. Some measures are very challenging and the ACO has limited control of\nall of the various healthcare delivery components to the measure, such as all cause\nreadmissions and unplanned admissions. For example, it has taken us several years to have\nthe local hospitals provide the ACO access to the discharge lists for our patients. Since it can\ntake time to build and educate on why working with the ACO is of value, we request Medicare\nto maintain the current minimum of 30%. \n\nA second example to take into consideration, our ACO suffered a substantial decline in\nmammography rates, because a regional mobile mammography provider went out of business.\nThis was a major provider of mammography services for our ACO patients and is no longer\navailable for our region. They were the only provider. Now we have substantial issues with\ntransportation to obtain mammography screening. Issues like this are unpredictable and if\nflexibility is removed from the system, the ACO could suffer significantly.\nA third example is when ACOs take on new physician practices. Even when new practices have\nexperience in working with quality measures and risk, the ACO environment is different than\nthe Medicare Advantage experience and does not translate to success. The ACO environment\nhas a different process and cadence that must be taught. If an ACO takes on too many new\npractices, this can create a significant challenge in improving quality measures year over year.\nACOs need time to adapt and find new solutions for unpredictable events and taking on new\nphysician practices.

How will CMS accommodate for these patients for whom the physician is doing\ntheir best to assist the patient, yet the patient is unable or unwilling to archive measure goals?\nIn addition, is CMS taking into account the ACO patient mix with the 6 identified quality\nmeasures? Do the ACOs have the same relative volume of diabetes and hypertension? If not,\nhow will this be addressed?

The changes come at a very challenging time as our ACO and the health care industry as a whole continue to navigate the great uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 global health pandemic. We urge CMS not to implement changes to the quality program until a future performance year and continue to work with ACOs to adapt the quality measurement and assessment process. These changes are significant and touch every aspect of quality improvement efforts from reporting quality data, tracking measure performance, and how ACOs are evaluated and scored for both the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) and Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). There are multiple concerns with the proposed ACO quality changes. First, replacing the current domain-based quality scoring approach with an all or nothing standard is a significant change that will have a big impact on ACO performance. Secondly, drastically reducing the number of quality measures from 23 to six de-emphasizes quality and will create a performance standard that may not be truly representative of an ACO's actual quality improvement efforts. Thirdly, abruptly removing the Web Interface as a reporting mechanism will have a big impact on ACOs' ability to get credit for their true quality efforts. CMS should continue to offer the Web Interface as an option and over time allow additional reporting options to those ACOs who would be ready to implement, such as registry or Electronic Health Record (EHR) reporting. Additionally, moving to the alternative reporting options CMS has provided through the proposed APM Performance Pathway (APP) would cause many ACOs to have to pay for registries and/or EHR upgrades and dashboards to capture the correct data to be able to report to CMS. Finally, there are remaining questions regarding how the ACO would report the data for non-Medicare and non-ACO patient data, which is required when reporting using a registry or EHR. This could cause ACOs to have to revisit contracts and could raise legal concerns as the ACO does not typically have access to non-ACO patient data. Finally, we also have deep concerns with the uncertainty of how the impact of COVID-19 will be measured and calculated for the ACO 2020 performance year. The CMS proposed consideration is to exclude all member-months and expenses incurred by attributed beneficiaries with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. While this accounts for COVID expenditures, there are additional factors that have impacted our ACOs. We ask that the proposal also consider the added challenges in retaining ACO attribution due to the drop in primary care visit volume and consider the challenges of recruiting additional ACO participants for the 2021 performance year as community providers are focused on managing through the healthcare crisis.

The implementation of drastic changes to measurement as ACOs continue to\nadapt to the new program structure is enormously disruptive to ACOs, especially as\nthey, too, grapple with the significant impacts of the COVID-19 PHE. Instead of\nfinalizing the changes now, we encourage CMS to work with stakeholders to review the\nentirety of the current ACO measure set, and use their input to help identify which\nmeasures are the best candidates for elimination. The agency could consider using\ninput from the Measure Applications Partnership (MAP) as a part of its upcoming cycle\nto obtain multi-stakeholder input on these changes.

The AHA does not support the removal of the\nweb interface reporting option for ACOs at this time. The web interface has been\nused by ACOs since the MSSP\u2019s inception to report data on non-claims based\nmeasures used in the program. The web interface collects data on Medicare\nbeneficiaries participating in the MSSP, and has a set of data collection and attribution\napproaches associated with it. However, CMS proposes to eliminate it because its use\noutside of the MSSP program is limited, and the agency is seeking to bring the MSSP\nquality measurement approach into closer alignment with the MIPS.\nWhile we appreciate the potential benefits of greater alignment between programs,\nthere are profound differences between how data are submitted in the \u201cregular\u201d MIPS\nprogram and how they are reported by ACOs using the web interface. In the first place,\nthe data collection types that would now be available to ACOs \u2013 EHRs, qualified\nregistries and qualified clinical data registries \u2013 all require data to be collected on an allpayer basis, and not simply on Medicare beneficiaries. For a program that is called the\nMedicare Shared Savings Program, and is intended to improve the care for Medicare\nbeneficiaries, we question the appropriateness of including all-payer data.\nFurthermore, allowing the use of multiple different reporting options in the MSSP could\nhave significant impacts on measure benchmarks. There are differences in the measure\nspecifications among each of these reporting mechanisms; it is possible, even when\nreporting on the same measure title, to receive different scores. For that reason, when\nCMS calculates performance benchmarks in the MIPS program, it creates separate\nbenchmarks for each data collection type. Yet, CMS does not address in this rule how it\nintends to reconcile any potential performance differences among ACOs that may stem\nfrom differences in data collection types.\nUnless and until CMS can address the two issues above, it is not appropriate to remove\nthe web interface reporting option. At a minimum, we urge the agency to delay removal\nof the reporting mechanism until CY 2022 at the very earliest.", "49": "Increase to Quality Performance Standard.

However,\nCMS proposes to require ACOs to achieve the 40th percentile of performance as\ncompared to all MIPS quality category scores, as opposed to only ACO scores. As\nnoted in the previous sections of this letter, there are numerous unresolved questions\nabout whether it is appropriate to include non-Medicare patients in ACO quality\nperformance assessment, and whether the inclusion of multiple data collection types\nwould maintain equitable performance comparisons across all ACOs.

The AHA opposes CMS\u2019s proposal to eliminate\npay-for-reporting for first year of MSSP participation, as well as pay-for-reporting \nfor newly added or significantly revised measures.

While this proposal would reduce\nthe burden on ACOs in terms of the overall number of measures required for submission, it would impose\nnew burdens because CMS would discontinue the Web Interface reporting option. Instead, ACOs would be\nrequired to report quality information through one of the allowable methods under the APM APP, either\nthrough a registry or direct submission via electronic health records (EHRs).\nACOs have invested significantly in developing processes to allow for the submission of quality data.\nSwitching to either of the APP reporting options would require significant investments in workflow\nchanges, new infrastructure such as registries, and/or adaptation of EHRs to comply with electronic clinical\nquality measure standards. Not only would this impose significant financial and operational burdens on\nACOs, the required operational changes could not be completed by the start of the 2021 performance year.\nAs with all health care providers, ACOs are currently struggling with numerous challenges and significant\nuncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It would be irresponsible to implement such a drastic change\nat this time.\nFurthermore, the quality submission options proposed by CMS do not allow for quality reporting and\nmeasurement specific to only ACO attributed beneficiaries. Therefore, ACOs would be assessed for quality\nperformance on non-ACO assigned beneficiaries. GNYHA believes that ACO quality performance should\nbe limited, to the extent possible, to the defined cohort of beneficiaries that are assigned to the ACO.\nTherefore, to avoid placing unnecessary burden on providers and to ensure that quality measurement\nreflects the true performance of each ACO, GNYHA recommends that CMS withdraw its proposal\nto remove the Web Interface reporting option.", "53": "Revision of the Quality Performance Standard\nCMS proposes to raise the quality performance standard (the minimum threshold for an ACO to be eligible\nfor shared savings) from the 30th percentile for at least one measure in each domain to requiring a MIPS \nquality performance score at or above the 40th percentile across all MIPS categories. This change makes it\nmore difficult for ACOs to earn shared savings. As mentioned above, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused\nsignificant uncertainty among ACOs. While we applaud CMS for its efforts to address the potential impact\non the various pay-for-performance programs for 2020, we believe such a major change to the MSSP quality\nperformance standard is premature. The long-term impact of COVID-19 on Medicare beneficiaries and\nultimately its impact on quality measurement is still unclear. For example, CMS\u2019s proposed rule impact\nanalysis is based on 2018 data and therefore may not be representative of average quality performance post\nCOVID-19.

These changes are significant and touch every aspect of quality improvement efforts from reporting quality data, tracking measure performance, and how ACOs are evaluated and scored for both the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) and Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). The changes come at a very challenging time, when our ACO and the health care industry as a whole continue to navigate the great uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 global health pandemic. We urge CMS to not finalize these proposals and continue to work with ACOs to adapt the quality measurement and assessment process. There are multiple concerns with the proposed ACO quality changes. First, replacing the current domain-based quality scoring approach with an all or nothing standard is a significant change that will have a big impact on ACO performance. Secondly, drastically reducing the number of quality measures from 23 to six de-emphasizes quality and will create a performance standard that may not be truly representative of an ACO's actual quality improvement efforts. Thirdly, abruptly removing the Web Interface as a reporting mechanism will have a big impact on ACOs' ability to get credit for their true quality efforts. CMS should continue to offer the Web Interface as an option and over time allow additional reporting options to those ACOs who would be ready to implement, such as registry or Electronic Health Record (EHR) reporting. Additionally, moving to the alternative reporting options CMS has provided through the proposed APM Performance Pathway (APP) would cause many ACOs to have to pay for registries and/or EHR upgrades and dashboards to capture the correct data to be able to report to CMS. Finally, there are remaining questions regarding how the ACO would report the data for non-Medicare and non-ACO patient data, which is required when reporting using a registry or EHR. This could cause ACOs to have to revisit contracts and could raise legal concerns as the ACO does not typically have access to non-ACO patient data. Finally, we also have deep concerns with CMS's proposal to remove the pay-for-reporting year currently provided to first time ACOs as well as quality measures that are newly introduced or undergo significant changes. ACOs use the pay-for-reporting year as a time to get the correct processes and performance dashboards in place to be able to be successful in their quality improvement efforts. These are critical and removing them while still holding ACOs accountable for new quality measures, as an example, is unfair and will cause ACOs to hesitate to enter the program. ACOs are committed to providing high quality care to our patients and quality improvement is at the core of what we do. Making these sweeping changes at this challenging time will disadvantage my ACO and we urge CMS to not finalize these proposed ACO quality policies.

Comment on Shared Savings Program Quality Performance Standard\nCMS proposes to increase the level of quality performance that would be required for all ACOs\nto meet the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) quality performance standard to the\n40th percentile or above across all MIPS Quality performance category scores. The previous\nstandard was achieving the 30th percentile on one measure in each domain.\nAdditionally, the proposal includes a provision applicable to 2021 and subsequent performance\nyears specifying that ACOs must submit quality data via the APP to satisfactorily report on\nbehalf of the eligible clinicians who bill under the TIN of an ACO participant for purposes of the\nMIPS Quality performance category.\nCMS proposes that to qualify for shared savings, an ACO must meet the minimum savings rate\nrequirements established for the track/level, meet the proposed quality performance standard\ndescribed in the proposed rule, and otherwise maintain its eligibility to participate in the SPP.\nFor performance years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, if an ACO that is otherwise\neligible to share in savings meets the proposed quality performance standard, the ACO will\nshare in savings at the maximum sharing rate according to the applicable financial model (up to\nthe performance payment limit). If the ACO fails to meet the proposed quality performance\nstandard, the ACO would be ineligible to share in savings.\nRecommendation:\nWe do not support changing the quality measure minimum threshold from the 30th to 40th\npercentile. Achieving shared savings is very difficult work. The 30th percentile is currently\ndifficult to achieve for some measures due to small numbers and tight benchmarks. An ACO could have a high quality score and score below the 40th percentile on just one measure, and\nthe way CMS has written the proposed change, having one measure below the 40th percentile\ncould make the ACO ineligible for shared savings.\nFor the 2019 performances year, our ACO had an overall quality score of 96%; we also scored a\n40th percentile or lower on 2 of the 23 measures. If this proposed change was in place for the\n2019 performance year, our ACO would have been ineligible for shared savings, even with a\nsignificantly high score. The current corrective action plan is the appropriate next step when an\nACO does not score well in quality.

Comment on Quality and Reporting Requirements\nCMS proposes to revise the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) quality performance\nstandard effective for performance year 2021 and subsequent performance years. According to\nCMS, the new APP would streamline reporting requirements for MSSP ACOs and would create a\ncomplementary path to the MIPS Value Pathways. Under this proposal, the number of\nmeasures ACOs would be scored on would decrease from 23 to 6, and the number of measures\non which ACOs would be required to actively report would be reduced from 10 to 3. ACOs\nwould only need to report one set of quality metrics that would satisfy the reporting\nrequirements under both MIPS and the MSSP. The four categories in the proposed APP \nOur mission is to improve health and well-being in partnership with our members, patients and community.\nframework would be weighted as follows: Quality: 50%; Promoting Interoperability: 30%;\nImprovement Activities: 20%; and Cost: 0%.\nRecommendation:\nOur organization includes providers who participates in the MIPS program and the Next\nGeneration ACO model. The Next Generation ACO model follows the same rules as the MSSP\nACOs. As a Next Generation ACO, we appreciate that Medicare is proposing to reduce the\nnumber of quality measures for ACOs. This would reduce the reporting burden and allow ACOs\nto focus on a select number of quality measures. A lower number of measures also means that\nthere is more weight placed on only a few quality measures.\nWe have reviewed the proposed quality measures and agree with continuing to report on the\nproposed Preventive Health and At Risk Population measures. However, we would request\nmore information on the CAHPS measures such as will the current 2019/2020 CAHPS measures\ncontinue in 2021? HealthPartnersthrough its Park Nicollet ACO has participated in CMMI ACO\nrisk programs since 2012 and because of the subjective nature of the survey our overall patient\nexperience domain score has varied significantly through the years. We believe part of this\ncould be that the survey is lengthy, and not all of the questions apply to all of the patients,\ncausing a low response rate to some of the questions that can skew the results. Only 861 of our\noverall ACO patients (~15,000) receive this survey and less than 400 of our patients usually\ncomplete the survey. The number of patients responding creates a challenge. It is difficult to\nimplement changes to address all survey topics for all patients as well as rely on the patient to\nrecall what was recently discussed. We are also concerned about the number of surveys that\nour patients receive as it is our organizations current practice to send all patients a short\nexperience survey after each visit at HealthPartners.\n\nHealthPartners agrees that Patient Experience is an important part of the triple aim to evaluate\nand would like to continue including these measures in quality reporting, however we are\nconcerned that reducing the number of overall measures puts disproportionate weight on the\nCAHPS for ACO survey results for all the reasons noted above; we are not fully confident that\nthe results of the survey reflect our ACO patients experience.\n\nThe proposed 2021 quality measures also include 2 claims measures from the Care\nCoordination/Patient Safety domain. Our ACO would also like to provide feedback on these 2\nmeasures as 2 of the 6 proposed measures. We have found that we have also had a lot of\nvariation for our results related to the Risk Standardized 30-Day Readmissions measure.\nHealthPartners has found that the benchmarks for the claims based measures are very tight.\nOur numerator and denominator are relatively small, which means that if a few additional\npatients are admitted or readmitted (depending on the measure) our results can easily swing\nfrom passing to failing.

It also reduces flexibility in reporting\nas to what works well for one practice versus another. The consensus among industry analysts is that\nmost electronic health records have not been able to keep up with the changing requirements of the\nMIPS program, and that QCDRs are not able to report all categories of the program. It would be\ndetrimental that CMS provides a list of all MVP measures/specifications to all electronic medical record\nvendors and QCDRs early on, so that all EMRs and QCDRs have the ability to report in a timely manner.\nThe administrative burden associated with moving to a new reporting mechanism involves allocating\nstaffing resources to redesign care process and work flows, at the potential expense of the overall care\nexperience for patients in order to meet the reporting requirements. Also, it states on page 50279 of\nthe rule, that the traditional MIPS option will continue to be available for 2021. Therefore, we\nrecommend that the Web Interface remain a reporting option in 2021 to allow practices time to convert\nto a new reporting mechanism, with the ability to test out the new reporting mechanism alongside the\nweb interface. This would allow groups to continue submissions as have historically and would ease\nreporting burden during a national pandemic.\nSome of the reporting options offered, such as eCQMs and MIPS CQMs, require all payer data be\nsubmitted. This is a significant change from reporting Medicare FFS only through the Web Interface, as\nthe denominator has been greatly increased, and creates unknown risk in how a practice may score\nunder the new reporting method. Therefore, we again recommend that groups be allowed to report\ntwo ways for 2021 \u2013 through the Web Interface and another option chosen.

However, we do not feel the current\nproposed APP measure set achieves this goal. As quality reporting programs focus more on\noutcomes and move away from process measures, CMS must ensure that measures\nchosen for these programs accurately reflect quality of care and account for factors\nbeyond a hospital\u2019s control. The agency should ensure the measure set includes metrics that\nare valid and reliable; aligned with other existing measures; and risk adjusted for\nsociodemographic factors. CMS should not include measures in ACO quality\nperformance standards until they have been appropriately risk adjusted for\nsociodemographic factors, including socioeconomic status. Without appropriate risk\nadjustment for outcomes measures, such as the proposed readmission measure, the\nAPP measure set could disproportionately impact the performance of essential\nhospitals.\nWe urge CMS to take time to gather more stakeholder input, such as through a request for\ninformation and listening sessions. Further, CMS should seek endorsement by organizations\nwith measurement expertise, such as the National Quality Forum (NQF) and its Measure\nApplications Partnership (MAP).

ACOs should not be ineligible to share in savings if they do\nnot meet the more stringent quality performance standard.\nCurrently, an ACO needs to achieve the 30th percentile on at least one measure in each domain to meet the minimum quality standard and be eligible for shared savings. We believe this requirement is achievable since the benchmarks are released early enough during the performance year, helping an ACO set goals throughout the year. In addition, there are enough measures in each domain to allow ACOs to meet the 30th percentile in at least one measure per domain. We believe that the proposal to increase the minimum threshold from the 30th to the 40th percentile sets too high of a bar, especially if the 2021 benchmarks are not being released until after the 2021 performance year and the number of measures is reduce to six for 2021. We ask CMS to revisit the 40th percentile proposal and keep this at the 30th percentile for 2021. In addition, we ask CMS to consider allowing some or all measures to be pay-for-reporting for the 2021 performance year due to the current public health emergency. We would also ask that CMS continue to award improvement points for ACOs who are able to increase their performance from one year to the next in order to recognize the work the ACO has undertaken to improve their quality score.\nAPP: AMGA supports the use of the APP as a scoring pathway for Merit-based Incentive\nPayment System (MIPS) alternative payment models (APMs), as long as CMS maintains\nits other reporting mechanisms in the process.", "91": "CMS proposes that MSSP ACOs would report quality measure data via a new Alternative Payment Model (APM) Performance Pathway (APP), instead of the CMS Web Interface. Page 11 of 12 The proposed rule would replace the current MIPS APM Scoring Standard, which allows each APM to have its own set of unique quality measures and scoring approaches that best fit the particular model. The current approach allows specific APMs to have meaningful quality measures tailored to their model\u2019s goals while still providing credit for quality improvement efforts to those who are also subject to MIPS. The proposed APP approach would instead apply one set of quality measures for all APMs subject to MIPS. Therefore, each model participant would need to report not only their APM\u2019s specific quality measures, but the APP quality measures as well. This one size fits all approach results in more burden for APM participants and further may require the model participants to report on measures that are not applicable or appropriate. Moreover, given the proposed delay in the implementation of MVP, we are unclear why this proposal should be rushed to implementation. The MSSP ACOs have used the Web Interface since the beginning of the program and will need time to create a new workflow. We instead urge CMS to maintain the APM Scoring Standard. CMS also proposes significant changes to the quality measure set ACOs must report under the new APP. The total number of ACO quality measures would be reduced from 23 to 6, and the number of measures for which ACOs are required to submit data would be reduced from 10 to 3. Generally speaking we support a reduction in measures to reduce reporting burden. However, we are concerned the proposal goes too far and may not sufficiently capture ACO performance. We urge CMS to gather additional stakeholder input before finalizing a revised set. In particular, from the Measure Applications Partnership (MAP) that is intended to advise on the appropriateness of measures in Medicare, and the Core Quality Measure Collaborative (CQMC) on which CMS partners with AHIP that is intended to facilitate the alignment of measures across public and private payers. CMS should seek additional stakeholder feedback before making such significant changes to the measure set and within the context of whether its finalizes the APM Scoring Standard policy.", "92": "CMS proposes that ACOs would need to achieve at least a 40th percentile quality performance score across all categories to share in savings or avoid owing maximum losses. CMS proposes that it could terminate participation agreements with ACOs that fail to meet the quality performance standard for two consecutive years or three non-consecutive years, out of a five-year contract. We are concerned about increasing the minimum quality performance score to the 40th percentile and CMS establishing a policy to terminate participation agreements with ACOs that fail to meet the quality performance standard at this time. While we appreciate and support ensuring the ACOs meet a minimum level of quality and increasing that minimum over time, the current pandemic calls for a pause in any increases in expectations. As CMS notes, 99.6 percent of ACOs participating in the Page 12 of 12 program in 2018 met the 30th percentile showing that a small minority of ACOs struggle in this area and would benefit from technical assistance rather than being dropped from the program. These ACOs have committed to pursuing higher quality outcomes and have every incentive to do so. If they are dropped from the program, the providers and suppliers that comprise them will have less motivation to invest time and resources to achieve such outcomes. Moreover, as measures become topped out or change unexpectedly due to the pandemic, failure to meet a threshold may reflect more about the scoring system itself or exigent forces than the actual quality of patient care. Thus, we do not, at this time, support increasing the minimum quality threshold or removing ACOs from the MSSP program for failing to achieve it.", "93": "For CY2021, CMS proposes to reduce provider burden, align measures across programs, and address high priority areas for quality improvement by implementing APM Performance Pathway (APP) for MIPS APMs for MSSP Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) for the 2021 performance year. Under the new approach, ACOs would report one set of quality measures that would satisfy MSSP and MIPS requirements. Additionally, CMS is proposing to simplify the reporting requirements by reducing the number of reported measures from 23 measures to six, and the number of actively reportable measures from ten to three. The proposed implementation date for the APP is January 1, 2021. Centene supports efforts to streamline quality measurement and reporting. However, we caution against any massive program changes that may create more complications for ACOs. As CMS continues to propose adjustments to the MSSP program, we ask that there is a smooth transition period for any major methodology changes. In order to effectively encourage performance improvements and ACO participation, CMS should actively work to reduce operational burden.", "96": "While we appreciate CMS' goal of aligning measures across programs and support eliminating unnecessary and inappropriate measures, Ochsner is exceedingly concerned about and cannot endorse the extent to which CMS has proposed to reduce the MSSP quality measure set. Further, these sweeping changes would be implemented during a COVID-19 Public Health Emergency and are tied to a final rule that will be released in December 2020, which will leave ACOs only one month to transition to the new reporting method.\nFrom a broad perspective, Ochsner believes that ACOs should not be evaluated and assessed in the same manner as all other APMs or individual MIPS clinicians who are not participating in total cost of care and full accountability payment models. It is also unclear how CMS determined that the APP measures are more appropriate the current APM quality measures. The proposed one size fits all approach does not take into consideration the spectrum and variability between MIPS APM programs where each APM has specific goals and objectives or create a set of measures that better inform patients. For example, it does not make clinical sense for the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced, or BPCI-A, to be compared and measured on the same set of measures that apply to the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) participants. Quality measurement with APM programs should focus on measures most appropriate for the individual program and hold health care providers and organizations accountable for the quality and cost of care.\nOchsner recommends that CMS postpone making any structural changes to how ACO quality is assessed and reported until at least 2022 or 2023 and work with stakeholders to develop the best balanced, fair and technically sound quality measures. In the meantime, we urge CMS to maintain the current APM Scoring Standard approach. While the proposed revision to ACO quality measures may reduce administrative burden, they significantly alter and narrow the lens through which quality is assessed. The proposed six APP measures are a drastic reduction from the 23 measures currently used to assess ACOs. We believe the proposal goes too far by reducing the number of clinical quality measures to only three measures focused on controlling diabetes and high blood pressure and screening for depression. We recommend that CMS retain several important preventative care quality measures that are a strength of the current set of quality measures and have been proven to improve patient outcomes, including: ACO-14, Influenza Immunization; ACO-19,\nColorectal Cancer Screening; ACO 20, Breast Cancer Screening; and, the previously used Pneumonia Vaccination measure.\nWe also have significant concerns that two of the six quality measures are focused on All-Cause Unplanned Hospital Admissions and Readmissions. The unplanned readmissions measure has a very narrow band where there is less that a 1 percent difference between the 30th percentile and the 90th percentile for the 2020 benchmark targets for ACO-8, Risk Standardized, All Condition Readmission. As a result, small differences in readmissions can result in drastic differences in quality scores that are not meaningful or an accurate reflection of an ACO's quality improvement efforts. Further, since the ACO program already provides direct financial incentives to reduce avoidable hospital admissions and readmissions, we do not believe it is appropriate to have onethird of the total measure set linked to these utilization measures. In response, Ochsner recommends that CMS postpone any significant changes in ACO quality measures until 2022 or 2023 and utilize the interim period to consult with the ACO community and patient representatives to determine the most appropriate set of measures that will lead to meaningful improvements in the quality of care.", "97": "Ochsner opposes this all-or nothing approach to shared savings, particularly surrounding the use of the proposed hospital readmissions measure with an extremely narrow bands in performance percentiles. Instead, should CMS move forward with its redesigned quality assessment structure for ACOs, we recommend that CMS use a scoring method similar to the current domain-based scoring approach. For example, CMS could instead consider a policy that would use a minimum attainment requiring 50 percent of the quality measures to meet or exceed the 40th percentile, which must also be done in concert with our recommendations to add additional clinical quality measures to the measure set currently proposed by CMS. Setting the standard at 50 percent ensures that ACOs perform well on a substantial set of measures to earn shared savings but does not punish ACOs that may fall below the performance threshold on a measure that is not as relevant to their patient population or has a very narrow range of performance percentiles, such as the proposed hospital readmissions measure.", "98": "The proposed Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) quality measures are the right\nmeasures; however, the percentile scoring system creates too narrow a range and\nheightens disparities in health care - an alternative is needed;\n\u25cf 2021 is not the right time to change MSSP reporting methods as the new method would\nrequire implementation in January 2021, not February 2022 when the report is due;", "104": "Quality Performance Standard and Shared Savings Determination\nCMS proposes to increase the quality performance standard by raising the current minimum attainment\nlevel from the 30th percentile to the 40th percentile.

A lower number of measures also means that there is more weight placed on only a few quality measures.\nWe have reviewed the proposed quality measures and agree with the continuing to report on the proposed Preventive Health and At Risk Population measures. However, we would request more information on the CAHPS measures such as will the current 2019/2020 CAHPS measures continue in 2021? One MHA member has participated in CMMI ACO risk programs since 2012 and because of the subjective nature of the survey our overall patient experience domain score has varied significantly through the years.\nPatient experience is an important part of the triple aim to evaluate and should be included in these measures, however there is concern that reducing the number of overall measures puts disproportionate weight on the CAHPS for ACO survey results.\nThe proposed 2021 quality measures also include 2 claims measures from the Care Coordination/Patient Safety domain. An MHA member ACO would also like to provide feedback on these 2 measures as 2 of the 6 proposed measures. This member has found that there is a lot of variation for their results related to the Risk Standardized 30-Day Readmissions measure. Benchmarks for the claims based measures are very tight. Numerators and denominators are relatively small, which means that if a few additional patients are admitted or readmitted (depending on the measure), results can easily swing from passing to failing. We would suggest evaluating how the benchmarks are set for the claims-based measures. We would also like the readmissions benchmark to be evaluated considering the CMS Hospital Readmission Penalty Program has determined to remove at least Q1 and Q2 2020 readmissions from their performance data. Additionally, we would like more information on if adjustments will be made for the ACO Readmission data, both exclusions and benchmarking impact.\nThe measure Risk Standardized All- Cause Admissions for Patients with Chronic Conditions is also very challenging to address and track during the year. The same MHA member ACO as above reports that it has tried to create a proxy measure to track how we are performing on this measure, however they have not been able to do that for the following reasons. There are a total of 8 conditions in this measure and the patient has to have at least 2 of the 8 to be in the numerator. They have not been able to duplicate the same risk-adjustment methodology to compare their results to how they would be measured. Their ACO has multiple interventions in place to address the needs of patients with chronic conditions, however their results for this measure do not always reflect this.

We urge CMS to introduce a transition year and finalize any changes to the\nreporting mechanism no earlier than CY 2022 to allow providers adequate time to adapt,\nparticularly given they continue to grapple with the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on their\noperations. Earlier, CMS accepted public comment (from HCTTF and others) requesting a delay in\nimplementing the MIPS Value Pathways due to the readiness of clinicians in making this transition.\nThe same leniency afforded MIPS-eligible clinicians should be afforded to ACOs. We appreciate that CMS has proposed better alignment between the reporting\nrequirements for MIPS and Advanced APMs, which creates a better glidepath for providers for\nproviders looking to transition away from fee-for-service. The Task Force has long encouraged\nCMS to establish a parsimonious set of quality measures and better alignment across APMs and\nquality reporting programs. The smaller, more focused APM Performance Pathway (APP) measure\nset is appropriate to count for both ACO and MIPS reporting as APM Entities are incentivized\nthrough the terms of the respective APM agreements to improve value. However, we are\nconcerned that in reducing the set of measures, CMS has removed all preventative health\nmeasures, instead shifting the focus entirely to management of illness and cost rather than\nprevention. Of particular concern during the COVID pandemic, the measures selected do not\nallow ACOs to report results during telehealth visits. CMS should consider inclusion of quality\nmeasures that are foundational to preventive care and care coordination, as well quality measures\nfor services performed via telehealth.\nAdditionally, not all providers in ACOs will meet the threshold for Qualified Advanced\nAPMs Participants, and the alignment between MIPS and MSSP reporting requirements creates\nan easier pathway to move away from fee-for-service and advance to shared risk models.\nHowever, we are concerned that the APP approach is not appropriate for all APM participants\n(additional feedback below).", "122": "CMS is proposing to revise the MSSP quality performance standard beginning with the\n2021 performance year by implementing a higher quality performance standard where ACOs\nwould now be required to receive a Quality performance score equivalent to or above the 40th\npercentile across all MIPS Quality performance category scores in order to share in savings or\navoid owing maximum losses. It is critical to the success of delivery system reform that quality of\ncare continues to improve over time along with expectations of cost savings. However, HCTTF\ndoes not support implementation of this policy in 2021 as providers still manage and recover\nfrom the pandemic and are without pre-established benchmarks to measure against. The Task\nForce also opposes the proposal to eliminate the pay-for-reporting year. ACOs use the pay-forreporting year to prepare and document measures appropriately.

Responding to that proposal, we stated that -\ngiven the massive shifts in care delivery sites and staffing, increased telehealth utilization, data collection challenges and other COVID-19 related impacts in 2020 - we did not believe that the\napplication of either an average quality score or individual ACO quality score based on data from\nthe 2020 performance year would be feasible or appropriate. The Task Force appreciates CMS\u2019s\nattention to this issue and believes the plan proposed here is a reasonable compromise on this\nissue.", "126": "CMS is proposing to decrease the number of measures from 23 to 6, and the number of actively reportable measures from 10 to 3. The proposed APP would replace the current Shared Savings program quality measure set to simplify reporting requirements. The new APP framework would also be weighted different, with quality accounting for 50 percent, PI accounting for 30 percent, IA accounting for 20 percent, and cost accounting for 0 percent. ACOs would be scored on the measures they choose to report but would receive zero points for those they do not report. Further, CMS proposes to remove the phase in approach for quality reporting. Regardless of performance year and agreement period, all ACOs would be scored on the same 3 actively reportable quality measures: 1) Diabetes: Hemoglobin A1C Poor Control (>9%); 2) Preventive Care and Screening: Screening for Depression and Follow-Up Plan; and 3) Controlling High Blood Pressure. While we appreciate the more streamlined measures for quality reporting and decreasing the total number, 2 of the 3 measures (A1c and controlling high blood pressure) are not appropriate for this patient population. Current measures in the MSSP, as well as other Medicare programs and models, are not clinically appropriate or applicable to a frail, seriously ill, and home-limited patient population (i.e., those treated by home care medicine practices). We are concerned that even though physicians are delivering high-touch, high-quality, and clinically appropriate care to this medically complex patient population, they are penalized under these programs due to the quality measures. Additionally, this deters others from participating in the program. Thus, we urge CMS to adopt a more clinically appropriate measure set that is inclusive of complex, chronic care patients. We recommend 2 replacement measures from the Home Based Primary and Palliative Care Data Registry: 1) Telephone Contact, Virtual, or In-person Visit Within 48 Hours of Hospital Discharge of Home-Based Primary Care and Palliative Care Patients, and 2) Medication Reconciliation within 2 Weeks of Hospital Discharge of Home-Based Primary Care and Palliative Care Patients. Additionally, we request that CMS review the following publication that identifies large gaps in which home visits are not included in meaningful measures: To What Extent Are the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2019 MIPS Quality Measures Inclusive of Home-Based Medical Care? We would be happy to meet and discuss further with the Agency.", "128": "CMS is proposing to include certain codes for technical changes to the definition of primary care starting January 1, 2021. CMS is proposing to revise the following primary care services codes to account for online digital E/M, assessment of and care planning for patients with cognitive impairment, chronic care management, non-complex chronic care management, principal care management, and psychiatric collaborative care management. CMS defines online digital evaluation, or e-visits, to be non-face-to-face, patient-initiated communications using online patient portals. The chronic disease management code requires two or more chronic conditions that place the patient at a significant risk of death or co-morbidities. Other requirements are applied to the following new codes: non-complex chronic care management, principal care management, and psychiatric collaborative care management. We are supportive of this proposal to update the definition of primary care services. We support the inclusion of the HCPCS code G2010 (virtual communication) as well.", "133": "CMS proposes to establish two policies that would allow certain ACOs to benefit from a lower repayment mechanism amount than would otherwise be required under the current regulations. The first policy would apply prospectively to any renewing ACO that uses an existing repayment mechanism to establish its ability to repay any shared losses incurred for performance years in its new agreement Page 19 period. The second policy would permit certain ACOs whose agreement periods began July 1, 2019 or January 1, 2020 to elect to reduce the amount of their repayment mechanisms. We appreciate CMS\u2019s ongoing efforts to minimize burdens associated with the repayment mechanism. We support both of CMS\u2019s repayment proposals and encourage the agency to finalize them as proposed. At the same time, we also encourage the agency to take additional steps to further reduce the burdens associated with repayment mechanism requirements. Many ACOs cite the burden and cost of securing a repayment mechanism as primary barriers against moving to a risk-based ACO model. To eliminate third party transactional fees that detract from investments in patient care, we urge CMS to remove the repayment mechanism requirement when an ACO can demonstrate that it has an investor or financial backer with a high credit rating. Financial backers could include outside investors, insurers, or hospitals or health systems that are aligned with the ACO and committed to providing financial support should losses occur. This flexibility would protect ACOs\u2019 finances, as well as the federal fisc, and eliminate the need for a 24-month tail period, which is an additional burden on ACOs. At the very least, if CMS continues to require a repayment mechanism, we encourage the agency to minimize associated regulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for a tail period, which is increasingly important in light of longer agreement periods.", "134": "AAHPM appreciates CMS\u2019 interest in developing a reporting mechanism for MIPS APM participants that would reduce reporting burden and encourage continued APM participation under its proposed APM Performance Pathway (APP), as well as in streamlining reporting requirements for participants under the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP). However, we believe CMS missed an important opportunity to encourage appropriate care for patients by failing to propose measure #47, Advance Care Plan, in the APP quality measure set. As noted above, advance care planning services are essential to ensuring high-quality care for Medicare beneficiaries, particularly those with serious illness or at the end of life. These discussions enable care teams to understand patients\u2019 values and goals in order to guide decisions about care and treatment. Studies show that advance care planning also leads to higher patient and family satisfaction with quality of care, less hospitalization, less intensity of treatment near end of life, more hospice use, and a higher likelihood of patients dying in their preferred place, as well as less stress, anxiety, and depression in surviving caregivers. For these reasons, we believe that CMS should hold MSSP and MIPS APM participants accountable for performance on the Advance Care Plan measure under the APP. We note that this would align with actions CMS has taken for other models, where it has recognized the importance of advance care planning services in several models currently underway. For example, the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced model assesses participant performance on this measure across all clinical episodes. Likewise, the Medicare Advantage Value-Based Insurance Design (MA VBID) model also requires all participating Medicare Advantage organizations to develop and implement a strategy regarding the delivery of timely AAHPM CMS-1734-P October 5, 2020 11 Wellness and Health Care Planning (WHP) services, including advance care planning services, to all enrollees. Otherwise, we note that it is difficult for AAHPM to assess CMS\u2019 APP proposal given the lack of information on participation in MIPS APMs and Advanced APMs by specialty. AAHPM strongly encourages CMS to increase transparency regarding the extent of specialty participation in each MIPS APM and Advanced APM by including data on specialty-level participation in such models in the annual QPP Experience Report or through annual rulemaking.", "136": "Proposal to replace current SSP Quality Measure Set with APP Quality Measure Set We support CMS\u2019 efforts to develop quality measure sets that reduce clinician burden and avoid low value measures. However, we have concerns about the APP measure set. First, preventive care is a central mission of SSP ACOs and we are concerned that exclusion of foundational preventive care measures such as ACO-19 (Colorectal Cancer Screening) and ACO- 20 (Breast Cancer Screening) removes an important mechanism for accurately evaluating the impact of SSP ACOs on population health. Second, we are concerned that one third of the measures under the APP are related to utilization (Hospital-Wide, 30-Day, All-Cause Unplanned Readmission (HWR) Rate for the MIPS Eligible Clinician Groups and All-Cause Unplanned Admissions for Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC)). Such a heavy emphasis on utilization in the APP quality set is unnecessary given the direct financial incentive to control utilization in the SSP, and also given that the measurement of quality performance would be better served through preventive care measures as described above. Additionally, the HWR and MCC measures have tight performance distributions. As a result, small differences in quality that may be due to natural statistical variation rather than care delivery can have disproportionate impacts on program performance, resulting in quality scores that do not accurately reflect SSP ACO quality.", "137": "Changes to quality thresholds We support CMS\u2019 aim to drive improvements in the quality of care furnished by ACOs, and we generally support raising quality performance thresholds over time. We support the proposal for ACOs who completely report and are at or above the 40th percentile to receive the full maximum savings rate. We believe this supports CMS\u2019 stated goal of encouraging APM participation, and will act as a quality improvement incentive. If the proposal to raise the minimum attainment level from the 30th percentile to the 40th percentile is finalized, we recommend applying this as an average of all measures rather than to each measure individually. This is important both because of the concerns with the APP quality measures described above, and because the all-or-nothing approach proposed will create circumstances in which ACOs fail to share in savings through natural statistical variation rather than true poor performance. For example, an ACO in the 39th percentile on one quality measure but in the 95th percentile on all others may be locked out of shared savings completely. We are concerned about this all-or-nothing approach and are certain that such an abrupt cutoff will deter APM participation. Accordingly, we recommend that if an ACO completely reports and does not meet the Minimum Performance Level, the maximum shared savings rate should be multiplied by the quality score as it is today. In this way the ACO will receive shared savings proportionate to their quality performance, and ACOs that do not meet the threshold for a measure with narrow distribution or due to natural statistical variation will not be unduly punished.", "138": "Proposal to change the MSSP Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Policy for ACOs We support the proposal to change the MSSP Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Policy for ACOs to set the minimum quality performance score for affected ACOs to equal the higher of the ACO\u2019s quality score or the 40th percentile MIPS Quality performance category score.", "141": "Proposal to expand definition of primary care services for MSSP beneficiary assignment Accurate beneficiary assignment is critical for ACOs to effectively manage quality and cost for the populations we serve. We appreciate CMS\u2019 ongoing attention to improving beneficiary attribution methodology. Accordingly, we support CMS\u2019 proposal to expand the definition of primary care services for beneficiary assignment to include various telehealth codes and Chronic Care Management. We also support the exclusion of Advance Care Planning codes billed in inpatient settings from assignment methodology. Telehealth Regulatory flexibilities related to telehealth have helped us continue to provide high quality care to our patients during the pandemic, and we thank CMS for quickly enacting these changes. The pandemic has forever altered health care delivery, and for this reason we strongly recommend that CMS make permanent the telehealth flexibilities extended during the PHE.", "142": "Although we do not know the total impact, our biggest concern with removing the Web Interface as a reporting mechanism is cost. To report similar CQM type measures, large practices are left only with registry reporting as an option, if they are not set up to report via EHR. The majority of QCDR or QRs charge per provider and that could have a SIGNIFICANT budgetary impact on these practices. Alerting these practices in late 2020, would not give them enough time to change budgets and participation strategies already set for next year. If CMS opts to finalize its proposal to sunset the Web Interface reporting option, we request that it at least delay this decision by a year to give practices time to prepare for this transition.", "143": "In this rule, CMS proposed to establish an Alternative Payment Pathway (APP) under which an eligible clinician participating in Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) could meet the quality reporting requirements of the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) by reporting on one set of quality measures. We have long supported streamlining requirements for providers in at-risk arrangements and have suggested in the past that providers participating in these arrangements should be allowed to report fewer quality measures.", "144": "We applaud CMS\u2019s proposal to remove the CMS Web Interface collection type. We agree with CMS\u2019s comments in the proposed rule that there is a need for specific-specialty information from large multispecialty groups. Under the current MIPS program, these large multispecialty groups report only primary care measures on a limited number of patients under the Web Interface reporting method. It is important that CMS require specialty reporting from these large groups to ensure accountability for the quality of specialty care at large multi-specialty practices. We strongly support requiring large multi-specialty groups to report on specialty measures, and we further ask CMS to encourage participation among these large groups in specialty-led QCDRs. Specialty-led QCDRs provide a valuable and unique source of specialty-specific quality data that is not collected elsewhere and is critical to understanding the entire value equation. Without incentives for large, multi-specialty practices to report on specialty-specific quality metrics, CMS is limiting the performance data available to patients regarding the quality of care that specialty doctors provide. We believe this undermines CMS\u2019s efforts to encourage specialists to meaningfully engage in MIPS.", "145": "In November of 2017, CMS published an Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances (EUC) Interim Final Rule in response to the wildfires and Hurricanes Maria, Irma, and Harvey. The Academy applauds CMS\u2019s continued commitment to ensuring that clinicians affected by major disasters receive automatic extreme and uncontrollable circumstances exceptions, we are concerned, however, that the policy is not being applied as finalized. The policy, as finalized, provided automatic MIPS extreme and uncontrollable circumstances hardship exemptions to clinicians impacted by a CMS-designated extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, including FEMA-declared major disasters and CMS-declared emergencies. When CMS finalized that the exception would be automatic, the rationale was that clinicians in these areas are already burdened by major disaster and caring for vulnerable patients who are also vulnerable after major disasters. While the Academy appreciates CMS\u2019s desire to encourage quality reporting under MIPS, we are concerned with CMS\u2019s approach of not applying the automatic EUC policy to the COVID19 public health emergency (PHE) in performance year 2020. CMS has identified COVID-19 as a current emergency, FEMA has declared COVID-19 to be a major disaster across the country, and CMS is applying the EUC policy automatically to MSSP organizations that do not report or inadequately report quality during the 2020 performance year due to COVID19. We would also note that CMS provided an automatic EUC to clinicians that did not report 2019 MIPS due to the COVID-19 PHE. 8 We would highlight that the reporting period took place near the beginning of the pandemic\u2019s course in the United States. Since that time, the healthcare sector\u2019s financial stability has negatively impacted by the reduction or cessation of elective procedures and a sharp decline in outpatient visits (in person or telehealth).3 Most practices have had to lay off or furlough clinical workers and administrative staff to remain open.4,5 It will take years for the healthcare sector to recover. Despite this, and despite the likely significant impacts the pandemic and resultant delays in care will have on quality performance, CMS has stated that the COVID-19 PHE does not qualify for the automatic EUC. With so many healthcare providers struggling financially to stay open and expending all of their focus on the patients who need them, removing the potential for an up to 9% penalty for providers that are truly struggling could allow them to remain open. The more practices that close, the further increased barriers to care will be, which would greatly decrease care quality, particularly during a pandemic. We encourage CMS to apply the automatic MIPS EUC policy to the COVID-19 PHE for the 2020 MIPS performance year to allow clinicians to be able to focus on the COVID-19 PHE and their patients without worrying.", "146": "Health eFilings supports CMS\u2019 proposal to establish an APM Performance Pathway (APP). Aligning the reporting under the MIPS program provides more consistent and reliable information and by implementing the proposals related to APP reporting, CMS will eliminate the burden certain organizations were subject to through the requirements of reporting through the web interface for a greater number of Quality Measures than practices not participating within an APM. In addition, the alignment of APP reporting with the MIPS program will minimize the barrier of practices transitioning to an APM. [...]\nHealth eFilings agrees with CMS\u2019 proposal to eliminate the CMS Web Interface reporting option. As previously stated, we agree that moving towards a consistent methodology for reporting, especially ones that further the objective of CMS to increase the utilization of technology like CEHRT, will reduce clinician burden and provide CMS with more reliable data.", "147": "While Health eFilings supports the proposal to align APM reporting to traditional MIPS reporting, the inclusion of two Administrative Claims measures is counterproductive to CMS\u2019 goal of utilizing technology to improve patient care and reduce costs. CMS has previously stated that desire to remove silos from the MIPS program. Health eFilings commends CMS for including eCQMs within the APP Quality Measures and recommends that CMS build upon this by replacing the Administrative Claims measures with eCQMs. The eCQMs fundamentally tie the use of technology to the Quality category by encouraging the proper use of EHRs. Additionally, this provides the benefit of increased reliability on the data based upon not having human manipulation or intervention between the documentation and reporting to CMS. Under MIPS, CMS has eliminated claims-based reporting for large practices due to the data not being reliable or cost-effective for a practice to capture. Including Administrative Claims measures within the APM reporting is counterintuitive to this and eCQMs could better serve CMS\u2019 needs within the APM reporting Quality measure list.", "148": "We have participated in the several rulemaking cycles related to the MSSP, most recently with the\nPathways to Success initiative in CY 2019.15 Here the Agency makes numerous proposals related to the\nMSSP, some for PY2020 and PY2021 in relation to the PHE, and others for subsequent PYs beyond the\npresumed conclusion of the PHE.16 We do not address each of these in detail here, but rather direct the\nAgency to public commentary submitted by our colleagues at NAACOS, AAMC, and AHA. In short, we\ngenerally support efforts to bring MSSP calculations, including benchmarking, attribution, quality\nmeasurement, and financial performance, into line with the Medicare program as transformed by\nthe PHE and its related waivers. In particular, we commend the Agency for its proposals to expand\nprimary care services to include those provided virtually under a waiver, and to factor those services into\nattribution calculations for individual beneficiaries and participating ACOs. We strongly recommend\nthe Agency forego any other changes for PY2020 or PY2021 given the uncertain duration of the\nPHE and the potential for future waivers or other rulemaking (or Congressional action) to address\na pandemic possibly persisting beyond PY2021. Permanent changes for PY2022 can be considered\nnext year, assuming the PHE\u2019s conclusion is at least in sight.", "151": "As noted above, Ascension\u2019s MSSP ACOs were also able to leverage CMS\u2019s expanded definition of\n\u201cprimary care services\u201d, which temporarily includes codes for virtual check-ins, e-visits, and telephone\ncommunication, for purposes of establishing and maintaining patient attribution to ACOs. This has\nallowed for more accurate assignment of beneficiaries throughout the pandemic. And since we\nanticipate that these services will continue to be readily offered by our ACO clinicians and utilized by\nbeneficiaries, we strongly support CMS\u2019s proposal to make permanent this revised definition.\nWe also echo the recommendation made by NAACOS that CMS use a two-year assignment window for\nMSSP to account for potential variations in attribution in 2020 and 2021. Changes in patient behavior in\nresponse to concerns about COVID-19, and especially in light of the upcoming flu season, have resulted\nin healthy patients forgoing and continuing to forgo routine primary care. These behavioral shifts will\ninvariably impact assignment for MSSP ACOs, regardless of whether they use retrospective or\nprospective attribution. We therefore encourage CMS to consider patient visits from both 2019 and\n2020 for purposes of all ACOs\u2019 assignment lists. This will help create more consistent and accurate\nassignment lists.", "152": "We appreciate CMS\u2019s ongoing efforts to minimize burdens associated with the repayment mechanism.\nWe support both of CMS\u2019s repayment proposals and encourage the agency to finalize them as\nproposed.

At the very least,\nif CMS continues to require a repayment mechanism, we encourage the agency to minimize associated\nregulatory and financial burden by removing the requirement for a tail period, which is increasingly\nimportant in light of longer agreement periods.", "153": "CMS proposes to retire the CMS Web Interface. Under this policy, ACOs would be required to report\nelectronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs) via an Electronic Health Record (EHR) or MIPS CQMs\nvia a qualified registry or Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR).\nWe recommend that the sunsetting of the CMS Web Interface be delayed. This will allow providers\nmore time to prepare for a full year of data collection using an alternate submission method\nthrough the EHR. Waiving the HCAHPS 2020 Survey\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS is proposing several flexibilities for MSSP to help alleviate the\nburden on providers. These flexibilities include automatically giving all providers full points for the\nHospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) within the patient\nexperience domain for performance year 2020.\nWhile AHPA supports the proposal to waive the HCAHPS survey for 2020, we request that CMS\nfinalize this policy before this final rule is released either through a separate guidance or\nmemorandum. HCAHPS surveys are scheduled to be sent out to patients around December, which is the\nsame time period in which the final rule is expected to be released. Without a finalized policy, providers\nand vendors will be pressured to launch the survey, as they will not know with certainty whether CMS\nwill finalize the proposed policy. Knowing CMS\u2019 final policy earlier will allow providers and vendors to\nbetter manage their resources.\nRevising the Methodology Used to Assign Beneficiaries to ACOs\nDuring the COVID-19 PHE, CMS added to the definition of primary care used in the MSSP assignment\nmethodology codes for remote evaluations, virtual check-ins, e-visits and telephone E/M services. CMS\nconsidered but ultimately declined to propose adding these codes on a permanent basis.\nAHPA requests that CMS reconsider this proposal and would recommend adding these codes on a\npermanent basis to assign beneficiaries in MSSP. We believe the pandemic has changed how primary\ncare is delivered and believe that patients will continue to demand and expect reduced barriers to\ntelehealth access.\nAssigning Doctors in MSSP on a National Provider Identification Level\nAHPA also recommends that CMS assign doctors to an MSSP program on a National Provider\nIdentifier (NPI) level rather than on a Tax Identification Number (TIN) level. Currently, the MSSP\nprogram aligns physicians at the TIN level, which makes it hard for groups to exclude certain types of\nproviders that are not well suited for case management. The inclusion of these types of providers,\nincluding transplant surgeons, oncologists, anesthesiologists and hospitalists, discourages some groups\nfrom participating in MSSP. To reduce the attrition rate in the program, CMS should consider structuring\nthe program similarly to the Direct Contracting model, which uses NPIs to target the right type of\nprovider. This would also prevent overlap between the Direct Contracting model and MSSP.", "154": "There has already been significant changes to the structure of the MSSP program through the\nimplementation of the New Pathways approach. Additional changes, particularly changes to\nmeasurements, significantly disrupt ACOs as they continue to adapt to a new program structure.\nImplementing such changes during the PHE only complicate matters. This is not to say we\noppose modification to and evolution of the program \u2013 rather, we support meaningful review and\nchanges that are difficult to develop and measure during the ongoing PHE.\nWe urge CMS to not set any date certain to move forward with revisions at this time.\nRather, we encourage CMS to utilize a separate request for information to gather\nstakeholder input once the PHE emergency concludes. This will allow for adequate review\nand consideration of suggested revisions and weighting of appropriate measures.\nMore specifically, CMS has proposed to end the use of the Web Interface reporting option as\nwell as removing the pay-for reporting year. Both the AHA and National Association of ACOs\n(NAACOS) outline substantial concerns with these two items. We echo their concerns.\nCMS is proposing to eliminate the Web Interface reporting option because its use outside of the\nMSSP program is limited. As the program is intended to improve the care for Medicare\nbeneficiaries, utilizing a different reporting system that includes all-payer data is questionable.\nAdditionally, MSSP has different measure specifications which could result in different scores\neven when reporting the same measure title. Unfortunately, we do not believe the proposal addresses how to reconcile potential performance differences among ACOs that may stem from\ndifferences in data collection types.\nAdditionally, CMS is proposing to eliminate the pay-for-reporting for first year of MSSP\nparticipation, as we well as pay-for-reporting for newly added or significantly revised measures.\nPay-for-reporting periods give ACOs the opportunity to ramp up their measurement and\nimprovement capabilities in a sustainable fashion before their shared services or losses are tied to\nquality performance. Significant changes to existing measure specifications require providers to\nmake several of these same adaptations. As MSSP ACOs are scored on improvement over time,\nit is essential to establish an accurate performance baseline, thus necessitating the continuation of\npay-for-reporting.\nWe urge CMS to continue both the existing Web Interface reporting option and pay-forreporting", "155": "Integra appreciates CMS\u2019s efforts to streamline the scoring and reporting under the new APM\nPerformance Pathway (APP).

While we understand that this proposal for the participation in an APP will be optional, this is a brand new pathway to providers and may be confusing with other changes of sunsetting the APM scoring standard, CMS web interface measures, and adding the MIPS APM type to the participation statuses.\nGreenway supports sun-setting the APM scoring standard and adding MIPS APM type to the participation statuses under MIPS, which aligns with the sunset of the CMS web interface measures.

For this reason, we request CMS permit APMs to report via the APP or Web Interface in PY2021 to allow additional time for APMs to implement the health information technology needed to report via APP.

In addition to the potential for reduced sample size, we anticipate a high \u201cskip\u201d rate as urgent or emergent care encounters have replaced some preventive care visits during the PHE. For this reason, we request CMS reduce the sample size commensurate with the reduction in ambulatory services (roughly 15%-20% based on analysis by Milliman) as a result of the PHE, and wave the \u201cskip\u201d rate thresholds for PY2020 reporting.\nIn addition, given that repayment of PY2019 losses are due during the PHE, we request CMS extend the \u201cExtreme and Uncontrollable Circumstance Policy\u201d to reduce or wave the repayment of PY2019 losses until the PHE has ended.

However, we have significant concerns with moving to the Alternative Payment Model Performance Pathway (APP) for the 2021 performance year and thus respectfully urge CMS to delay this transition until after the conclusion of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE).\nFirst, we feel the timeline is too aggressive and does not offer participants enough time for transition. Asking ACOs to shift to a new platform for the 2021 performance year places an undue administrative burden on organizations already struggling to cope with the myriad challenges posed by the COVID-19 PHE. We are particularly concerned that losing the current submission option will create undue additional work and financial burden for ACOs with participants using multiple types of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). As there is significant preparation needed on the operations and logistical side for this data system migration, we feel that the move from the Web Interface to the new platform should incorporate a more gradual on-ramp than the timeline proposed by CMS. A more protracted transition period critically would allow ACOs the time they need to engage with any needed new vendors, work with multiple EMR companies, create workflows that sustain the new data collection process, and implement any other changes that are necessary to successfully transition to the new platform. AAH strongly shares the agency\u2019s goal of promoting and fostering a successful ACO program; however, movement to the APP while ACOs continue to address the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic simply does not create the optimal structure for success and therefore AAH respectfully urges CMS to delay the transition to APP beyond the 2021 performance year.\nSecond, it is our understanding the Electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs) and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) CQMs require data submissions on all patients, all payors. However, due to privacy protections, ACOs cannot have access to patient information outside of their attributed MSSP patients. This new data submission process therefore provides a layer of complexity and potential liability for ACOs to report all patients, all payors. Thus, AAH respectfully urges CMS to rescind this requirement and not put ACOs in a situation that poses privacy compliance concerns.", "185": "We would appreciate clarity from CMS regarding what the agency intends by achieving \u201ca quality performance score equivalent to the 40th percentile or above across all MIPS Quality performance category scores.\u201d If ACOs will be required to achieve a score at or above the 40th percentile for each of the six measures, we are extremely concerned that the proposed new Quality Performance Standard will be far too stringent and will have the unintended consequence of driving otherwise successful ACOs out of the program \u2013 clearly not a goal of the agency. If, on the other hand, CMS intends with the proposal that ACOs will receive a composite score and ranking, such an approach may be more feasible and less punitive. Regardless, we would require additional details regarding the scoring methodology before we can understand and support this proposed change.", "186": "We also respectfully oppose the proposed removal of the pay-for-reporting year for newly formed ACOs and for new/updated measures. We recognize that often when first engaging in quality reporting the effort is more about data collection than it is about the quality of care provided. Clinicians, systems, and ACOs require adequate time and resources to implement workflows so that data can be appropriately collected and accurately capture the care provided \u2013 and for providers to review and understand the data to help inform quality improvement efforts going forward. The pay-for-reporting year and for individual measure changes importantly provides this ramp up opportunity for ACOs to be successful with quality reporting. This appropriate and necessary transitional year helps to ensure there are no unintended consequences or flaws in the measure\u2019s specifications before holding an ACO accountable for performance in the measure. Indeed, removing pay-for-reporting only places additional burden on those providing care by requiring new reporting without resources to support it. Thus, AAH respectfully urges CMS to not go forward with its proposal to remove the pay-for-reporting year for newly formed ACOs and for new/updated measures.", "187": "We are pleased that CMS is proposing the permanent inclusion of certain telehealth codes in the definition of primary care services for the purposes of beneficiary assignment.

In place of the Web Interface, the APP would require ACOs to actively report on\nthree clinical quality measures, which could be reported using a registry or direct via\nelectronic health records (EHRs) using electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM)\nstandards. These eCQMs must be reported for all patients, regardless of payer.\n\nComments: CMS proposes to abruptly end the use of the Web Interface reporting\nmechanism, a tool that has been used since the MSSP\u2019s inception. Removing this option for\nthe NHN ACO with little notice is ill-timed and unfair.\nCMS has not been clear regarding how the alternative MIPS reporting options will be\nutilized for ACOs (as APM Entities) specifically. There are several key questions and\nobstacles to moving away from this reporting method in this timeframe. For example, the\ncurrent remaining MIPS reporting options available under the APP would be registry (MIPS\nCQMs) and EHR (eCQMs). Using these reporting options would result in the NHN being\nevaluated on quality for all patients the NHN\u2019s providers serve, not only ACO assigned\npatients. This is not a true evaluation of the ACO\u2019s quality efforts and, additionally, raises\ncontractual and legal concerns, as an ACO may not have the ability to access patient data\nfor non-ACO patients. NHN providers have invested significant resources for development\nof reporting processes and workflows to optimize this process; removing web interface\nreporting option altogether would undermine these investments, thus diverting critical\nresources away from improving patient care.\nAdditionally, CMS has not stated if aggregation of data and performance calculations will\nhappen at the CMS level. Current Web Interface reporting allows for aggregation of\nperformance across the ACO and supports one data file submission. Reporting via the\neCQM method may not be possible if ACO participants have differing electronic medical\nrecords (EMRs). Current state eCQM reporting creates an aggregate report per TIN. ACOs\ncan have many different participating TINs, all of which could have different EMRs. If\naggregation of data and performance doesn\u2019t happen at the CMS level, ACOs would need\nto employ a third party data aggregation vendor in order to submit one data file at the APM\nentity level. This could add additional cost to ACOs.\nCMS should consider a transition away from the Web Interface reporting option, once\nconsideration is given to performance aggregation at the APM entity level and the option to\nreport eCQMs for only the attributed beneficiaries and not all patients and payers. This\nwould align with current structure of reporting only attributed beneficiaries while moving\nACOs away from Web Interface reporting. For example, CMS should work with industry\nleaders to create QRDAIII aggregate TIN level reporting for assigned beneficiaries. Then,\neach TIN would submit the QRDA III file via the QPP website and CMS would calculate\nperformance scores for the APM entity. Currently, practice level reporting is utilized for\nCPC+ and the upcoming Primary Care First model.\nFor these reasons, Nebraska Medicine urges CMS to provide a more gradual transition\naway from the use of the Web Interface reporting option to give more time and thought to\nhow this will practically be implemented and to give our ACO and our providers more time to\nassess alternatives.", "210": "While we appreciate CMS\u2019 efforts to reduce the reporting burden by developing a common\nset of quality measures regardless of which APM model a clinician or group participates in,\nwe are concerned that these measures will not capture the variability that exists between\ndifferent specialties.

Providers should not be subject to payment incentives or penalties\nin performance periods where circumstances beyond their control may impact\nperformance.", "213": "Caravan Health has formed and managed ACOs in the Medicare Shared Savings Program since 2014. We\nsupport more than 600,000 attributed Medicare beneficiaries in the MSSP, with 200,000 enrolled in Pathways to\nSuccess in 2020. Overall, we support many of the proposals in the latest PFS/QPP rule. In particular, extending access to\ntelehealth and virtual care will be invaluable for our clients, many of them rural, who have come to rely on\nvirtual care to maintain ongoing management of chronic disease and prevention. We also appreciate that CMS is\nrecognizing the value of office-based evaluation and management (E/M) services by increasing reimbursement.\nThis increased reimbursement appropriately reflects the time-intensive nature of these services, particularly\nwhen managing patients with serious chronic medical conditions.", "214": "However, we have concerns several of the proposals in the rule. Dramatically streamlining the number of quality\nmeasures on which ACOs will be assessed, as well as the drastic changes to the method by which ACOs are\nassessed, will have negative effects on the program. The value proposition of ACOs requires that they can\ndistinguish themselves on the excellent care provided, as well as cost-efficiency. Reducing the number of\nmeasures to 6, from the previous 23, makes it more difficult for ACOs to stand out and earn MIPS bonuses and\nshared savings. While it may be appropriate to reduce the burden on providers from reporting quality measures,\nwe are concerned that alternative payment models (APMs) would be disadvantaged compared to MIPS-eligible\nclinicians not participating in APMs. Similarly, making changes to the methods for submitting data during a\npublic health emergency puts inappropriate and undue burden on providers.", "215": "ACO Quality Measures\nCaravan Health is concerned that the proposed reduction in the number of MSSP ACO quality measures is not\nfair to participants in ACOs and other APMs participating in MIPS. While standard MIPS-eligible clinicians may\nstill have the option of choosing measures on which they will score well, ACOs would be limited to the smaller\nset of measures in the proposed rule. This inappropriately raises the bar for ACOs, putting them at a\ndisadvantage compared to those outside of alternative payment models. \n\nFurther, including fewer prevention measures is a step in the wrong direction for care quality. While several of\nthese measures that CMS proposes retaining have implicit process measures pertaining to prevention, those\nmeasures are not as robust as the current set of measures. With these changes, clinicians and patients would\nlose data from measures such as tobacco use, flu vaccinations, fall risk, and cancer screenings that give a fuller\npicture of preventive care performance.", "216": "The proposed increase in the quality performance standard could allow ACOs to more clearly differentiate\nthemselves from non-ACO providers. However, these changes are not entirely clear. Will the threshold changes\nmean that the average of all measures must be at the 40th percentile, or must each individual measure meet this\nthreshold?", "217": "Caravan is concerned about removing the option for web interface reporting, as it increases burden for ACOs\nwho would have to adapt to a new system during a public health emergency. We also have concerns with the\nburden of switching from a small sample to large percentage of patients for quality reporting.", "218": "ACO Relief Due to PHE\nCaravan Health supports the option of allowing ACOs to use the higher of 2019 or 2020 ACO quality scores for\n2020. We also support awarding full credit for CAHPS reporting in 2020. However, CMS can and should go much\nfurther in alleviating the result of the public health emergency on accountable care organizations. As we have\ncommented to CMS before, we urge CMS to pay all ACOs for reporting quality in 2020 or move to a new system\nthat would compensate for more critical activities during the public health emergency. The circumstances of the\npandemic will make precise differentiation of quality in primary care practices near impossible. Using any 2020\nquality data for performance evaluation would undercut the legitimacy of the program and we recommend\nsuspending its use in establishing bonuses, penalties, and benchmarks at any point in the future.", "219": "We also support awarding full credit for CAHPS reporting in 2020.", "220": "Merit-Based Incentive Payment System\nAligning MIPS and ACO quality scoring is a step in the right direction, but this proposed rule does not achieve\nthis in an even-handed way. While ACOs and other APMs would be subject to a new APM performance pathway\nin 2021, the previously finalized MIPS Value Pathways would be delayed until a later time. The timeline for these\nchanges should be fully aligned.\nAll the providers making up an APM entity should share in accountability, rather than have the option for\nexcluding themselves from shared reporting. Providers reporting separately could fracture the foundation of an\naccountable care organization, add confusion, and negate the commitment to the ACO. Caravan Health is\nfurther concerned that separately reporting on quality could disproportionately affect rural and smaller\nproviders.", "221": "We support the proposal to reduce the total number of measures in the quality measure set from 23 to 6, which would reduce reporting burden for providers and enable greater focus on a small number of high-impact measures. For the following measure -- Risk Standardized, All-Cause Unplanned Admission for Multiple Chronic Conditions for ACOs -- we recommend that CMS provide quarterly reports to ACOs that not only indicate their ACO\u2019s performance on this measure, but also include a list of ACO members that qualified for the measure denominator (members identified by CMS as having multiple chronic conditions). This will allow ACOs to optimize their internal patient identification processes, driving more targeted improvement on this measure. For other measures on the MSSP quality measures slate, such as diabetes: HbA1c Poor Control, CMS provides ACOs with a registry of members that are part of the diabetes cohort. We recommend that CMS offer ACOs a similar registry for the Unplanned Admissions for Multiple Chronic Conditions measure, which also involves cohort logic. While we support the aforementioned aspects of the APP, we would suggest delaying implementation until 2022 or later. If the proposed rule is finalized, ACOs would have little time to digest the new regulations and, importantly, move to a new reporting process. Forcing ACOs into the APP in 2021 may have an inadvertent negative impact on quality if ACOs cannot adequately review and refine their quality reporting strategies.", "224": "In addition, there are a number of changes that are being proposed in how quality will be evaluated starting in 2021. In the current proposal, performance scoring needs to be at or above the 40th percentile in order to meet the quality performance standard. CMS has noted that many ACOs perform well in quality under the current standards and thereby, increasing the standards to which an ACO needs to achieve in order to be eligible to earn shared savings. In addition, currently the CAHPS for ACO questions are counted as 10 individual measures in the Patient/Caregiver experience domain and in the proposed rule the CAHPS for MIPS survey related questions will be counted just as one measure. CMS is also proposing to wait until the 2021 reporting is complete to release the 2021 benchmarks. Currently, an ACO needs to achieve the 30th percentile on at least one measure in each domain to meet the minimum quality standard and be eligible for shared savings. We believe this requirement is achievable since the benchmarks are released early enough during the performance year, helping an ACO set goals throughout the year. In addition, there are enough measures in each domain to allow ACOs to meet the 30th percentile in at least one measure per domain. We believe the proposal to increase the minimum threshold from the 30th to the 40th percentile sets too high of a bar, especially if the 2021 benchmarks are not being released until after the 2021 performance year and the number of measures is reduce to six for 2021. We ask CMS to revisit the 40th percentile proposal and keep this at the 30th percentile for 2021. In addition, we ask CMS to consider allowing some or all measures to be pay-forreporting for the 2021 performance year due to the current public health emergency. We would also ask that CMS continue to award improvement points for ACOs who are able to increase their performance from one year to the next in order to recognize the work the ACO has undertaken to improve their quality score.", "230": "Summary of key recommendations: MSSP Proposals \n\u2022 Do not finalize proposals to change the way ACOs are measured on and report quality measures. Instead, we urge CMS to work with NAACOS and other stakeholders to make changes to the current quality measure performance evaluation criteria and measure set for ACOs to further refine the measures and criteria as appropriate for a group of providers who are responsible for total cost of care for the populations they serve. \n\u2022 Do not reduce the number of clinical quality measures for ACOs to three measures. While CCPM supports reducing reporting burdens and efforts to eliminate low value measures, these proposals go too far by reducing the number of clinical quality measures to a mere three measures. CMS should work with stakeholders to identify the most appropriate set of measures for ACOs. \n\u2022 Do not discontinue the use of the Web Interface as a quality reporting mechanism for MSSP and MIPS. Instead, CMS should maintain the Web Interface as an option as they gradually include additional reporting options for ACOs in the future.\nDo not finalize proposals to score ACOs subject to MIPS under the APM Performance\nPathway (APP). Instead we urge CMS to maintain the MIPS APM Scoring Standard.", "231": "Summary of key recommendations: MSSP Proposals \n\u2022 Implement alternative policies such as reverting all quality measures to pay-for-reporting or providing ACOs with historical quality performance scores for the 2021 performance year, as CMS continues to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19.", "232": "Summary of key recommendations: MSSP Proposals \n\u2022 Update the definition of primary care codes used for MSSP assignment and ensure that patients are attributed to providers from whom they receive their primary care services.

CMS does not include any further details regarding how CMS would determine if the three required measures were not applicable to the ACO. Comments: CCHI opposes this approach to provide ACOs the option of selecting alternative quality measures to report. First, we cannot contemplate instances when the proposed APP measures listed would be determined to not apply to an ACO. Second, allowing this option would make program evaluation nearly impossible. Evaluating ACO\u2019s impact on quality should be a key focus for CMS and, therefore, there should be one standard set of quality measures that apply to all ACOs participating in the model. Finally, CCHI has concerns that this policy would allow certain organizations to select measures for which they have the highest historical performance, not allowing for a true and fair assessment of quality improvement efforts across ACOs.", "244": "Proposals: CMS clarifies that to align Track 1+ policies with MSSP policies, the agency is providing Track 1+ ACOs whose agreement periods are set to expire December 31, 2020, an opportunity to voluntarily extend their agreement period for a fourth performance year in 2021. Additionally, CMS clarifies that the proposed MSSP policies in this rule would apply to Track 1+ ACOs in the same way they apply to Track 1 ACOs as long as the applicable regulation has not been waived under the Track 1+ Model. Comments: We thank CMS for taking action to provide more flexibility to ACOs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We strongly support the option provided to ACOs with agreements ending December 31, 2020, to extend their agreements for an additional performance year and appreciate the agency clarifying that this policy also applies to Track 1+ ACOs. This will provide much needed stability for ACOs in an uncertain time.", "245": "CCHI supports updating the definition of primary care codes used for MSSP assignment. Assignment is a critical program methodology that determines the beneficiary population for which an ACO is held accountable. Adding codes such as \u201ce-visits,\u201d chronic care management, and principal care management will help create a better picture of where patients receive most of their primary care. CMS should continue to refine the primary care codes used in assignment, and we request that the agency do so in a timely manner. We recommend CMS finalize adding the nine proposed codes to the MSSP assignment methodology. CCHI also appreciates CMS\u2019s desire to ensure that patients are attributed to providers from whom they receive their primary care services. Therefore, we support excluding advance care planning services from MSSP assignment when billed in an inpatient setting and also excluding professional services furnished by FQHCs or RHCs when delivered in a SNF. Both of these changes, while technical in nature, help create more complete and accurate patient assignment lists for ACOs and we recommend the agency finalize these proposals. While CCHI appreciates CMS\u2019s work to refine assignment during the COVID-19 PHE, CCHI recommends that CMS use a two-year assignment window for MSSP to account for potential variations in attribution in 2020 and 2021. Especially in states hit harder by the pandemic, healthy patients may forego routine primary care and throw off assignment for MSSP ACOs who use either retrospective or prospective attribution. Therefore, patient visits from 2019 and 2020 should be considered for ACOs\u2019 assignment lists regardless if ACOs choose prospective attribution or retrospective attribution. While the windows for either groups of ACOs will be different, the same general principle applies and would help create more steady and accurate assignment lists. The Next Generation ACO Model uses a two-year assignment window already.", "246": "Quality Category: CMS Web Interface (CWI) Removal: We do not support removal of the CMS Web Interface collection and submission type in 2021 performance year/2023 payment year. We request the removal be postponed due to effects from the COVID19 pandemic and significant hardships. First, the COVID19 pandemic has significantly reduced revenue and forced furloughs and reduced the number of staff in organizations. The effects of and Page 4 of 9 recovery from the revenue reduction will continue over the next several years. Removal of CMS Web Interface will increase costs for organizations during this delicate time. A switch to MIPS CQMs and eCQMs in a short time period will require contracts with third party vendors at a significant cost to the organization. As opposed to CWI reporting, which was performed in-house without third party vendors and minimal additional cost to our organization. Second, as an academic medical system, our budgets are complete as our fiscal year is July to June. The cost increase was not included in the budget and may lead to higher reductions in revenue. The switch to other collection and submission types are very costly and not included in lean budgets. Third, the short timeframe to change collection and submission types will not allow for identification and implementation of changes to workflows. For instance, our current electronic medical record does not include billing information. For eCQMs, billing information is a vital component for accurate reporting of quality measures. For MIPS CQMs, data within the electronic medical record may be in locations beneficial to CWI reporting, but not for MIPS CQM reporting. Changes to locations of data require workflow changes for clinicians and other staff. If CWI is removed, it is improbable to make these changes in a few months. Fourth, personnel have been relocated to telehealth and other staff deployed home, thus there are less on-site resources for changes needed to implement a change to collection and submission types. Fifth, we will experience a drop in measure performance by the quick switch in collection types allowing for no opportunity for improvements in workflows and change in clinician documentation.

We strongly believe that the Web Interface reporting mechanism should still be considered an option to report quality in 2021 and onwards.

For the remainder of 2020, hospitals, group\npractices, and individual providers will be focused on urgent or emergent patients, as well as\nprotecting themselves, their staff, and other patients from the coronavirus. While CMS has\nexpanded telehealth coverage for Medicare ACOs, many quality measures cannot be properly\nmet in a remote setting (e.g., immunizations, mammography). Due to uncontrollable\ncircumstances, ACO quality performance should be measured on a Pay-For-Reporting basis\nfor PY2020. Please see the quality measure grid on last page for more detail.\nIf CMS does include any Pay-for Performance measures for PY 2020, then Steward\nrecommends that all 2020 MSSPs should receive for each measure the higher of the 2019\nmean quality score across all 2019 ACOs, the ACO\u2019s 2019 actual performance or the ACO\u2019s\nactual measure performance for performance year 2020. Using the same year (2020) national\nmean for quality measures will not have the intended effect of the Extreme and Uncontrollable\nCircumstances policy. By taking the 2019 national mean for measures in Domains 2, 3, and 4,\nit will significantly reduce the adverse impact of COVID-19 and mitigate the disproportional\nimpact different ACOs experience depending on the state(s) the majority of their ACO\nmembers reside in. For example, ACOs with a large rural population already have advanced\ntelehealth and remote patient monitoring capabilities and are better equipped to manage\npatients during a global pandemic. However, ACOs with patients predominantly located in\nurban service areas have lesser developed telehealth functionality.", "276": "PY 2021: CMS should not reduce the number of measures nor raise the minimum\npercentile requirements for ACOs to share in savings.\nWe recommend CMS leave the regulation as it is currently, where ACOs must completely and\naccurately report all measures and achieve at, or above, the 30th percentile on one measure in\neach domain to be eligible to share in savings.\nHolding providers accountable for a wide range of measures leads to broader quality\nimprovement for more patients with varying conditions. A significant cut to the number of\nmeasures could potentially lead to reduced efforts from providers, a spike in inpatient\nadmissions and utilization, and most importantly, an overall decrease in patient quality of care.\nAdditionally, CMS should not implement a performance floor during a transitional year:\nPerformance benchmarks will change to MIPS program benchmarks, which are calculated on\nhistorical MIPS data, from ACO program benchmarks. Based on the disruption that COVID-\n19 has caused to 2019 reporting, and is anticipated for 2020, CMS expects to release the\nbenchmarks retrospectively (after performance rates have been calculated). Because of this,\nthe proposed rule essentially requires ACOs to achieve the 40th percentile without knowing\nwhat that benchmark will be in advance of the performance period.By increasing the minimum quality thresholds from the 30th to 40th percentile for all measures,\nCMS is jeopardizing ACOs\u2019 ability to share in savings which directly threatens long-term\nsustainability of Medicare ACO programs going forward. Using the latest 2019 MSSP\npublicly available data, approximately 300 ACOs (55%) would have been ineligible to share in\nsavings if the proposed 40th percentile minimum threshold rule was in place during that time\nfor the proposed five measure set, excluding the CAHPS survey measure. Of those 300\nACOs, 148 earned shared savings in PY2019 totaling approximately $650 million in shared\nsavings that would have been forfeited. Medicare ACO programs can be very costly to\noperationalize, and with an increased chance of earning zero shared savings, this proposal has\nunintended consequences mainly leading to reduced ACO participation.", "277": "PY 2021: CMS should continue using the quality reporting web interface system and\nshould not switch to MIPS reporting.\nUnder the proposed rule, ACOs would have to use an entirely new data source to report\nperformance. Electronic EMR data would be submitted and the data would be all-payer data\nnot just the managed fee-for-service Medicare population. This proposal would put come at a\nsignificant cost, especially for ACOs who do not use a single EMR. ACOs would need more\ntime than the rule contemplates to determine whether the EMR functionality at each practice\nthroughout their network is robust enough to support all-payer performance for each provider.\nSteward has made significant investments in centralizing our Medicare ACO data and\nreporting in one consolidated Data Warehouse that supports coordination of care across the\ncontinuum of care. Centralization allows an ACO to integrate data from a wide array of data\nsources \u2013 including claims, clinical records, patient experience, community services, care\nmanagement and ancillary services \u2013 that can be used to match patients to ACO resources as\nwell as reduce waste and overutilization to achieve improved access, cost, and quality goals.\nThis centralization also supports complete and accurate reporting at the ACO-level.\nDecentralizing quality reporting to reflect the current APM EMR-level reporting will\nundermine the established infrastructure and result in underreporting of quality performance.\nLastly but importantly, this proposal would not leave ample time for ACOs to retain a vendor\nto complete this reporting, putting the ACO in jeopardy of earning savings regardless of actual\nquality and cost performance.", "280": "CMS has proposed a major overhaul of MSSP quality measurement reporting mechanisms,\ndecreased the number of quality measures to be reported and proposed a higher quality\nperformance standard.

In place of the Web Interface, the APP would require ACOs to actively report on three clinical quality measures, which could be reported using a registry or direct via electronic health records (EHRs) using electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) standards. These eCQMs must be reported for all patients, regardless of payer. Comments: CMS proposes to abruptly end the use of the Web Interface reporting mechanism, a tool that has been used since the MSSP's inception. Removing this option for all ACOs with little notice is ill-timed and unfair. We agree with NAACOS' views on moving to a registry or EHR-based reporting method. Moving to a registry or EHR-based reporting method will significantly increase the number of patients an ACO must report on and be evaluated on under CMS proposals. Currently, ACOs must report on 248 ACO patients included in the Web Interface. Under the registry option, an ACO would have to report on 60 percent of their patients, both Medicare and non-Medicare patients as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For the EHR reporting method, ACOs would be required to report on 70 percent of patients, both Medicare and non-Medicare as well as ACO and non-ACO patients. For some ACOs this could be a drastic increase and will therefore add significant administrative burden for the ACO. Should CMS finalize this approach, the agency should be requiring the ACO to report on, at a maximum, 50 percent of exclusively ACO patients. These specification issues and differences demonstrate why we feel an ACO-tailored approach to quality measurement and assessment is more appropriate than trying to make the MIPS program and standards apply to ACOs.", "286": "We are also pleased to see CMS remove the requirement for ACOs to field a CAHPS for ACOs survey in 2020 and provide full points automatically for each of the CAHPS survey measures.

Assignment is a critical program methodology that determines the beneficiary population for which an ACO is held accountable. Adding codes such as \"e-visits,\" chronic care management, and principal care management will help create a better picture of where patients receive most of their primary care.

This proposal is consistent with our June 2018 report to the Congress, in which the Commission formalized a set of principles for designing Medicare quality incentive programs. Our principles include that quality incentive programs should score a small measure set tied to clinical outcomes as well as patient experience. These measures should not be unduly burdensome for providers, and they should generally be calculated or administered by CMS, preferably with data that are already reported, such as claims, encounters, and patient survey data.

Scoring caps for\n\u201ctopped out\u201d measures would not apply, though those measures may be removed in future\nperformance years. Web Interface would be removed as a reporting option, so MSSP ACOs would select\none of the other available mechanisms to report quality data. Under the new APP, all MSSP ACOs would\nbe scored on six static quality measures (instead of 23) and actively report three measures (instead of\n10). The CAHPS for MIPS survey, which currently counts as 10 separate measures and comprises 25\npercent of the MSSP quality score, would count as one measure.\nACP Comments: In general, ACP appreciates the spirit of this proposal to streamline quality reporting\nand minimize burden on MSSP ACOs. We also support a number of the individual proposals. However,\nwe do have concerns with some proposals about several potential unintended consequences.\n\nMost acutely, we are concerned about the proposed implementation timeline, particularly given the\ndelayed release of the final rule and the COVID-19 PHE. ACP urges CMS to delay any proposed MSSP\nquality reporting changes until the 2022 performance year, particularly removing Web Interface as an\navailable reporting option. MSSP ACOs have been reporting via web interface since the program\u2019s start.\nMany may have limited familiarity with other reporting options. Moreover, many ACOs are complex\nnetworks of different practices, hospitals, and health systems. It will take time to evaluate alternative\noptions, sign a new vendor contract, and implement a coordinated roll out across all of these entities.\nLess than 60 days\u2019 notice is an insufficient window of time to implement these changes successfully,\nespecially during a global pandemic. Additionally, Web Interface requires reporting on a sample of the\nfirst 248 consecutively assigned patients. The majority of other reporting methods require reporting on\n60-70 percent of all eligible patients across payers, which would represent a massive increase in\nreporting burden, which again, comes at a particularly inopportune time with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis would mean ACOs would have to collect this data from each of its participating TINs, which would\nlikely entail transitioning them all to the same EHR, QCDR, or qualified registry platform \u2013 a potential\nlogistical nightmare with untold rippling effects on expense and reporting disruption that may force\npractices to re-evaluate their participation in the ACO. Removing the Web Interface reporting option\nand finalizing the other MSSP quality reporting changes within the proposed timeframe risks possible\nwide-scale quality reporting disruptions for MSSP ACOs.", "304": "We are also concerned about potential implications that evaluating MSSP ACOs on MIPS benchmarks\nwould have both for ACOs and other MIPS eligible clinicians, which is exacerbated by the fact that Web\nInterface would no longer be an available reporting option.

ACOs\nare large, sophisticated, and complex systems with unique attributes that distinguish them from\nindividual clinicians or group practices. Including them in benchmarks calculations for other MIPS\nreporting modalities may drastically alter benchmarks for other MIPS eligible clinicians and further\nexacerbate the performance gap between small practices and larger health systems. At the very least,\nfor a change of this magnitude, the Agency should provide more data, ideally modeling past\nperformance data that compares how benchmarks under the proposed new methodology would\ncompare to the current methodology, both for MSSP ACOs and general MIPS benchmarks.

Through patient\nattribution, responsibility for the quality and costs of the care delivered to that patient for a\nspecific performance period and under value-based contracts, the patient attribution process\ndefines a provider\u2019s risk pool, influences medical loss ratio, and determines whether a provider\nwill realize shared savings or losses and how those funds or penalties are allocated. As patients\nseek telehealth services from providers at their own convenience, the potential for care to be\ngiven to patients by providers who specialize exclusively in telehealth and do not have an\nongoing longitudinal relationship with a primary care physician is high. As a result, these\ntelehealth-only providers could possibly conduct services such as virtual annual wellness visits\nthat would not be properly attributed and disrupt the continuum of care and attribution data as\na result. It is important to ensure that patients are accurately assigned to their providers,\neven if the patient seeks care from other doctors.", "326": "- PeaceHealth agrees with the addition of APPs, but urge more consideration and definition around how ACOs fit into the framework.", "327": "Alternative Payment Model Performance Pathway (APP)\n\nEffective performance year 2021, CMS proposes to replace the current system of quality reporting and\napply the APP approach to MSSP ACOs.

In contrast, the remaining MIPS reporting options\navailable to ACOs, registry (CQM) and EHR (eCQM), evaluate data on all patients, regardless of\npayer, that meet measure denominator criteria. Therefore, eliminating the Web Interface option\nwould result in a significant change in how ACOs are evaluated on quality metrics, since the\nremaining options consider all patients, rather than a predefined set of patients. More time is needed\nto evaluate whether this is appropriate and, if so, for ACOs to understand the implications of this\nchange.\nAdditionally, this proposal raises operational questions and concerns. ACOs moving to CQM or\neCQM may encounter technical difficulties and data-sharing limitations that arise from lack of\ninteroperability. ACOs often consist of several group practice TINs that all work together to achieve\nthe goals of the ACO and the program. This entails coordination across multiple practice sites, which\nmay utilize several different EHRs, and in some cases, upwards of a dozen different systems. For an\nACO that uses multiple systems, the shift away from Web Interface to CQM or eCQM may require\nadditional capabilities to enable reporting, such as retention of a separate third-party vendor to\naggregate patient data across these systems or added functionalities to existing products. This\ninvolves not only added expenses but also learning and implementing new workflows. ACOs and\ntheir participant groups need time to make these changes and secure appropriate vendors and/or\nadded technological capabilities within their current systems.

The Cost category would be weighted at 0% and the Improvement Activities (IA) would automatically be assigned to the MIPS APM based on the requirements of the MIPS APM.

Our primary concern is the risk of unintended consequences because it does not adequately consider the competing risk of mortality. Providers with higher mortality rates for more severely ill patients could appear to be providing better quality care. Concerns have been raised in multiple peer reviewed publications about the possible association between incentives to reduce admission and increased mortality rates.24-28 It is also unclear whether hospital readmission rates truly reflect the quality of care for all patient populations and whether incentivizing lower readmissions could potentially exacerbate disparities in care. Admission rates may be modified by providing better quality care or they may be modified by simply increasing the threshold to admit patients who would benefit from admission. Thus, they may be measuring differences in admission thresholds or even unmeasured differences in social risk or disease severity and not quality of care. The AHA suggests that CMS consider a measure such as risk-adjusted home time which, if carefully designed, might better balance the competing risks of readmission and mortality and mitigate some of these concerns. Further, CMS may want to consider the additional recommendations for improving on readmission measures and reducing the risk of potential inequities and unintended consequences included in the recent paper by Psotka et al.28 The AHA absolutely supports a systems-level approach by clinicians to better coordinate care across providers and settings of care. However, we are not convinced that holding physician groups accountable for all unplanned readmissions is the best way to accomplish this.

The\nAcademy favors the proposal for ACOs that do not completely\nreport quality and those whose quality falls below the mean in\n2020, to assign the higher of an ACO\u2019s own 2019 or 2020\nquality performance scores as this provides the largest\nopportunity for struggling ACOs to share in savings.\n\no Of the options in this proposed rule, the Academy favors the\nproposal for ACOs that do not completely report quality and\nthose whose quality falls below the mean in 2020, to assign the\nhigher of an ACO\u2019s own 2019 or 2020 quality performance scores.", "424": "o The Academy strongly supports the elimination of CAHPS\nrequirements and automatic full credit on CAHPS measures for\n2020.", "428": "Although we understand the desire to streamline the myriad of programs, given the current turmoil in the Healthcare system the proposed rule has too many drastic changes to be accomplished effectively.\nRequiring ACOs to achieve the 40th percentile for all Quality Measures in order to receive Shared Savings that are earned is a drastic change from the current requirement of having to score at or above the 30th percentile on only one measure in each of the four domains. With CAHPS data currently only supplied at the ACO level, and not at the individual ACO participant TIN level, it has been nearly impossible to influence performance in this area as we cannot provide accurate feedback to each participant TIN. Additionally, our providers are unable to focus on most preventative measures as they are focused on handling the current pandemic.", "429": "Removing the CMS Web-Interface, which is the reporting mechanism we have utilized for years, will present significant challenges in reporting quality. We will have to find a way to aggregate data across a plethora of EMRs with little notice and most likely with significant costs. Requiring ACOs to use the \u201cAPP\u201d methods for reporting quality, (Qualified Registry for example) requires reporting on a much larger sample size. Trying to aggregate data for the ACO sample size of 2,500 patients was a challenge, having to do it for 50,000 patients across multiple EMRs will be costly and time consuming. Any change to the reporting process after such an upheaval of the healthcare system, would not be advisable and may be better suited for 2022.\n\nTrying to force ACO\u2019s to \u201cfit\u201d into the \u201cQuality Payment Program\u201d (QPP) has caused confusion and frustration for our providers. The QPP does not have Help Desk staff that understand MSSP ACOs. We spend more time than we would like explaining to the help desk what we are and that we have different rules than most MIPS/Advanced APM participants.\n\nAllowing TINs and/or NPIs to report data on their own, outside of the ACO will cause even more confusion. Our Participant Practices will think they do not have to report on the same measures that the ACO is required to report on under the MSSP program. We have already encountered this issue in the past and when the providers contact the QPP Help Desk for clarification they are often given incorrect information as the QPP Help Desk staff does not understand the reporting requirements for MSSP ACOs.\n\nRequiring ACO Participants to submit the Promoting Interoperability category of MIPS is a drastic change for ACOs that took on risk and became Advanced APMs under MIPS. For 2020 if the ACO meets a \u201cthreshold\u201d our participants do not have to report this category under MIPS. This was one of the benefits to taking on risk to become an \u201cAdvanced Alternative Payment Model\u201d and removing this key benefit at a time with so much other upheaval in healthcare is an overwhelming burden for providers. Providers are required to utilize CEHRT under the MSSP program; placing additional reporting obligations takes up significant amounts of time that these providers should be spending on patient care.", "430": "Comments for CMS-1734-P III. G. (1)(b)(1) APM Performance Pathway for Shared Savings Program ACOs III. G (2)(b)(4)(1)(c) Groups and Virtual Groups Reporting via the CMS Web Interface We are in support of the reduction in quality measures (Table 36) from 23 to 6, with three being submitted annually. However, we have some doubts about the replacement of Web Interface as a submission method. As an Advanced APM, our ACO is only obligated to file quality through the MSSP data abstraction process. As such, our practices do not file MIPS and have not been set up to file MIPS; therefore, some of the assumptions you could make for a MIPS practice or an ACO-MIPS practice may not be valid in an AAPM practice. Our ACO, like many others, is a combination of employed clinicians and contracted clinicians. Although our employed clinicians are on a single CEHRT, our contracted clinicians are smaller practices and using many different types of CEHRT which is not fed into our system. While we appreciate the efforts that CMS is making to align the measures and make filing easier, our assessment indicates that we would not be able to take advantage of this proposed APP process of using eCQM or MIPS CQM because of the variations in CEHRT. We believe that, if CMS were to remove the current Web Interface process, we would still have to perform data abstraction to collect the data. It is not clear to us how we could then aggregate that information to submit through this new system without significant programming changes. As a solution, we would appreciate having the option to remain on Web Interface; or we would be open to a CMS solution that would allow ACO with different CEHRTs a pathway to APP.", "431": "Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) and the APM Performance Pathway (APP) Reporting Option\n\nWe note the CMS proposal to reduce the number of quality measures in the MSSP from 23 to six.\nAlthough we generally favor proposals that involve streamlining, reducing burden, or reducing\ncomplexity, it is not clear that this specific action will be good for beneficiaries. Presumably, focusing the\nentire quality measure set of ACOs on six specific measures would be based on a solid body of research \nwork showing that these measures have some special kind of \u201csentinel\u201d or \u201cleading indicator\u201d status\nsuch that good performance on these measures reflect a broader underlying quality factor that would\nshow up in higher scores on a large number of other measures. Or, the choice would be based on a body\nof science showing that these six measures, above all others, reflect the quality dimensions with the\ngreatest significance to overall population health as assessed by broad measures of life expectancy,\nfunctional status, or general wellbeing. None of that appears here. Although each measure has some\nscientific merit as a quality of care measure, none are supported by any solid evidence for some kind of\nunique standing as a \u201csentinel\u201d quality measure, and those that involve outcomes (perhaps five of the\nsix, depending on nuances of definition) require careful attention to risk adjustment before they can be\nclearly and fairly interpreted as quality of care measures. Per points made above about social risk\nadjustment, we believe that none of the outcome measures at the moment have adequate risk\nadjustment in order to be used in a way that fairly compares ACOs on the quality of care they provide.\n\nTherefore, we do not support this movement to just six quality measures, unless CMS can bring forward\nevidence of the unique standing of these measures as \u201csentinel\u201d quality measures of high significance,\nand unless CMS can enhance the risk adjustment models used in these measures to assure that ACOs\nserving either clinically or socially high-risk patient populations are fairly evaluated.", "460": "Additionally, CHPA opposes the overall approach proposed for ACO quality scoring. With upcoming changes to MIPS through the MIPS Value Pathways and exemptions due to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as for COVID-19, the 40th percentile of the Quality Category score could vary greatly from year to year making it a less meaningful indicator of true performance. Instead, should CMS move forward with proposals to re-design the quality assessment structure for ACOs, we urge CMS to utilize a 7 scoring approach that is more similar to the current domain-based scoring approach instead of using an all-or-nothing approach as proposed. As an example, CMS could instead consider a policy that would use a minimum attainment standard that requires 50 percent of the quality measures to meet or exceed the 40th percentile. This must be done in conjunction with our recommendations to add additional clinical quality measures to the measure set beyond the three that CMS has currently proposed. Setting the standard at 50 percent ensures that ACOs perform well on a substantial set of measures to earn savings but does not punish ACOs that miss the mark on a measure that is either not as relevant to their patient population or has a very narrow range of performance rates. Finally, CHPA also urges CMS to better reward high quality performers, as is done in the Medicare Advantage program by providing bonuses or higher shared savings rates to high quality performers or those that notably improve quality scores over time.", "466": "Under the Pathways to Success regulations when a recalculated repayment mechanism increases by a certain amount (i.e., the lesser of 50 percent or $1,000,000), CMS requires the ACO to increase the value of the repayment mechanism. However, CMS does not currently decrease the repayment mechanism amount when the opposite occurs, a policy for which CHPA has advocated and which the agency proposes to change in this rule. We appreciate CMS\u2019s proposal to allow ACOs an option to decrease their repayment mechanism amount if the recalculated amount is less than the current amount, and we request the agency finalize this policy. We also support CMS providing an opportunity for ACOs that renewed their agreements effective in 2019 or 2020 an opportunity to benefit from this policy change, if finalized, by adjusting their repayment mechanism amounts already in place, if they quality under the revised policy.", "478": "As the accountable care organization (ACO) that brought this concern to CMS, Community Health Center Network of Idaho (CHCNI) fully supports the CMS proposal to revise the existing exclusion for professional services billed under CPT codes 99304 through 99318 that are furnished in a SNF to include services reported on an FQHC or RHC claim that includes those CPT codes, when those services are furnished in a SNF. We further support the proposal that this revision would also be applicable to determining ACO beneficiary assignment for the performance year starting on January 1, 2021, and subsequent performance years. CHCNI is comprised solely of federally-qualified health centers (FQHC). The mission of all FQHCs is to provide quality care to anyone, regardless of their ability to pay. The FQHC mission makes the prospect of risk sharing a daunting one, but also in alignment with our commitment to our patients. The Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) provides an opportunity for healthcare networks like ours to build infrastructure to prepare to participate in risk sharing in value-based contracts. However, the current program exclusion regarding SNF claims meant to ensure that ACOs are being accurately and fairly held accountable for the care of their Medicare beneficiaries does not apply to FQHCs due to the their claim submission processes which are different than that of all other primary care providers. Since FQHCs do not use place of service codes or other indicators that a claim is eligible for exclusion, their claims are always considered primary care claims, even for SNF visits. These claims are then used for ACO beneficiary attribution and shared savings methodology, putting FQHC ACOs at an extreme disadvantage. CHCNI agrees with CMS's belief that it is important to exclude claims for FQHC and RHC services that include CPT codes 99304 through 99318 from use in assignment when there is a SNF facility claim with a date of service that overlaps with the date of FQHC or RHC services. Consistent with the previously established exclusion for claims billed under these codes when the services are provided to beneficiaries with an overlapping SNF stay, we believe it is important to exclude the same services from use in assignment when they are furnished by physicians and NPPs billing through an FQHC or RHC to beneficiaries in a SNF. CHCNI fully supports the proposed rule that would ensure parity between all ACOs participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program", "479": "[SPECIFICALLY MENTIONS QPP BUT COULD BE SSP AS WELL] Additionally, we are pleased that telehealth is further integrated into reporting and beneficiary assignment requirements in the Quality Payment Program. Telehealth will be particularly effective in value-based care arrangements as it can produce better outcomes at lower costs. While this rule focuses on fee-for-service Medicare, the ATA looks forward to continuing to work with CMS on transforming our system from one that rewards volume to one that rewards value, and we believe telehealth is an integral part of that effort.", "481": "2. If the Web Interface System is discontinued, delay the implementation of the proposed\nchanges to ACO Quality reporting until 2022\n\nOur first preference would be to continue allowing ACOs to report quality through the Web Interface\nSystem for the reasons described above.\n\nIf CMS chooses to discontinue Web Interface, we believe the timeline CMS has proposed to shift quality\nreporting to an eCQM based methodology is too aggressive and cannot be reasonably met by organizations\nnot already using eCQMs in an advanced manner.\n\nEven the most sophisticated TINs participating with POM ACO today have not built the programming\nnecessary in their EMRs to successfully report eCQM data to CMS nor to share it with POM ACO. Our\nsmallest and least resourced TINs may not even be reporting any eCQM data to CMS and may be\ncompletely at the mercy of their EMR vendor to make the programming changes necessary to be able to\nsubmit the required data to CMS and/or to POM ACO.\n\nFor every TIN, the amount of time, energy and money necessary to modify its EMR programming to meet\nthese proposed requirements will be different. By the time the proposed rule would be finalized, TINs and\nEMR vendors would be far behind the timelines necessary to complete, test, and validate the programming\nnecessary to successfully and confidently submit the necessary data to CMS or to their ACOs.", "482": "3. Allow ACO-Participating TINs to individually submit all necessary data for all components\nof the Alternative Payment Model Performance Pathway (APP) and create an ACO-wide\nscore rather than require ACOs to aggregate data and report on behalf of all participating\nTINs\n\nThroughout the proposed rule, CMS seems to draw a distinction between reporting done by ACOs and\nreporting done by ACO participants and ACO providers. This leads us to conclude that CMS expects\nACOs to be aggregating data for reporting that has not typically been the responsibility of ACOs and, as\nwe have described for Quality reporting above, may not always be possible or practical.\n\nWhile we strongly support CMS aligning reporting requirements for payment programs, we do not support\nplacing that reporting burden on ACOs. ACOs are often multi-TIN groups with disparate EMRs and\nwidely variable capabilities. There is no clear benefit to the MSSP\u2019s goals, or to patients, for ACOs to be\naggregating this data for submission to CMS. ACO\u2019s resources are better spent on improving care, care\ncoordination, and quality throughout their networks. These proposed data aggregation requirements do\nnot support those efforts. On the contrary, the proposed requirements would hinder ACO\u2019s care and\nquality improvement efforts by diverting scarce resources in order to meet reporting requirements.\n\nCMS is aggregating this data already, and could continue to aggregate the reporting done by ACOparticipating TINs in order to create ACO-wide scores for each MIPS category. Forcing ACOs to do this\ndata aggregation is duplicative and costly.", "486": "The AAN urges CMS to carefully consider policies that can aid small and solo practices in being\nsuccessful in the QPP, both during and after the PHE. CMS should also consider whether\nmodifications to the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy are necessary\nregardless of practice size, if the impacts of the PHE extend into 2021.", "500": "We thank CMS for taking action to provide more flexibility to ACOs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We strongly support the option provided to ACOs with agreements ending December 31, 2020, to extend their agreements for an additional performance year and appreciate the agency clarifying that this policy also applies to Track 1+ ACOs. This will provide much needed stability for ACOs in an uncertain time.", "509": "We do not support CMS proposal to change the policy to give ACOs that report the higher of their own score or the 40th percentile Quality Performance Category score of all MIPS reporters or to give ACOs that do not report the 40th percentile score. We believe CMS should maintain the existing policy of using the mean ACO score in place of the 40th percentile score. ACOs have typically outperformed many other MIPS reporters and using the 40th percentile score for those ACOs that are affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance is likely to give ACOs a much lower score than they might have earned outside of those unique circumstances.", "510": "[Not directly on this topic, but we thought it was important for DAFDA to review. We can recategorize if needed.]\nWe urge CMS to exclude MIPS bonuses as ACO expenditures under the MSSP shared savings and losses methodology. When ACO-attributed patients receive services from providers that have earned positive MIPS adjustments, it decreases the ACO\u2019s ability to generate savings. The effect of the current policy will become increasingly significant over time as MIPS adjustments rise in future program years. The current CMS policy creates misalignment between the goals of MIPS and MSSP. The better an ACO and its eligible clinicians perform in MIPS, the more challenging it will become to earn shared savings under MSSP. We strongly encourage CMS to amend the current methodology to exclude these payment adjustments.", "511": "We support CMS\u2019 proposed change to not require ACOs to administer the CAHPS for ACOs Survey for PY 2020 and to give all ACOs automatic full credit on all CAHPS measures. Should the COVID-19 pandemic extend for a significant portion of 2021, we recommend that CMS consider applying this change to PY 2021 as well.", "512": "We strongly support the alternative modification that CMS is considering to give ACOs that report quality for PY 2020, the higher of their PY 2019 or PY 2020 quality score. We believe this approach will encourage ACOs to report quality and do what they can to improve quality performance scores while also acknowledging the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and its likely effect on quality of care for reasons that are largely outside of an ACO\u2019s ability to control. We recommend CMS consider extending this approach to PY 2021 as well (i.e., that ACOs receive the higher of their PY 2021 or PY 2019 score).", "515": "We do not support CMS\u2019 proposal that ACOs that meet the quality performance standard would earn the maximum amount of shared savings. We believe there is value in encouraging improvement on quality measures beyond the minimum and that ACOs that perform better on quality should be rewarded with a higher savings percentage. We recommend that CMS keep the existing policy for incorporating quality performance into earned shared savings calculations", "517": "To date, CMS has not discussed digital health tools\u2019 key role in the success of APMs\nwhich should have the flexibility to use connected health technologies for patients with\nspecific at-risk chronic conditions. For example, the Medicare Shared Savings Program,\nby far Medicare\u2019s largest APM, CMS only waives patient location and geographic\nlimitations on accountable care organizations (ACOs) that are at financial risk and use\nprospective assignment. There also haven\u2019t been case studies on ACOs\u2019 use of RPM.\nIn order to help providers utilizing APMs meet statutory requirements to reduce total\ncosts, CMS should exercise its statutory authority under 42 U.S.C. 1315a(d)(1) (in the\ncase of CMMI Models) and 42 U.S.C. 1395jjj(f) (in the case of the Medicare Shared\nSavings Program) to waive payment and program requirements as appropriate.\nSpecifically, CMS should allow wider use of telehealth in the Shared Savings Program\nby allowing all ACOs access to telehealth waivers and expand what telehealth waivers\ncover, for example, to include patient cost-sharing, modalities, and covered services.", "530": "In addition, the ACC requests more clarity on quality reporting for the Next Generation ACO program\nwhich relies on the CMS web interface. CMS has extended this model for one additional year; the\nproposed rule does not indicate whether Next Generation ACO participants would have to transition to\na new reporting method for the final year of the program or if they will be permitted to use the web\ninterface for one additional year.

Examples include screening for isolation and for anxiety (similar to what we do for depression currently). In addition, there need to be more relevant behavioral health measures overall.", "534": "CMS needs to continue to pay for Telehealth for a multitude of reasons foremost being improved access to care. Telehealth allows patients to be seen when patients are unwilling or unable to get to the physicians office. Patients often cancel due to transportation or weather concerns prior to COVID restrictions. Now many patients are afraid to leave their house and foregoing routine following care and at times acute care needs. Telehealth visits also help with follow-up care. I can easily see my patients for simple routine care such as diabetes f/u or depression f/u via Telehealth. This increases compliance with f/u and with better adherence to medication regimens by allowing more frequent discussion between patients and providers. I implore you to continue payments for this service."}
