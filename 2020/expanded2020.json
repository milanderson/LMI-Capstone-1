"acupuncture is not dry needling and our training is 4 years of post-graduate training, as opposed to the weekend courses that practitioners of dry needling must participate in. we treat the entire body, as opposed to just the part that hurts, as this is what acupuncture is. we are holistic practitioners and would never be able to practice if we did not treat the whole body. nor would we be able to treat our patients at the reimbursement levels proposed. we would not be able to participate in medicare if this proposal goes through. essentially, this proposed rate is stating that acupuncture is not a covered service under medicare and is an insult to the acupuncture community as well as patients would wish to use medicare to cover acupuncture.", "26170": "to whom it may concern.    while i applaud the initiative to include acupuncture medicine for medicare patients, i strongly urge you to reconsider the proposed changes to the 2021 physician fee schedule (pfs) where they will reduce the relative value units (rvus) for acupuncture codes (97810-97814) and decrease the pfs conversion factor by 10%.    i treat many patients for chronic pain and other ailments, and see consistent lasting success to improve their long term health. these proposed changes would prevent too many patients from getting the proper care they need. with these proposed fees, patients could not be given effective care, as acupuncturists would be forced to either reject medicare patients or give less than adequate care, in order to survive financially. if these proposed changes are allowed, it would be difficult for myself and other acupuncturists to justify being a medicare and medicaid provider.    the proposed changes devalue acupuncture treatments to the point where it may not be financially feasible for licensed acupuncturists to serve medicare beneficiaries and other insurance patients. for example, when the vaccn program recently adopted medicare reimbursement rates, many licensed acupuncturists stopped accepting vaccn patients because the medicare rates did not provide a sustainable fee structure. we are concerned that this fee reduction will decrease patients ability to access care.    the expertise, skill and intensity required for codes 97810-97814 is distinct from codes 20560-20561 and they should not be cross walked. furthermore, the procedures themselves are nowhere similar. the precision and decision making involved in acupuncture is far beyond that of dry needling. this is why the ama established two distinct cpt codes for acupuncture and dry needling/trigger point acupuncture procedures. one significant difference is that the acupuncture codes include pre- and post-service work up (as per the ama cpt instructions) whereas the dry needling/trigger point acupuncture codes do not. another difference is the intensity of diagnostics. acupuncture point selection typically requires at least 5 to 10 points placed bilaterally in multiple body regions, and is considerably more involved than straightforward dry needling/trigger point acupuncture. these differences distinguish the skill and intensity of acupuncture versus dry needling/trigger point acupuncture.    these changes could go beyond medicare to all insured patients as private insurance often follows the the lead of medicare fee structures. this would further restrict access to patients. there would be a severe negative impact to millions of patients, and thousands of medical providers, if these changes to these codes go forward.    this would be unfortunate timing as the value of acupuncture for pain to reduce the reliance on opioids is well established. including this bulletin from the center for medicare and medicaid: https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/cib022219.pdf such changes would likely reduce the potential for acupuncture be a meaningful option for all chronic pain patients and their md's who seek alternatives to opioids.    for the sake of the well-being of my patients, i respectfully recommend that the rvus for acupuncture codes are not reduced from their current values.

chair in anesthesiology, director of the evidence- based pain medicine research at the cleveland clinic, and professor of anesthesiology at the cleveland clinic lerner college of medicine. i am also a practicing pain management physician at the cleveland clinic in the pain management department in cleveland, ohio, treating patients with lumbar degenerative disc disease for over 30 years.   i want to offer a new non-surgical intervention, intended to treat lumbar degenerative intervertebral discs to my patients with symptomatic degenerative disc disease, who have not responded to conservative treatments and are not appropriate for surgical lumbar fusion.   today, the typical treatment pattern for these patients refractory to conservative care can range from the continuation of traditional care, opioid analgesics, series of injections and nerve blocks, and lumbar fusion or disc replacement surgeries. unfortunately, none of the above modalities have proven effective in treating this intractable chronic pain condition.  however, there is a new regenerative minimally invasive option with proven durability and safety. such procedure involves injecting stem cells into the degenerative disc to allow restoration of the disc structure.   through the proposed rule, the procedure would be reported using new cpt codes 0627t and 0629t, beginning in january 2021. cms proposed that in 2021, hopps payment will be assigned to these codes, which is a level 3 nerve injection apc 5443.   my colleagues and | disagree with this payment assignment for several reasons:   1. this procedure is not a simple nerve injection. it is the percutaneous placement of an  allogeneic cellular and tissue-based biologics to supplement and support deteriorating intervertebral discs in patients suffering from symptomatic degenerative disc disease. therefore, these new cpt codes do not belong to the symptomatic nerve injections grouping from a clinical perspective.   2. many medicare patients have not responded to conventional treatments and are not  appropriate for surgical interventions. this one-time procedure has made a tremendous difference in addressing their degenerative disc disease and providing a reduction in pain and improvement in function.   3. suppose the economics of this procedure does not make it available to my patients,  who can benefit. in that case, these patients will continue to suffer and increase healthcare resources that do not address or resolve the condition such as chronic opioid use, costly radiofrequency ablation procedure, or lumbar fusion surgery, which in most cases, has complications.   the reference code cpt 22513 (percutaneous vertebral augmentation), is assigned to apc 5114. this is a reasonable estimate for the non-device cost of cpt codes 0627t and 0629t.  the total estimated cost to cpt codes 0627t and 0629t is the device cost of the via disc mixing system kit ($8,000) plus the non-device cost. this procedure should be assigned to a more appropriate apc to cover the procedure's non-device and device costs.   we urge cms to reconsider this apc assignment to provide this treatment option to our patients.

reductions must be made to others. however, the proposed 9% decrease to therapy services would be highly detrimental to the profession of occupational therapy, especially coupled with the other reimbursement cuts that therapy services have taken in recent years, and will continue to take with the ota payment reduction, which is effective in 2022.the cumulative nature of mppr, sequestration, and the ota payment modifier is already substantial and hard felt, particularly by practitioners in rural and underserved areas. as a result, occupational therapy private practices and outpatient clinics may need to reduce operations or close their small businesses altogether. moreover, the aging population is in greater need of occupational therapy practitioners than ever before. access to these services is essential for medicare beneficiaries who wish to age in place, particularly for the growing demographic with chronic conditions, but a single reimbursement cut of this magnitude may make practicing unsustainable for the profession.for example, these cuts would significantly impact the patient i serve secondary to socioeconomic status and limited access to healthcare; especially specialized healthcare such as cht.while the work relative value unit (rvu) increases to therapy evaluation and re-evaluation codes is appreciated, the increased value does not adequately off set the cuts to therapy intervention services. therapy services all require management of the whole patient, including medically complex patients with multiple medical conditions. therapy progress reports, which are required every 10 visits, involve the same assessment skills as a re-evaluation. the medicare benefit policy manual chapter 15, section 220.3.d states that progress reports shall include assessment of improvement, plans for continuing treatment, additional evaluation results, and treatment goals. all of these elements make progress reports analogous to evaluation and management services. because progress reports are not billable by their own cpt code, they are performed and included on days that therapy interventions are performed. therefore, we respectfully request that the mostly commonly billed therapy interventions, 97530 and 97110, be granted rvu increases to reflect the assessment- and management-focused components required to complete the progress report, since these components are analogous in many respects to the ot evaluation and re-evaluation codes.other services provided by occupational therapists that have a clearly established assessment and management component and therefore should be considered for additional reimbursement through rvu increases in the cy 2021 mpfs final rule include:97542\twheelchair management (e.g., assessment,

the consideration cms gave to occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech-language pathology practitioners to perform telehealth for the duration of the covid-19 public health emergency (phe), i have concerns about my patients ongoing therapy and rehabilitation issues after the phe ends and the waivers are revoked or expire. i ask that cms consider longer waiver coverage while the agency considers lifting the phe. until there is a vaccine, covid-19 will continue to be present in our communities and health care facilities. further, data currently indicates that the united states is likely to experience a second wave in the winter that could be followed by a third wave before a vaccine is developed. it is imperative for cms to maintain all health regulatory protections for as long as possible for the safety of the vulnerable beneficiary population and to assure efficient access to timely health care services. one of those critical protections for outpatient practices and institutional settings is the extension of telehealth. i urge cms to extend the therapy services telehealth waiver flexibility beyond the phe so that beneficiaries are not left suddenly without viable and safe rehabilitation treatment options. the additional time will also allow congress to assess the data from the phe and make decisions on the permanence of telehealth for therapy professionals. in addition, a longer term extension will assure patients who have successfully been accessing ot, pt, and/or slp via telehealth during the duration of the phe that they will not suddenly be discontinued from an effective and safe modality of treatment. such a sudden discontinuance of telehealth could result in medicare patients experiencing further functional decline, potentially leading to hospitalizations or re-hospitalizations.add therapy services to the telehealth services listi understand that cms is concerned about the confusion adding therapy services to the medicare telehealth list could cause because therapists are not medicare-eligible telehealth providers outside of the phe. however, the experiences of the phe have demonstrated that therapists can effectively and efficiently provide services using audio visual technology. our associations will continue to advocate with congress to legislatively add therapists as telehealth providers. when those efforts succeed, it would be counterproductive to have to wait for the next cms rule making cycle to get the codes added in order to perform telehealth services. adding therapy services as category iii codes will allow cms and congress the necessary time to analyze the phe data, which will undoubtedly show positive outcomes and increased beneficiary access to therapy, especially in rural areas.adding the above listed cpt codes to the category iii list, in combination with extending waiver flexibilities to allow therapists to perform telehealth beyond the phe, is the best solution to ensure the best

ncd 190.3 (cytogenetics studies). while the coalition understands the rationale for removal, we support comments from other key laboratory and pathology stakeholders indicating that these ncds are still appropriate to maintain. if cms does remove these ncds, we request that cms monitor closely local contractor activity to ensure there is no disruption in access.d. request to address the 10.61%

negative 10.61 percent from the 2020 rbrvs cf of $36.0896. our coalition has grave concerns about the magnitude of the cuts to payments. we recognize the limited authority cms has to modify statutorily mandated budget neutrality adjustment when calculating updates to the conversion factor. however, we are alarmed at the potential cascading impacts on both physician practices and clinical patient outcomes. resolution of this issue will require action by congress and others outside of cms. our coalition strongly urges cms to coordinate with these entities as it relates to updates to the fee schedule and processing claims.", "16732_1": " the magnitude of the proposed cuts to the rbrvs cfs is significant and has the potential to have a devastating impact on physician practices while the country continues to struggle with the covid-19 pandemic. the proposed rbrvs cf of $32.2605 is $4 less than the rbrvs cf in 1998 of $36.6873, the first year that cms established a single rbrvs cf. for all of these reasons, cms must address the negative impact of this proposed cut. the covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on all aspects of life in the united states and across the globe. healthcare providers have played a critical role in meeting the challenges of providing care to covid-19 patients and maintaining access to care for all other patients. the pandemic has also created historic financial pressures on large and small practices and health systems across the country. beyond the financial pressure, providers have had to develop new ways of providing care to reduce exposure to the virus for patients and providers. as practices across the country are in the midst of a financial crisis an additional almost 11% payment cut on top of the revenue reductions they have already been experiencing will put practices and patient access to care at risk. data indicates that physician practices across the country have reported steep declines in revenues. patient volume has dropped either because patients are avoiding all non-emergency care or social distancing rules results in reduced capacity to see the same volume of patients. a recent survey from the centers for disease control and prevention found that more than 40% of us adults said they delayed or avoided medical treatment during the pandemic. while telehealth has been helpful for many practices to continue to see patients, it is not an option for all. even those practices who have increased their utilization of telehealth services, are still experiencing significant revenue declines. there is some indication that physicians who are closer to retirement may be forced into early retirement with an inadequate replacement physician workforce, which will only exacerbate patient access to care issues. our coalition is also concerned that these payment cuts, if finalized, will undermine the government's significant efforts to support healthcare practices during the pandemic. we thank the administration and congress for recognizing the financial stress of the covid-19 pandemic on physicians and practices and for allocating resources to critical relief efforts such as the provider relief fund, the advanced payment program, the accelerated payment program, the paycheck protection program and small business administration loans. these efforts along with the various waivers and flexibilities implemented during the phe have provided critical support to physicians and hospitals. while these programs have aided the u.s. healthcare system during this crisis, we fear that this proposed pfs payment cut will derail and undo all of that great work. the covid-19 pandemic has caused unexpected and significant economic challenges that threaten the viability of medical practices throughout the country. we ask cms to take measures to protect our nations medical providers and the patients we serve.e. request to revise utilization assumption for new add-on code gpc1x dm_hc 1317522-1.093633.0611 administrator verma cms-1734-p october 2, 2020 page 4 cms utilization assumptions for new add-on code gpc1x contributes significantly to the increase in spending that is driving the 10.61% budget neutrality adjustment. our coalition does not believe these estimates are reasonable and urges cms to review and reduce its utilization assumptions for gpc1x. the 10.61% reduction in the medicare rbrvs cf is the result of an estimated additional$10.2 billion in proposed spending of which $3.3 billion is estimated to come from the reporting of gpc1x. in the cy 2020 pfs final rule cms estimated that the 21 specialties that bill e/m codes would bill code gpc1x with 100% of their office/outpatient visits. the coalition has significant concerns with this utilization assumption. we find it highly unlikely that all 21 specialties would furnish that level of complex physician work for every patient coming in for an e/m visit. additionally, gpc1x will be a new code in 2021 and one that is unlike any other on the physician fee schedule. it always takes a period of time before clinicians start reporting new codes. with the confusion around the appropriate reporting of this code, it may take even longer than usual. cms should reconsider and reduce their utilization assumptions for this code to better reflect the more likely reporting scenarios. because of the dramatic impact this utilization assumption will have on the entire fee schedule, it is critical that it is grounded in valid and reasonable data. a near 11% reduction in the rbrvs will be devastating to patients and providers. cms must actively pursue ways to mitigate the negative impact of this situation. we believe evidence supports a reduction in the utilization assumptions. through the years, cms has found ways within their authority to reduce the negative impact of policies on patients and clinicians. we strongly urge you to once again do the same now.", "16732_2": " kkrkkekk we appreciate your

physician fee schedule dear administrator verma: the medical imaging technology alliance (mita) is writing in support of the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) proposal in the cy 2021 physician fee schedule (pfs) proposed rule to retire section 220.6.16 of the national coverage determinations (ncd) manual, fdg pet for inflammation and infection, and allow coverage at the discretion of the medicare administrative contractors (macs). as outlined below, we believe the clinical evidence supports mac coverage of these indications, along with mac discretion to cover other fda approved positron emission tomography (pet) imaging agents that are not subject to an existing ncd. as discussed below, in order to retire this ncd, cms will also need to revise the preamble language in section 220.6 of the manual, which presently nationally prohibits coverage of pet for indications that are not expressly covered in section 220.6. without such a change, macs would not be able to cover fdg pet for infection and inflammation or other fda- approved non-oncologic imaging indications without a specific ncd. this modernization of the twenty-year-old pet coverage policies is supported by the trump administrations october 2019 executive order, to streamline the approval, coverage, and coding process so that innovative products are brought to market faster. additionally, we recommend that cms update its criteria for expedited retirement of ncds to allow for the retirement of ncds that more than five years old, or for which there is new clinical evidence or fda authorization that causes the ncd to be outdated or to restrict ' executive order on protecting and improving medicare for our nations seniors, oct. 3, 2019, available at https://www.whitel id tive-order-protecti nations-seniors/. 1 beneficiary access to medically necessary items and services. this will provide cms with much-needed flexibility given the fast pace of health care innovation in this space. the medical imaging & technology alliance (mita) represents companies whose sales comprise more than 90 percent of the global market for medical imaging technology. the pet group within mita is a collective voice of pet and spect radiopharmaceutical developers, manufacturers and distributors. advances in nuclear medicine allow clinicians to more effectively identify and target disease thereby providing more options for treatment resulting in better patient outcomes. advances have been made in cancer, heart disease, alzheimers pathology and in other areas. in some cases, there are no alternative diagnostics.i. background on cms coverage of pet cms has reviewed medicare coverage for pet more than any other technology dating back to the 1990s. the nineteen national coverage analyses (ncas) performed by cms during this time period have included review of multiple imaging agents, including fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg), beta amyloid, sodium fluoride-18 (naf-18), n-13 ammonia, and rubidium-82. cms has performed coverage analyses for pet for oncologic, cardiologic, and neurologic indications, as well as infection and inflammation. this has included several uses of coverage with evidence development (ced), including one of the first ever registry studies to be approved and completed by the agency. many of these ncas have taken a year or more to complete, with the longest taking close to two and a half years. in march 2008, cms issued a decision memorandum for positron emission tomography (fdg) for infection and inflammation (cag-00382n).* the agency determined that fdg pet for chronic osteomyelitis, infection of hip arthroplasty and fever of unknown origin is not reasonable and necessary. in addition, since december 2000, cms has had in place a broad national non-coverage policy for pet. in the intervening years, preamble language non-covering all pet in the absence of a specific policy to the contrary has been included in section 220.6 of the manual, although not through a specific national coverage analysis. the manual continues to state that in general, a particular use of pet scans is not covered unless this manual specifically provides that such use is covered. cms revised the broad non-coverage policy in a march 2013 decision memorandum,* establishing mac discretion to determine coverage for pet using radiopharmaceuticals for fda-approved oncologic imaging indications. at present, a policy of mac discretion is in effect for pet radiopharmaceuticals for fda-approved oncologic indications, while national", "13666_1": " ?

fda-approved non-oncologic indications (including infection and inflammation), absent a contrary national coverage policy.il. mita supports proposal to retire infection/inflammation ncd mita supports the agencys proposal to retire the infection/inflammation ncd in favor of mac discretion for this indication of pet. we agree with cms that this approach will best serve the interests of the medicare program and beneficiaries. as cms notes in the proposed rule, leaving such determinations to local contractor discretion builds in flexibility to tailor coverage decisions to the pertinent facts of a patients case and considering any added benefit of fdg pet in establishing a diagnosis and treatment plan that might link the pet imaging to an improved patient outcome. the available clinical evidence in support of fdg pet for infection and inflammation has improved significantly since the non-coverage policy was adopted in 2008, and standards of clinical practice now support mac coverage of fdg pet for infection/inflammation. importantly, to effectuate the retirement of the current non-coverage ncd for fdg pet for infection/inflammation, cms will need to make a conforming change to eliminate the preamble language in section 220.6 of the manual. this language provides that a particular use of pet scans is not covered unless this manual specifically provides that such use is covered. if this language is not removed, the retirement of the ncd for fdg pet for infection/inflammation will have no effect, as the indications that are currently non-covered specifically under that ncd will simply remain non-covered under the general non-coverage policy for non-oncologic pet set out in the preamble.ii. eliminate manual language establishing national non-coverage for pet for non- oncologic indicationsa. elimination of national non-coverage language required to conform with retirement of infection/inflammation ncd cms should take the opportunity afforded by the retirement of the ncd for fdg pet for infection/inflammation and remove the blanket non-coverage language for non-oncologic pet, in order to promote beneficiary access consistent with the agencys current approach to coverage for innovative items and services authorized by the fda. mita believes that cms has the authority to eliminate this preamble language to allow for mac discretion with respect to coverage of pet for infection and inflammation and should do so. the language was not added to the manual by a specific ncd. instead, it is introductory language to the sections of the manual that detail specific ncd requirements with respect to coverage of individual isotopes including fdg (220.6.1-220.6.17), naf (220.6.19), and beta amyloid (220.6.20). this preamble language can be removed as a conforming change to the retirement of any ncd in section 220.6 of the manual. 5 85 fed. reg. 50258 (aug. 17, 2020). use of this expedited process to eliminate the preamble language is consistent with the supreme courts recent decision in azar v. allina health servs., 139 s. ct. 1804 (2019). as an initial matter, a//ina does not apply to the retirement of ncds because  1871(a)(2) of the social security act, applies to a rule, requirement, or other statement of policy ((other than a national coverage determination)). additionally, the agencys expedited ncd retirement process satisfies allina, as cms now proposes to implement expedited ncd retirements through the annual payment rulemakings, providing for notice and a comment period. eliminating this preamble language would be in accordance with the administrations october 2019 executive order to eliminate burdensome regulations that hamper coverage of innovative items and services for medicare beneficiaries. in particular, the administration has expressed the objective to minimize and eliminate, as appropriate, the time and steps between approval by the [fda] and coverage decisions by [cms]. no other fda-approved drugs are subject to national non-coverage established through preamble language in the manual rather than an ncd.b. recommended modification of ncd manual language", "13666_2": " removing-nationally non-coverage for all uses of pet would align the coverage policy for fda approved non-oncologic pet indications with the existing policy of mac discretion for fda approved oncologic pet indications. this result would be in accordance with developments since the initial preamble language was added, as clinical evidence and guidelines for the use of pet for non-oncologic indications have increased, and guardrails to promote appropriate use have been developed by medical societies and considered at both the fda review and cms reimbursement levels. to effectuate the proposed retirement of the ncd for fdg pet for inflammation and infection, mita recommends the revision of section 220.6 of the ncd manual to allow macs to determine coverage for pet using radiopharmaceuticals for all fda-approved labeled indications not specifically governed by existing policies (whether or not these indications were approved prior to the effective date of the final rule). below is recommended language: note: this manual section, 220.6 lists all nationally medicare-covered uses of pe t scans. s. except as set forth below in cancer indications listed as coverage macs may determine coverage within their respective jurisdictions for positron emission tomography (pet) using radiopharmaceuticals that are not otherwise non-covered by a ncd ncd for their food and drug administration (fda) approved labeled for 2 wing. effective for dates of service on or after  executive order on protecting and improving medicare for our nations seniors, oct. 3, 2019, available at https://www.whitel tive-order-protecti nations-seniors/. dal march 7, 2013, for approved label indications for oncologic imaging and january 1, 2021 for all approved label indications. as part of allowing macs to make coverage determinations for pet agents for non- oncologic fda-approved indications, cms should encourage the macs to develop coverage policies for pet imaging agents not otherwise addressed by an ncd. one approach that macs could take to add coverage of new radiopharmaceuticals or indications is through pet coverage articles that could be updated with new fda approved agents. such articles could be updated without requiring the full lcd process. cms should also confirm that when national non- coverage of an item or service is retired, the item or service is covered and eligible for payment on a claim-by-claim basis by the local mac until an lcd or local coverage article is developed.iv. support removal of ten-year threshold for expedited ncd retirement through annual rulemakings in the proposed rule, cms also solicits stakeholder comments on whether the time- based threshold of older which was designated as 10 years in the 2013 notice continues to be appropriate or whether stakeholders believe a shorter period of time or some other threshold criterion unrelated to time is more appropriate. mita believes that a shorter threshold would best serve the interests of the medicare program and beneficiaries. in particular, mitas view is that it would be appropriate to allow for the retirement of an ncd that more than five years old, or more recent ncds if there is new clinical evidence or fda approval that causes the ncd to be outdated or to restrict beneficiary access to medically necessary items and services. the fast pace of technological development in the life sciences makes it almost inevitable that coverage criteria may be unable to keep up with the development of evidence. shortening the ten-year requirement to five years, and adding a new clinical evidence exception, would allow for the expedited retirement of a non-coverage policy in cases where the full reconsideration process could pose a risk to beneficiary access.vv. conclusion and recommendation as discussed above, mita respectfully requests that cms:1. finalize its proposal to retire section 220.6.16 of the ncd manual, fdg pet for inflammation and infection.2. implement the revisions recommended in section iii.b of this letter to the preamble language in section 220.6 of the ncd manual, to allow for mac discretion to cover pet using radiopharmaceuticals for non-oncologic fda-approved labeled indications (both existing and new) that are not specifically governed by existing ncd policies.3. revise its guidance governing expedited retirement of ncds to make the expedited retirement process through annual rulemakings available for an ncd that was most recently reviewed more than five years ago, or within the past five years if there is 5 new clinical evidence based on which the existing ncd appears to be outdated or to pose a risk to beneficiary access to medically necessary items and services. we appreciate the agencys attention to these important issues, and its work to streamline coverage for innovative items and services to improve health outcomes for medicare beneficiaries. if you have any questions or would like additional information, please contact

on collaborative efforts to accelerate health information and technology adoption, advance information exchange between interoperable systems, and improve the quality and efficiency of care through the use of these important technologies. following are several of the primary points we make within the body of our comment document: cmss 2021 physician fee schedule proposed rule would require provider adoption of 2015 edition cures updates for the purposes of certified ehr technology (cehrt) compliance by august 2, 2022 for promoting interoperability and |qr participants. because the ehr association has concerns with the proposals interpretation of the timing of the expected readiness for both health it developers and providers, we highly recommend cms consider extending the flex period through the end of calendar year 2023. by adopting an amended timeline within the cms programs described, it would establish a more straightforward deadline and allow for more sufficient time for cures updates to be implemented by providers. on the subject of the mvp pathway, the ehr association agrees with the proposal to create a similar advancedmd cerner corporation epic medhost nextgen

however, we believe that this proposal contradicts the rationale for delaying the mvp pathway due to provider burden associated with covid-19 and also having to learn new reporting requirements. we recommend introducing both the mvp and app models at the same time to allow providers to understand their options and have more time to prepare for this change. although we understand the proposal based on the potential historical data discrepancies due to covid-19, we believe that solely basing mips scoring on performance benchmarks potentially penalizes providers by not allowing themto forecast and estimate their performance throughout the performance year. therefore, we recommend that the better of performance benchmarks and historical benchmarks should instead be used for scoring. ona related covid-19 note, we have been pleased that the declaration of a public health emergency has allowed cms to greatly expand reimbursable services that can now be rendered via telehealth. these changes have been welcomed by our healthcare customers at a time when patients were unable or unwilling to visit their doctors office in person, and have offered measurable benefit to patients that need care and accessto their providers, even while safely remaining at home. the healthcare industry has thus also had an opportunity to test the efficacy and clinical validity of the telehealth model on a scale previously unachievable, and the results have been overwhelmingly positive. we encourage cms to permanently codify telehealth expansion as a core part of the healthcare systems new delivery model. our detailed responses to the proposed pfs regulation follow. thank you for this opportunity to share the perspective of our members. we look forward to continuing to work with cms and other

efficient and time-saving. proposing to extend the definition of oud treatment services to include opioid antagonist medications, such as naloxone, that are approved by fdaunder section 505. the ehr

should this education be built into the current weekly bundled payments for episodes of care or should it be listed as add-on payment. the ehr association supports this proposal. based upon input from ehr developer clients, this change would prompt providers to include this type of patient education/resources as a part of the overall bundle being used to treat patients. proposing to create two add-on codes for naloxone. gotp1 (nasal naloxone) and gotp2 (auto-injector naloxone). the ehr association is supportive of creating these new codes which would allow for easier delineation of data for research and clinical decision support (cds). our clients have found that additional payment for naloxone is also a critical aspect tooud treatment andis necessary to help those with addiction issues as they work through the oud program. seeking comment on the addition of another add-on payment specific to injectable naloxone. our clients have found that payment for naloxone treatment canhelp assist patientsin their recovery process. periodic assessments required with these bundles have been allowed to be done via two-way telecommunications and audio only interactions. once the phe is lifted it is proposed to still allow periodic assessments to occur via two-way communications but not audio only. we support continuation of audio-only as well as two-way communications. many patients still experience difficulties in obtaining audio/video capabilities, but still need this beneficial assistance. comprehensive screenings for seniors: section 2002 of the support act. we request

medicaid pl and qpp ecqms againin 2021, however the abbreviated reporting period can cause concern. we would appreciate more guidance from cms related to ecqm measures that require an entire year reporting period such as the influenza measure. when calculating certain measures such as this example an abbreviated reporting period creates timing logic issues which could result in limited or no patients qualifying for the measure. updates to certified electronic health record technology due to the 21*t century cures act final rule (promoting interoperability and iqr). cmss 2021 physician fee schedule proposed rule would require provider adoption of 2015 edition cures updates for the purposes of certified ehr technology (cehrt) compliance by august 2, 2022 for promoting interoperability and iqr participants. the ehr association has concerns with the proposals interpretation of the timing of the expected readiness for both health it developers and providers. the cures act final rule communicated that a deadline of august 2, 2022 would be established for developers to make health it certified to the cures updates available to their customers. onc also specifically reiterated this in a july* response to a question submitted by the ehr association, where we requested clarification if this date correlated in any way to when healthcare providers would need to have cures updatesin place for their own cehrt compliance. * question to onc: does the 24-month deadline mean healthcare organizations haveto implement the new certified technologyand be using it, or does it mean it needs to be available from their health it vendor (but not necessarily in use) within 24 months? onc response: the provide its customer...by may 2, 2022 provisions require health it developers to solely make the updated health it available to its customers by the specified date. in the cures act final rule we state, in general, health it developers have 24 months from the publication date of the final rule to make technology certified to these updated criteria available to their customers, and during this time developers may continue supporting technology certified to the prior version of certification criteria for use by theircustomers. (85 fr 25666) these provisions do not require that the updated health it must be in production use by customers as of may 2, 2022. we recognize the separation of cms and onc respective authorities, where cms is tasked with establishing the timeline of requirement for adoption and use that would be associated with any applicable provider focused program. however, we want to make it specifically clear that the work to be taken into account for this adoption must be fully inclusive of the efforts of both health|it developers and their customers for development, certification, distribution, and upgrade activities. the initial timeline for health it developers to make available certified updates to all of their customers must be considered, followed second by the activities necessary for adoption and implementation by their clients. the cms deadline also falls in the middle of a program year, and does not provide a clear line for when providers would need to have these capabilities adopted relative to other annual implementation and reporting requirements. we understand cms intention to allow for a flex period for the use of 2015 edition cehrt as well as cures updates until august 2, 2022 to allow providers attesting to promoting interoperability the option to attest early in 2022, followed by later upgrades in 2022 or into 2023 to then attest to promoting interoperability later in 2023. however, this does not provide the same flexibility to those attesting to iqr or the a-apm track within the quality payment program, or those opting to use ecqms for quality within mips. we do not believe that cms proposal gives appropriate due consideration to the full weight and timeline of effort required for health|it developers to certify, and for providers to adopt, the cures updates whereby ability to meet program requirements is on par with previous use of prior versions of cehrt.", "19436_3": " while the cures updates are not a full criteria set update, they are still considerable. from past experience working with our provider customers, we have seen firsthand how much time is needed to install, implement, train, and adapt to new workflows and capabilities and to be at a level of use of the new certified capabilities to successfully attest tothe various cms programs. in the past, cms has had to either postpone required adoption dates or engage in declining to enforce them with every prior adoption requirement for a new version of certification criterion, and we believe it informative to the adoption of the cures updates to build in a flex period for their initial use. considering all of this, we highly recommend cms consider extending the flex period, currently proposed to end on august 2, 2022, through the end of calendar year 2023. by adopting this within cms programs, it would establish a more straightforward deadline for cures updates to be implement by providers and allow for sufficient time weare proposingto revise the shared savings program quality performance standard effective for performance year 2021 and subsequent performance years. this proposed revision would align the shared savings program quality performance standard with the proposed app under the quality payment programas participants in the shared savings program would be required to report quality for purposes of the shared savings program via the app. overall, this timeline and the lack of requirements are concerning for making this change in 2021. we would like to see more details. using an already existing methodology for submitting would make it simpler. however, requiring a different submission mechanism would complicate participation. the ehr association has previously requested a minimum 18 months for development. at a high level, the app would replace the current shared savings program quality measure set to streamline reporting requirements for shared savings program acos and would bea complementary path to the mips value pathways. the app is designed to reduce reporting burden, create new scoring opportunities for participants in mips apms, and encourage participation in apms. we agree with the proposal tocreatea similar mvp pathway specific to apms. however, we believe that this proposal contradicts the rationale for delaying the mvp pathway due to provider burden associated with covid-19 and also having to learn new reporting requirements. we understand that this proposal for the participation in an app will be optional; however, this is a brand new pathwayto providers and may be confusing with other changes of sunsetting the apm scoring standard and adding the mips apm type to the participation statuses. we support sunsetting the apm scoring standard and adding mips apm type to the participation statuses under mipsto achieve consistency in the 2021 reporting period and reducing provider burden. however, we recommend introducing both the mvp and app models at the same time to allow providers to understand their options and have more time to prepare for this change. although we understand the proposal based on the potential historical data discrepancies due to covid-19, we believe that solely basing mips scoring on performance benchmarks potentially penalizes the providers by not allowing them to forecast and estimate their performance throughout the performance year. therefore, we recommend that the better of performance benchmarks and historical benchmarks are used for scoring. weare proposing for the performance period in cy 2021 to maintain the electronic prescribing objectives query of pdmp measure as optional. the ehr association agrees with the proposal to allow this to be maintained as a bonus due to the lack of national standards and due to ehr integration complexities. we also agree with the increase of 5-10 points bonus. weare proposingto replace the word incorporating with the word reconciling in the name of the measure. the newname would read: support electronic referral loops by receiving and reconciling health information measure. the ehr association is in support of this name change, as it aligns the measure name with the eh/cah pi change finalized earlier this year in the ipps. we would, however, like to draw attention to the fact that multiple name changes can be confusing for healthcare organizations and health it developers supporting those organizations, since a new measure name has frequently been used (historically) to imply that the measures requirements have changed, which is not the case in this instance. name changes also result in software developers and other stakeholders needing to make tedious and burdensome updates to tools, processes, and materials, including report name changes, changes to documentation preserved for audits, updates to training materials, and updates to end-user facing documentation. time spent on name changes diverts resources from more impactful projects requested from users, such as usability enhancements.", "19436_4": " weare proposingto add the hie bi-directional exchange measure for the 2021 performance period and subsequent years as an optional alternative

are supportive of this proposal toremove measurements that do not add value to the quality of care, and instead add more meaningful measurements. as discussed in section iv.a.3.c.(1)(b) of this proposed rule, we are proposing to sunsetthe cms web interface measures as a collection type for groups and virtual groups with 25 or more eligible clinicians starting with the 2021 performance period. the ehr association supports this proposal, which focuses on electronically reported measures rather than abstraction, in alignment with cms interoperability initiatives. switching submission mechanisms and quality measure specifications is a large change for practices that have historically reported via the cms web interface, and we encourage cms toconsider feedback from clinicians, who voice concerns about this proposal and recommend a transition period of at least one year. weare proposingto add 2 newadministrative claims outcome measures, remove 14 quality measures, and make substantive updates to 92 quality measures where the changes will require the removal of an existing benchmark. the ehr association supports this proposal to remove measurements that do not add value

outreach to a selected third party intermediary, we intend on providing additional direction with regards to the timeline and information needed for the audit. the results of the audit will be reviewed to inform future approval ofa third party intermediary, and if remedial action is warranted, we will utilize our existing authority as describedin  414.1400(f). we believe use of this information in approval determinations will help reduce the risk of third party intermediaries that are unreliable, thereby avoiding a possible increase in burdento clinicians who may inadvertently select an unreliable third party intermediary for purposes of reporting for the mips program. we request comments on our proposals; specifically, we request comments on whether there are other factors that should inform our considerations when approving third party intermediaries. we understand the reasoning for performing audits on third party intermediaries. however, we encourage cms to remove the auditing of improvement activities for third party intermediaries. improvement activities have been and will continue to be a source of validation difficulty during auditing, because improvement activities aren't necessarily tracked within the ehr. these items are often narrative information tracked elsewhere by the provider, and thus should not be considered an auditable item for the third partyintermediary.", "19436_5": " although we are not proposing to add data validation requirements for health it vendorsat this time, we are considering ways to impose such requirements in the future. we are soliciting comment on whether we should impose data validation requirements on healthit vendorsas part of the third party intermediary approval process and ifso, howthe data validation requirements for health it vendors should differ, ifat all, from those proposed for qcdrs and qualified registries. we believe that potentially requiring health it vendors to validate the data they submit to us for purposes ofthe mips programwill lead to the submission of data that can be considered more reliable and accurate. therefore, we seek comment on the future application of such requirements on health it vendors and if there are factors unique to health it vendors thatshould be considered when developing such a policy. for instance, we are seeking to further understand where data quality issues may arise in data submitted by health it vendors on behalf of mips eligible clinicians. healthit vendors, through certification, do validate and generate and perform real world testing. if cms undertakes additional validation of quality measures, it should replace work already required by onc through the onc certification program and real world testing, toavoid duplicative efforts. weare also seeking comment on whether health it vendors currently submitting data on behalf of miips eligible clinicians possess the capabilities to engage in the data validation processes we are proposing for qcdrs and qualified registries. we are also seeking comment regarding the burden on health it vendors of adopting the data validation requirements as proposed for qcdrs and qualified registries and whether the imposition of these requirements on health it vendors would discourage health it vendors from serving as third party intermediaries. the ehr association opposes this proposal for several reasons. we do not believe that cms has provided enough detail regarding the proposed data validation for qcdrs and registries for us to offer an affirmative response to the question. additionally we feel that the request is likely duplicative of the certification, validation, and real world testing we are already performing. finally, regardless of the proposed changes, requiring additional, superfluous work of cehrt and health it vendors is costly and unnecessarily burdensome. we propose beginning with the 2021 performance period, a policy to truncate the performance period or suppressa quality measure if cms determines that revised clinical guidelines, measure specifications or codes impact clinicians ability to submit information on the measure or may lead to potentially misleading results. based onthe timing of the changes to clinical guidelines, measure specifications or codes, we would assess the measure on 9 months of data, and if9 consecutive months of data are not available, we would suppress the measure by reducing the total available measure achievement points from the quality performance category by 10 points for each measure submitted that is impacted. depending on the measure, changing a measure to a truncated period can create reporting data issues; this policy may not always be easy or even able to be implemented. we suggest cms consider a review period with stakeholders. we also have concerns about making these changes right up to the beginning of the data submission period.", "29803_0": "

b payment policies dear administrator verma: | am writing on behalf of the american psychological association (apa), the largest scientific and professional organization representing psychologists in the united states with more than 121,000 members and associates engaged in the practice, research, and teaching of psychology. psychologists provide medicare beneficiaries with critical mental and behavioral health services including psychotherapy, psychological and neuropsychological testing, and health behavior assessment and intervention (hbai) services. we thank the centers for medicare and

impact the proposed 10.6% reduction to the 2021 conversion factor will have on access to vital services for medicare beneficiaries. the losses incurred by psychologists who treat medicare beneficiaries will be felt across the country, especially in rural and frontier states where there are few mental and behavioral health providers. we understand that the fee schedule is subject to budget neutrality, but we implore the agency to work with congress to avoid the financial harm that such a drastic cut will have on all healthcare practitioners and their patients. for as long as the covid-19 public health emergency (phe) lasts, many medicare beneficiaries will be forced to live in isolation. the emotional toll this takes will exacerbate any mental or behavioral health issues they already have. we fear that many seniors, as well as younger beneficiaries with disabilities, will lose access to critical psychological services at a time when they are most vulnerable, unless cms and congress take immediate action to avert the proposed payment reductions. revaluing services that are analogous to office/outpatient e/m visits - behavioral healthcare services apa appreciates cms recognition of the importance of adjusting the valuation of certain services in the physician fee schedule (pfs) to reflect revisions to, and maintain relativity with, the updated office/outpatient evaluation and management (e/m) services. we are grateful that the agency recognizes that there are practitionersincluding psychologists--who are unable to report e/m codes, but who nevertheless provide services similar enough to e/m services to warrant commensurate increases in rvu values. we concur with cms that for psychologists in", "29803_1": " particular, such increases are important both to support access to behavioral health services through appropriate payment and to maintain relativity. e/m codes are designed to capture traditional physician office visits that include exams and medical decision-making. as cms states in the proposed rule, to receive payment from medicare for e/m services, the medicare benefit for the relevant type of provider must permit him or her to bill for e/m services. the services must also be within the scope of practice for the relevant type of provider in the state in which they are furnished. since clinical psychologists are non- md/do health care professionals who are not permitted report e/m services, we have developed our own specific codes to describe services analogous to traditional physician office visits. cms has proposed relativity adjustments to psychiatric diagnostic evaluation services (90791, 90792) and to the 30- minute (90832), 45-minute (90834) and 60-minute (90837) psychotherapy services. apa appreciates the methodology utilized by cms to calculate the proportional change in values for the standalone psychotherapy services. however, there are two additional factors that raise concern for us and our members. first, although commensurate increases in the work relative value units (wrvu values) to the selected codes are estimated to result in a zero percent impact on total allowed charges for clinical psychologists, as indicated in table 90: cy 2021 pfs estimated impact on total allowed charges by specialty (pages 50375-50376) of the proposed rule, when the new wrvu values are combined with the proposed 10.6% reduction to the 2021 conversion factor conversion factor (cf), clinical psychologists will see a small increase in payment for cpt code 90791 ($15.61), a minimal increase in payment for 90832 (+$0.71) and 90834 (+s0.08), and will actually see a decrease in payment for 90837 (-$1.49). second, relativity is fundamental to the way codes are valued in the medicare fee schedule. under the resource-based relative value scale (rbrvs), used by the american medical association (ama) / specialty society relative value update committee (ruc), healthcare procedures and services are ranked relative to each other based on the amount of physician work necessary to perform the procedure or service. while cms recognizes the importance of maintaining relativity between services that are analogous to the office/outpatient e/m visits, the proposed changes would not maintain relativity across the entire family of psychotherapy services. moreover, as presented in our february 10, 2020 correspondence (see enclosure 1), apa strongly believes that if the methodology utilized by the agency was truly applied to support access to behavioral health services through appropriate payment and maintaining relativity, then commensurate increases in wrvu values should be applied to the remaining codes in the psychotherapy code set (90839, 90845, 90847, and 90853), as well as to the hbai code set (96156-97170), and the psychological and neuropsychological testing services (96116, 96121, 96130-96133, 96136-96139, 96146) code set  both of which were valued relative to the family of psychotherapy services through the ama ruc process. this is evident in the ruc rationales for these three families of codes. apa recommends the cms accept the relativity adjustments outlined in our february 10, 2020 correspondence. if the methodology utilized for maintaining relativity is not extended to include the additional codes, it will cause anomalies in relativity among all behavioral health services. therefore, apa strongly urges cms to apply commensurate increases in wrvu values to uphold the relativity across all three families of behavioral health services provided by clinical psychologists and other mental health providers. telehealth and other services involving communications technology requests to add services to the medicare telehealth services list for cy 2021 as the agency explains in its discussion of telehealth services for 2021, the phe necessitated waiving certain telehealth requirements and expending options for practitioners to furnish services via telehealth, including audio-only telephones. we applaud cms for taking quick action so that medicare beneficiaries, at high risk due to their age and rate of co-morbid conditions, could avoid in-person interactions with practitioners without losing access to critical services. cms made several key changes including waiving the originating and distance site requirements, allowing providers to furnish telehealth services to new patients, and expanding the use of telehealth in skilled nursing facilities. as part of its response to the phe, cms added several services to its telehealth list, including group psychotherapy (cpt code 90853), the add-on code for the neurobehavioral status exam (96121), and psychological and neuropsychological testing services (96130-96133; 96136-96139), on a temporary basis.", "29803_2": " cms is now proposing to add the group psychotherapy and the neurobehavioral status exam add-on codes to the telehealth list on a permanent basis (category 1). the agency is also proposing to retain the codes for psychological and neuropsychological testing evaluation services (96130-96133) as category 3 interim telehealth services. cms is requesting comments on whether the psychological and neuropsychological testing administration codes (96136- 96139) should also be added to category 3. we strongly support the proposal by cms to make the codes for group psychotherapy (90853) and the add-on code for the neurobehavioral status exam (96121) permanent additions to the telehealth services list. doing so will allow medicare beneficiaries to continue accessing these important services under conditions where it is not feasible for them to travel or arrange an in-person visit. proposed temporary addition of a category 3 basis for adding to or deleting services from the medicare telehealth services list cms has proposed to add psychological and neuropsychological test evaluation services (96130-96133) to the cy 2021 medicare telehealth services list on an interim (category 3) basis. we appreciate that cms recognizes the need for these services to continue to be provided via telehealth for the duration of the phe. apa requests that cms also add the 3 codes for psychological and neuropsychological testing evaluation services (96130-96133) to the permanent (category 1) telehealth services list. testing evaluation services, which include interpretation of test results and clinical data, clinical decision making, treatment planning, report generation, and interactive feedback to the patient, family member(s) or caregiver(s), are similar to existing services, such as professional consultations, office visits, and office psychiatry services, which already are approved for telehealth delivery. comment solicitation on medicare telehealth services added on an interim basis during the phe for the covid-19 pandemic that cms is not proposing to retain after the phe ends apa is asking cms to add the psychological and neuropsychological test administration and scoring codes (96136- 96139) to the medicare telehealth services list on an interim (category 3) basis. allowing these services to continue to be furnished via telehealth on an interim basis will protect medicare beneficiaries from losing access to these valuable services, especially those living in rural areas far from the large cities and major medical centers where many psychologists practice. below are apas responses to the questions raised by cms concerning the criteria for category 3 services. while we are not advocating that all psychological and neuropsychological testing can or should be performed via telehealth it is critical that psychologists be allowed to perform these vital services not only for the remainder of the phe but also during the transition period after the phe ends in order to ensure continuity of care. psychological and neuropsychological testing services by whom and for whom are the services being delivered via telehealth during the phe most psychological and neuropsychological testing services are furnished and evaluated by licensed psychologists. in some cases, the tests may be administered by technicians operating under a psychologists supervision. as defined in cpt, psychological testing is provided to evaluate a patients emotional and interpersonal functioning, intellectual function, thought processes, personality, and psychopathology. neuropsychological testing is provided to evaluate a patients intellectual function, attention, executive function, language and communication, memory, visual-spatial function, sensorimotor function, emotional and personality features, and adaptive behavior. many of the testing services currently being provided via telehealth are for intakes, assessments, and feedback sessions. safeguards employed to maintain safety and clinical effectiveness of services delivered via telehealth in the current phe, psychological testing in person is not safe for the client nor the provider as proper social distancing guidelines are not able to be followed (wright et al., 2020). because it is important that vulnerable populations and individuals in need of testing services to direct care, coverage of telehealth services is essential to these populations. providing telehealth assessment in the approved testing cpt codes, will allow for psychological services to continue to be administered with maximum safety for both clients and providers and allow for the accessibility of services during the phe. apa has released guidelines and principles on how to best maintain standardization and ethical practices while administering services via telehealth in the field of psychological assessment (wright et al., 2020). there is a growing body of research with over 80 peer reviewed articles serving as the basis for psychological testing via telehealth. in addition to the empirical research establishing evidence-based practice for tele-neuropsychology (tele-np), the national neuropsychology professional organizations through an umbrella organization, the inter organizational practice committee (iopc), collaborated to publish recommendations/guidance for tele-np in response to the covid-19 pandemic (bilder et al., 2020). guidelines and best practices had already been established for telepsychology and these were considered foundational in the practice of tele-np guidelines for psychologists and other mental health providers furnishing services via telehealth include those listed below. the standards for educational and psychological testing and the apa multicultural guidelines apply to telepsychology just as they do to in-person services. for example,", "29803_3": " specific consideration of an examinees primary language as well as other important cultural factors such as level of education, acculturation, country of origin, ad socioeconomic status is important when considering test selection for telenp as these factors already pose challenges in traditional, face-to-face testing that is predominantly standardized with english-language samples. e american

has allowed for the implementation of this modality of service during the covid-19 pandemic. the established empirical evidence showing equivalence of tele-np to in-person standardized assessment allows neuropsychologists to provide clinically appropriate, evidence-based neuropsychological assessments to patients. provision of neuropsychological services are critical to patient care, and literature supports the incremental validity of neuropsychological assessment above and beyond other demographic, medical, and diagnostic variables while enhancing diagnostic decision-making, prediction of outcomes, and cost reduction. there is growing empirical evidence for the validity of tele-np. in 2012, bauer and colleagues co-authored a joint position paper of the american academy of clinical neuropsychology and the national academy of neuropsychology which set forth appropriate standards and conventions for computerized neuropsychological assessment devices (cnads). the position paper highlighted 8 key issues relevant to the development and use of cnads in the healthcare setting which included psychometric development issues, especially reliability and validity, the use of computerized testing and reporting services and the need for checks on response validity and effort in the cnad environment. this paper provided guidance for test developers and users of cnads to promote accurate and appropriate use of computerized tests in a way that maximizes clinical utility and minimizes risks of misuse. the positions taken were established to ensure that such tests were developed and utilized competently, appropriately, and with due concern for patient welfare and quality of care. in 2017, brearly et al. completed a systematic review of tele-np research to assess the effect of videoconference administration on adult neurocognitive tests. they investigated whether scores acquired during a videoconference administration were different from those acquired during on-site administration. relevant counterbalanced crossover studies were identified according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines. heterogenous data precluded the interpretation of a summary effect for videoconference administration. studies including participants with a mean age of 65-75, as well as studies that utilized a high-speed network connection, indicated consistent performance across videoconference and on-site conditions, however, studies with older participants and slower connections were more variable. overall, the administration of verbally mediated tasks by qualified professionals using existing norms was supported. in 2020, marra and colleagues reviewed tele-np validity studies. this systematic review extended the work of brearly and colleagues (2017) meta-analysis and provided an updated review of the literature, with special emphasis on test- level validity data. the review found good support for tele-np assessments in older adults. since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, additional equivalence studies are ongoing and some have been published in the extant literature(e.g., barcellos et. al, 2020). a 2020 study by harder et al, on home-based pediatric tele-np showed no significant differences in results obtained in the in-person first vs. remote videoconference first sessions or a change in performance across sessions. satisfaction ratings by participants and caregivers were largely favorable for the use of the videoconference testing format. this study was the first to validate home-based tele-np and the first to validate tele-np assessment in a pediatric sample.", "29803_4": " developmental testing services developmental testing services are a specific type of psychological testing and are therefore supported by the same literature as psychological and neuropsychological testing via telehealth. additionally, the same guidelines and best practices established for telepsychology and psychological and neuropsychological testing via telehealth apply for psychologists engaged in providing developmental testing services. adaptive behavior services apa also requests adding the codes for adaptive behavior services (codes 0362t, 0373t, and 97151-97158) and developmental testing services (96112  96113) to the medicare telehealth services list on a category 3 basis. telehealth is an effective method of providing adaptive behavior services, otherwise known as applied behavioral analysis (aba), services to children and families. evidence indicates that it is more beneficial to caregivers and children needing aba services to have a clinician assist in providing telehealth services, rather than a caregiver self- directing themselves with clinician provided information (e.g., watching videos). caregivers are satisfied with telehealth, to the same degree as when receiving similar services through in-person approaches. caregivers do not see telehealth as a disruption or too difficult to use. caregivers and children see more benefits the more frequently they use telehealth: they become more acquainted to it which results in better services for the entire family. there is a large body of research demonstrating the efficacy of telehealth for the provision of aba services (see references). as noted, it is also well established that early intervention is critical for the treatment of asd. telehealth allows patients to get access to services as timely as possible especially during the current public health emergency. in addition to the challenges of the emergency, the industry faces a shortage of trained providers who are necessary to conduct assessments, design treatment plans, and supervise the administration of services. services would otherwise need to be put on hold if the providers could not be physically present; telehealth helps ensure continued access to treatment. the continuation of services is critical to ensure children with asd maintain their progress and continue to develop new skills. telehealth has also been useful for providing access to group services as groups are no longer limited by geography. providers report parents/caregivers have been very satisfied with the use of telehealth during the pandemic. in addition, the use of telehealth has allowed for more flexible scheduling, which is often a barrier to meeting with parents who work during regular business hours that a treatment center is open. it has also allowed providers to observe first-hand the generalization of skills into the home environment. providers report continued progress and improvement in patient outcomes which is equally as important as patients satisfaction with the services. telehealth provides patients and their families with social support and ongoing access to these crucial services, regardless of their location. to ensure patient safety, there is a clinical assessment of each patient to determine if telehealth services are appropriate. patient progress is measured, and treatment protocols may be revised to ensure the services furnished through telehealth are effective. technical refinement to the medicare telehealth services list to reflect current coding we thank cms for updating the telehealth list to reflect the new health behavior assessment and intervention (hbai) services (96156-96171). we support the proposal by cms to amend its regulations so that when new codes are issued to replace codes that describe the same clinical services currently on the medicare telehealth services list, cms will consider those new codes to be successor codes and will update the telehealth services list accordingly. proposed technical amendment to remove references to specific technology given that many devices such as smart phones allow for video conferencing, we agree with the proposal by cms to remove the language which specifies that [t]elephones, facsimile machines, and electronic mail systems do not meet the definition of an interactive telecommunications system under regulation 410.78(a)(3)(i)-(ii). communication technology-based services (ctbs) the apa appreciates and strongly supports the agencys proposal to allow clinical psychologists and other non-physician healthcare providers to report and be reimbursed for e-visits on a permanent basis (hcpcs codes g2061g2063). clinical psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and soeech language pathologists are increasingly called upon to provide vital clinical services in flexible but effective ways. however, because of these providers inability to independently bill for e/m services, in many instances, patients were not able", "29803_5": " to access necessary treatment from the provider of their choice. we also support cms proposal to create an additional mechanism for reporting communication technology-based services (ctbs) by non-physician practitioners through the creation of the following hcpcs g codes: e g20x0; remote assessment of recorded video and/or images submitted by an established patient (e.g., store and forward), including interpretation with follow-up with the patient within 24 business hours, not originating from a related service provided within the previous 7 days nor leading to a service or procedure within the next 24 hours or soonest available appointment; and e g20x2; brief communication technology-based service, e.g. virtual check-in, by a qualified health care professional who cannot report evaluation and management services, provided to an established patient, not originating from a related e/m service provided within the previous 7 days nor leading to a service or procedure within the next 24 hours or soonest available appointment; 5-10 minutes of medical discussion. we believe the changes detailed above will allow beneficiaries greater access to assessment and management services from a much larger pool of provider types as well as facilitate their ability to receive clinically appropriate treatment. by expanding access to ctbs, the agency clearly recognizes the important role non-physician healthcare providers play in the comprehensive care of beneficiaries, and the ability of non-physician practitioners to provide clinically appropriate treatment for chronic and acute health care conditions. in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, digital technologies have proven to be an effective way for patients to continue receiving essential treatment and for healthcare professionals to effectively engage, monitor and provide clinically appropriate treatment. clinical psychologists have embraced this healthcare delivery method and are better equipped to assess and manage their patients health situations. with this in mind, we recommend that the agency consider expanding non-physician healthcare provider access to clinically appropriate remote patient monitoring services to meet the evolving needs and demands of their patients. non-physician providers are more than equipped to utilize information technology to collect a wide range of patient data outside of traditional healthcare settings, assess patient conditions, and respond to and act on any findings. further, as stated by cms on page 50113 of the proposed rule, we also note that in section ii.k. of this proposed rule we are proposing for cy 2021 to replace the evisit g-codes with corresponding cpt codes, and that this [sometimes therapy] policy would also apply to those codes. while we were unable to find any corresponding language in sectionll.k. of this proposed rule, we believe the agency was referring to replacing g2061-g2063 with cpt codes 98970-98972 which will reflect the updated code descriptions, (qualified nonphysician health care professional online digital assessment and management service). the apa strongly supports cms adoption of cpt codes 98970-98972 effective january 1, 2021. comment solicitation on continuation of payment for audio-only visits cms has asked whether services involving audio-only interactions should be permanently included in the physician fee schedule. apa believes audio-only behavioral health services, specifically, psychotherapy and hbai, should be covered permanently. even after the phe is over some medicare beneficiaries will find it easiest to access services via audio-only 7 devices, especially in rural and urban areas of the country that lack adequate broadband coverage. many beneficiaries live miles from a large metropolitan area and lack access to sufficient health care resources. limited physical abilities, lack of transportation, time, and other factors make it very difficult for these individuals to travel to receive care. in addition, many older individuals either do not have access to, or are unfamiliar with using, smart phones or other digital devices that allow for simultaneous audio and visual communication. even in cases where they have access to such a device, internet and cellular service may be inadequate. audio-only telephones are devices older patients are familiar with and, as shown during the phe, can be used to allow beneficiaries access to critical services, without putting this vulnerable population at risk. more than 20 years of research demonstrates that psychotherapy delivered via the phone is as effective as the care delivered in person. a review of 13 studies found significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression when therapy was provided via telephone (coughtrey and pistrang, 2018).", "29803_6": " patients report high satisfaction with telephone therapy (turgoose et al., 2018). in some studies, patients participating in teletherapy completed a higher number of sessions prior to dropout than those participating in in-person therapy (hernandez-tejada et al., 2014). evidence shows that a strong therapeutic alliance can be established when conducting phone therapy (stiles-shields et al., 2014) and even that suicidality can be reduced with interventions delivered over the phone (rhee et al., 2005). finally, prevention of relapse and improvement of health behaviors can be successfully achieved via telephone psychotherapy (baker et al., 2018). we ask that cms require a modifier when reporting audio-only services for psychotherapy and hbai services. doing so will allow the agency to gather data such as how frequently audio-only services are being furnished, which providers are using audio-only telephones with their patients, and how the use of audio-only services correlate with the patients age, economic status, education, or location. had a modifier for audio-only services been applied as soon as they were allowed under telehealth due to the phe, the agency would now have several months worth of data. cms might also wish to consider creating a list of audio-only services, which would be separate from the list of telehealth services. we realize the agency has concerns regarding program integrity for audio-only services. apa stands ready to work with the agency to develop appropriate guardrails to ensure program integrity for audio-only behavioral health services. proposed clarification of existing pfs policies for telehealth services apa supports the proposal by cms to clarify that services that may be billed incident-to may be provided via telehealth incident to a physicians service and under the direct supervision of the billing professional. direct supervision by interactive telecommunications technology we agree with cms that the direct supervision requirements under incident-to billing can be met through the virtual presence of the billing physician or practitioner using real-time, interactive audio and visual telecommunications. care management services and remote physiologic monitoring services transitional care management (tcm) cms is proposing to increase the work relative value units (wrvus) for transitional care management (tcm) codes 99495 and 99496 to keep their values commensurate with those of the level 4 and 5 outpatient e/m codes. tcm services are intended to improve the health outcomes of patients after being discharged from inpatient and certain outpatient facilities. as apa has stated in previous comment letters, psychologists routinely provide tcm services. for example, when a patient has been hospitalized for a psychiatric condition, post-discharge is a high-risk period, and it is critical to establish care as soon as possible. a psychologist providing care to a patient following a psychiatric admission must collaborate with hospital staff to facilitate the transition and contact the patient about moving forward with treatment. during the first appointment, the psychologist would assess the patient by documenting symptoms, psychiatric diagnoses, medical needs, functional status, pain control, and psychosocial needs following the discharge. the psychologist would engage family members in the care planning process, contact local support agencies if necessary, and communicate with the patients primary care provider regarding the patients mental health needs. these activities are all within a psychologists scope of practice. despite this work on behalf of their patients, psychologists are unable to bill medicare for these services because the tcm codes fall in the e/m section of the cpt manual. apa is requesting that cms revise its internal policies to allow psychologists to bill for tcm, as well as chronic care management and primary care management services, regardless of where the codes are placed in the cpt manual. scope of practice and related issues physician supervision in section ii.g. of the preamble (85 fr 50139) cms states we believe that physicians, npps, and other professionals should be able to furnish services to medicare beneficiaries in accordance with their scope of practice and state licensure, including education and training, to the extent permitted under the medicare statute, as long as it is not likely to result in fraud, waste or abuse. because of outdated language in the social security act psychologists are subject to unnecessary and burdensome requirements that all services be provided under the direction and supervision of a physician in some medicare settings. this makes access to psychologist services inconsistent across medicare settings and can delay treatment for medicare beneficiaries. partial hospital programs, skilled nursing facilities and hospital inpatient settings are examples where requirements that physicians certify, direct, and supervise all services hinders prompt patient access to psychologists services. as the leaders in the provision of psychological and neuropsychological testing services and health and behavior assessments and interventions, and as primary providers of psychotherapy, it is critical that psychologists working in a// settings be able to evaluate and treat medicare patients as soon as possible.", "29803_7": " removing this unnecessary physician supervision does not impact psychologist scope of practice or change the type of services psychologist perform. it only removes barriers to care for services that psychologists can already provide. additionally, removing unnecessary physician supervision would promote the coordination and delivery of integrated care. psychologists successfully serve as members of integrated team-based care in a host of clinical settings ranging from primary care to specialty care. the success of integrated team-based care is not dependent on physician approval of all services. in many states, psychologists scope of practice is independent and unique from that of physicians, which makes physician supervision requirements in medicare not only unnecessary but misaligned with state statutes. given the flexibility afforded other practitioners during the current phe we are asking cms to waive the physician certification, direction, and supervision requirements on psychologists so they too can furnish services in accordance with their scope of practice and state licensure, regardless of the treatment location. psychologists with prescriptive authority in addition, we wish to draw the agencys attention to the growing number of licensed psychologists authorized under state law to prescribe psychotropic medication. currently, louisiana, new mexico, and illinois have implemented state laws granting prescriptive authority to psychologists who have met additional rigorous training and practice requirements in clinical psychopharmacology. lowa and idaho are the most recent states to pass laws allowing appropriately trained psychologists to prescribe. in addition, certain federal agencies such as the us department of defense, the us public health service and the indian health service credential psychologists trained in clinical psychopharmacology with prescription privileges. psychologists with prescriptive authority are in great demand, but they can only work to the full extent of their scope of practice when treating patients covered by private insurance or medicaid. medicare does not recognize psychologists, even when legally authorized to prescribe, as being eligible to bill for evaluation and management services when performing medication management. consequently, authorized prescribing psychologists with years of experience in mental health services cannot prescribe or adjust psychotropic medication for medicare beneficiaries. this contradicts cmss stated goal of allowing all healthcare providers to practice to the full extent of their licensure. it also prevents medicare beneficiaries for accessing all the services that prescribing psychologists are legally able to provide. it is time for cms to revise its internal policies to recognize psychologists with prescriptive authority and allow them to operate fully within their scope of practice when treating medicare beneficiaries. we look forward to working with cms to implement these changes as soon as possible. other services that psychologists provide under their scope of practice but are not allowed to bill medicare for due to internal cms policies include smoking cessation services (under codes 99406  99047 and behavioral counseling for obesity services (g0447 and g0473). we request that cms revise its policies to allow beneficiaries access to all services psychologists can provide within their scope of practice. supervision of diagnostic tests by certain non-physician practitioners (npps) cms is proposing to permanently revise the regulation at  410.32(b)(2)(iii)(b) to specify that supervision of diagnostic psychological and neuropsychological testing services can be done by nurse practitioners (nps), clinical nurse specialists, physician assistants (pas) or certified nurse midwives to the extent that they are authorized to perform the tests under applicable state law and scope of practice. we strongly oppose this proposal because allowing these npps to supervise psychological and neuropsychological testing will put beneficiaries at risk for receiving inappropriate or inadequate testing which can result in inaccurate diagnoses and improper treatment decisions. psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation is a core component of psychological practice, treatment planning, and subsequent decisions regarding those served. psychologists are guided by professional standards of practice in engaging in psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation to be compliant with competency expectations and to avoid harm to patients. guidelines for psychological assessment and evaluation are important for use by psychologists to aspire to fair, respectful, and competent service delivery and treatment of examinees. (american psychological association. (approved by the council of representatives feb 2020). apa guidelines for psychological assessment and evaluation. washington, dc: american psychological association.) the guidelines also state that in order to supervise others in assessment/testing one must first demonstrate and maintain competency in assessment/testing.", "29803_8": " psychologists are uniquely qualified to select, administer, supervise, and interpret psychological and neuropsychological testing. psychologists very rarely administer only a single test; instead, they select a set of assessments and tests for each individual client. appropriate supervision to protect patients health and well-being is just as critical for psychological and neuropsychological testing as it is for other diagnostic tests. under the apa ethics code, psychologists only delegate work to others whom they know have the requisite competencies to perform such work (2.05 delegation of work to others; apa, 2017a). psychologists specifically do not allow testing, assessment, or evaluation to be done by unqualified persons, except when conducted for training purposes and with appropriate supervision (9.07 assessment by unqualified persons; apa, 2017a). the apa guidelines state that in order to supervise others in assessment/testing one must first demonstrate and maintain competency in assessment/testing. apa analyzed the licensing laws and regulations in the 10 most populous states focusing on the two types of npps most likely to fill this role: nps and pas. apa found that in none of these states do the licensing statutes or regulations for nps and pas: e list psychological or neuropsychological testing as part of their scope of practice (sop). 10 e list supervision of psychological or neuropsychological testing as part of their scope of practice. e require any training whatsoever in psychological or neuropsychological testing. in addition, the licensing laws for pas in the sampled states do not appear to include supervision of any services within their scope of practice. some of the sampled licensing laws recognize specialization for some nps and pas. but even the association that represents the most closely aligned specialty, psychiatric mental health advanced practice nurses (pmh aprns), recognizes that psychologists, rather than with pmh aprns, are trained to do psychological testing. in describing the overlap and differences between pmh aprns, psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers, the american psychiatric nurses association (apna) website says: psychiatric-mental health nurses have degrees in nursing. this means that the nursing process informs how they practice. at times, the role of a pmh-aprn with a masters degree may overlap with that of a psychologist, social worker, and psychiatrist. for example, all of these positions usually do psychotherapy. aprns and psychiatrists can prescribe, whereas psychologists and social workers cannot. psychologists are trained to do psychological testing and members of the other three disciplines are not trained in this way. [emphasis added] https://www.apna.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3292#1 it is important to distinguish between assessments done by psychologists and screenings, such as those conducted during primary care visits. (the american psychological association and american psychological association practice organization work group on screening and psychological assessment december 2014). assessment (including psychological and neuropsychological testing): e provides a more complete clinical picture of an individual e is comprehensive in focusing on the individuals functioning across multiple domains e can aid diagnosis and/or treatment planning in a culturally-competent manner e can identify psychological problems and conditions, indicate their severity, and provide treatment recommendations e integrates results from multiple psychological tests, clinical interviews, behavioral observations, clinical record reviews, and collateral information e may include screening measures that are used in conjunction with other information from the assessment, providing a broader context for interpreting the results e may use screening results to determine the choice of instruments for an assessment e may cover domains of functioning, such as memory and language, visual and verbal problem solving, executive functioning, adaptive functioning, psychological status, capacity for self-care, relevant psychosocial history, and others needed to respond to the referral questions 11 screening: e is used for the early identification of individuals at potentially high risk for a specific condition or disorder e can indicate a need for further evaluation or preliminary intervention e is generally brief and narrow in scope e may be administered as part of a routine clinical visit e is used to monitor treatment progress, outcome, or change in symptoms over time e may be administered by clinicians, support staff with appropriate training, an electronic device (such as a computer), or self-administered e support staff follow an established protocol for scoring with a pre-established cut-off score and guidelines for individuals that score positive.", "29803_9": " e is neither definitively diagnostic nor a definitive indication of a specific condition or disorder while we appreciate the role that other npps play in our healthcare system, their work in this highly specialized area should be limited to screening. therefore, we oppose the proposal to amend regulation  410.32(b)(2)(iii)(b) to allow these npps to supervise psychological and neuropsychological testing because they lack the necessary training and competency. proposed valuation of specific codes for cy 2021 billing and payment policies  periodic assessments cms has asked for comments on whether it should consider continuing to make add-on payments for audio-only assessments after the conclusion of the current phe and if so, whether the payment rate for audio-only services should reflect any difference in resource costs. billing for services under code g2077 requires a face-to-face medical exam or biopsychosocial assessment. during the current phe, cms revised its regulations to allow for periodic assessments to be furnished via interactive audio-visual communication technology as well as audio-only telephones. cms is now proposing to permanently allow for assessments to be done through audio-visual technology but not audio-only. apa believes that biopsychosocial assessments should continue to be allowed to be furnished via audio-only telephones. the type of information needed from the patient for this type of assessment can easily be gathered through a telephone call. talking by phone, elderly patients will not need special equipment or training and will require the least amount of assistance. allowing for biopsychosocial assessments to be furnished via telephone ensures that elderly and disabled patients can access these services from the privacy of their own homes. the quality payment program the merit-based incentive payment system (mips) value pathways apa supports the decision by cms to postpone the implementation of the mips value pathways (mvps) until 2022. we ask that cms include both the specialty societies and the qualified clinical data registries (qcdrs) in future discussions on the development of the mvps. promoting interoperability additional considerations  physical therapists, occupational therapists, qualified soeech-language pathologists, qualified audiologists, clinical psychologists, and registered dieticians or nutrition professionals apa supports the proposal to continue reweighting the promoting interoperability (pl) performance category to zero for certain non-physician practitioners (npps) reporting under the merit-based incentive payment system (mips). psychologists have never been eligible for the financial incentives offered to physicians to promote the use of certified health information technology (cert). because many do not utilize cert in their private practices most 12 psychologists would not have enough pi measures to successfully report. continuing to reweight the pi category to zero will protect psychologists and certain other npps from being unfairly penalized. mips quality measures apa requests that cms add cpt codes 96116, 96121, 96130-96133, and 96136-96139 to the specifications for measure #374 closing the referral loop, so that psychologists providing psychological and neuropsychological testing services can utilize this measure when reporting under mips. many psychologists whose practices focus on testing and assessment have few quality measures that they can report because the services they provide are not included in the measure specifications. this is especially challenging for neuropsychologists who do not see dementia patients. conclusion we thank cms for its consideration of our comments and look forward to seeing our recommendations adopted when the final rule is issued. if we can be of any further assistance please contact diane m. pedulla jd, director of regulatory affairs, by email at doedulla@apa.org or by

and management (e/m) visit, cognitive impairment assessment/care planning and similar services dear directors blackford and tee: as the largest scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the united states, the american psychological association (apa) appreciates the opportunity to respond to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) regarding potential systematic adjustments to services in the physician fee schedule (pfs) to maintain relativity for codes for psychological services with evaluation and management (e/m) code increases scheduled to take effect in 2021. as part of this proposal, cms outlined how it would meet statutory budget neutrality requirements on program spending by reducing payments for other services in the pfs with psychologists projected to see payment cuts of 7% in 2021. we are deeply concerned about the impact that the proposal to reduce payments for psychological services will have on medicare beneficiaries. there are compelling reasons why the agency must take action to assure there will be relativity among the codes billed by psychologists and other mental health providers in 2021. relativity is fundamental to the way that codes are valued in the medicare fee schedule. under the resource-based relative value scale (rbrvs) used by the american medical association (ama) / specialty societys relative value update committee (the ruc) healthcare procedures and services are ranked relative to each other based on the amount of physician work necessary to perform the procedure or service. we urge cms to adopt changes to uphold the relativity of valuations for psychological services to mitigate the effects of the proposal as presented in the cy2020 final rule. we also request the opportunity to meet with you to discuss the longer-term trend of declining reimbursement rates for psychological services, through both relativity adjustments as discussed in this letter and by exploring changes to the practice expense methodology which has consistently depressed valuations for psychological services, which we notified cms about several years ago. key points e beneficiary access to mental health services will be put at risk by 2021 cuts to pay for e/m e data analysis by the moran company suggests a 13% cut for psychology, much deeper than the 7% cut the cy2020 final rule projects e relativity should be maintained across codes for all psychological services e a long-term solution is needed to address problems with the medicare payment formula and budget neutrality

cuts in 2021 in the 2020 pfs final rule, cms accepted the rucs recommendations and finalized increased values, effective for cy2021, for the office/outpatient e/m codes. as a result, many provider types are projected to incur significant decreases in reimbursement. table 120 in the final rule projects a 7% reduction in payments to psychologists due to the need to maintain budget neutrality. while we support the revaluing of e/m services, many provider types, including psychologists, are statutorily ineligible to report e/m services in medicare and will not be able to mitigate the dramatic effect of a 7% decrease in reimbursement. it is imperative that cms explore alternative ways to maintain budget neutrality while also protecting providers from such burdensome losses as well as preserving adequate beneficiary access to the services they provide.", "29803_14": " preserve relativity among codes used by psychologists and other mental health providers apa strongly believes that if e/m increases are implemented in 2021 as presented in the 2020 pfs final rule the impact on beneficiary access to essential mental and behavioral health services will be devastating. we commend cms for acknowledging that there are other pfs services that have values that are closely tied to those of the revised e/m visit codes, and that it may be necessary to make systematic adjustments to those services in order maintain relativity across the fee schedule. in consultation with the moran company (moran), apa estimated the proportional increase in work relative value units (wrvus) that would be necessary to maintain relativity between the psychiatric diagnostic evaluations and visits and the cy 2021 for the office/outpatient e/m code set. estimates and calculations were based upon the example provided by cms in the cy 2020 physician fee schedule (pfs) final rule which specifically referred to the 45-minute psychotherapy code, 90834, and provided the following discussion: ...we are interested in comments regarding whether or not it would be appropriate to reconsider the value of the psychotherapy codes, as well as the psychiatric diagnostic evaluations relative to the proposed values for the office/outpatient visit codes. under the proposed revaluation of the office/ outpatient e/m visits, the proportional value of cpt code 90834 (psychotherapy, 45 minutes with patient) would decrease relative to work rvus for cpt code 99214 plus cpt code 90836. the current work rvu for cpt code 99214 when reported with cpt code 90836 is 3.40(1.90 + 1.50) and the current work rvu for cpt code 90834 is 2.0. under the proposed revaluation of the office/outpatient e/m visits, the combined work rvu for cpt codes 99214 and 90836 would be 3.82 (1.90 + 1.92). to maintain the proportionate difference between these services, the work rvu for cpt code 90834 would increase from 2.00 to 2.25. we followed this same principle to estimate the proportional increase in the wrvus for the other psychotherapy codes. for each psychotherapy code we identified the appropriate comparison codes and the total wrvu for the combined service under pfs cy 2020 policy. we then identified the total wrvu for the combined service under the e/m valuation structure finalized in the cy 2020 final rule for implementation in cy 2021. we compared the two by calculating the percent increase in the combined service wrvu under the new e/m valuation compared to current 2020 valuation. we applied that increase to the wrvu of the psychotherapy code to arrive at the proposed proportional wrvu increase for the psychotherapy code to maintain relativity. for example, the 60-minute psychotherapy code (90837) was compared to the combined service reported with 90838 plus 99215. in the 2020 pfs code 90838 has a wrvu of 2.50 and code 99215 has a wrvu of 2.11. the combined service accordingly has a total wrvu in 2020 of 4.61. when the new e/m values are implemented in 2021, the wrvu for code 90838 remains the same at 2.50, however the wrvu for 99215 increases to 2.80. the wrvu for the combined service accordingly increases to 5.30. the increase in wrvus for the combined service from a total of 4.61 to a total of 5.30 reflects a 15% change. to maintain relativity, we increased the wrvu for the 60-minute psychotherapy code (90837) by 15% from a wrvu of 3.00 to a wrvu of 3.45. we applied this same principle to calculate the proportional increase for the psychotherapy codes as outlined in table 1. the column titled proposed proportional wrvu increase reflects the updated wrvu we recommend to maintain relativity of the psychotherapy codes. page 2 of 7 table 1: estimated proportional increases in wrvus for psychotherapy codes cpt short descriptor | cy 2020 | %

relativity for code 90834 and believe it should extend application beyond just the codes that describe psychotherapy codes and psychiatric diagnostic evaluations. relativity must be maintained not only within all the codes in the psychotherapy family, but also between psychotherapy and the health behavior assessment and intervention codes, as well as the psychological and neuropsychological testing codes.", "29803_15": " in january 2019, apa presented revised valuation recommendations for the family of health behavior assessment and intervention services. below is an excerpt from the ruc rationale related to that presentation and corresponding changes in table 2.: it is also clear that there is an anomalous relationship in the surveyed family of codes when compared to the psychotherapy family of codes, on which it was based in 2001. the original and current surveys show that health and behavior services are very similar to the parallel mental health service, in terms of the modality by which the service is delivered as well as intensity. differences in comparable code values between the two families were greatly increased when the psychotherapy code set was reevaluated by the ruc in 2012. as detailed in the chart below, all the codes in current health and behavior code set are valued significantly lower when times and work rvus are calculated to match those parallel services in the updated psychotherapy code set. therefore, there is now relativity between the psychotherapy code set and the new hbai code set as demonstrated in the table below. page

in 2019 there were efforts to maintain relativity with the psychotherapy code set. applying the same principle described above, outlined in table 3 are the calculated proportional increases in wrvus for the family of health behavior assessment and intervention (hbai) services as well as the family of psychological and neuropsychological testing services, in order to maintain relativity with the

effects of the e/m increases and the corresponding impact on psychological services code families (psychotherapy; psychotherapy, and health and behavior assessments and interventions; psychotherapy, health and behavior interventions and assessments, and psychological and neuropsychological testing) at the specialty level. the estimates project the effect on each specialty overall of different approaches for implementing the e/m increases, assuming a conversion factor (cf) reduction would be used to maintain budget neutrality within the system. morans analysis also looks at the impact of the e/m increases with and without code gpc1x. gpc1x is a medicare-specific add-on hcpcs code for e/m office visits that cms proposed to implement for cy2021 to describe the complexity associated with visits that serve as a focal point for all medical care or for ongoing care related to a patients single, serious, or complex chronic condition. morans analysis projects an even larger adverse impact to the specialty of clinical psychology from the e/m increases than cms estimated in the final rule. moran acknowledges that they do not have sufficient information from cms to determine what is causing the difference between what the agency published and what their models suggest. estimates for how different scenarios would impact payments in 2021 are as follows:", "29803_16": " e that the e/m increases combined with the inclusion of hcpcs code gpc1x will result in an approximately 13% reduction to the specialty of clinical psychology compared to cy2020 levels (without any e/m increases). e if gpc1x is removed, there is an estimated 11% reduction to clinical psychology. e increasing the work relative value units (rvus) of the three code sets (psychotherapy, health and behavior interventions and assessments, and psychological and neuropsychological testing) proportional to the increases in the e/m wrvus appears to reduce the size of the overall cut to the specialty of clinical psychology as well as clinical social work. e implementing the e/m updates (without gpc1x) and corresponding proportional relativity updates to the three code sets, it is estimated that clinical psychology will only incur a 3% reduction for compared to cy2020 levels. e looking at the e/m increases (without gpc1x) we estimate that a 5.3% reduction to the cf is necessary to maintain budget neutrality. incorporating proportional increases into the three code sets would result in a 5.5% cf reduction. the overall impact on other specialties of these increases would remain relatively consistent with the original cms proposal, with similar overall reductions and increases in reimbursement rates. importance of psychological services to medicare beneficiaries psychologists provide medicare beneficiaries with critical mental and behavioral health services including psychotherapy, testing, and health and behavior assessments and interventions. psychologists are the leaders in assessing mental health and pioneered the development of health and behavior services to assist patients struggling with physical health problems. according to medicares utilization data psychologists provide 40% of all psychotherapy services, and along with licensed clinical social workers (lcsws), psychologists provide the large majority of the mental health benefit to elderly and disabled persons enrolled in medicare. page 5 of 7 psychologists are the leaders in assessing mental health and pioneered the development of health and behavior services to assist patients struggling with physical health problems. ata time when the country is faced with an epidemic misuse of opioids and other substances, psychologists can offer evidence-based nonpharmacological treatments to patients suffering from chronic pain, including medicare beneficiaries. despite the valuable services that they provide, psychologists are not adequately reimbursed in medicare. even after revising the psychotherapy codes in 2013 psychologists continue to be underpaid for their services by the countrys largest federal healthcare program. to illustrate, the nationwide medicare rate for a 45-minute psychotherapy service, the most commonly billed outpatient mental health service, is less than a dollar more than the amount medicare paid in 2009 ($94.55 vs $93.59). according to the consumer price index inflation calculator the reimbursement rate for a 45-minute psychotherapy session should now be $111.37, an amount more than 17% higher than what medicare currently pays for this service. this problem is not new. in 2014 we retained the services of avalere health (avalere), a leading quantitative and qualitative research analysis firm known for its work on healthcare issues including the medicare payment formula. after examining several years of medicare data avalere identified three main factors that combine to disadvantage psychologists under medicares payment formula:1. psychologists have practice expenses (pe) that are low, consist almost entirely of indirect costs (such as for office space, instead of direct costs for tangible medical supplies). since medicares payment formula reallocates indirect practice expenses across specialties each year to constrain the programs total indirect pe payments, psychologists payments are continually reduced to cover the increased indirect practice expense costs of other health care professions and newly developed health care technologies.2. psychologists are the primary utilizers of the few services (and corresponding cpt' codes) for which they bill medicare. although medicare pays the same amount for a service regardless of what type of health professional provides it, the indirect pe payment associated with a service is based on the weighted average indirect practice expense costs of all of the various specialties providing the service. most medicare services are provided by more than one specialty, and a lower-paid specialty can have its payment rates lifted when the higher practice expenses incurred by other specialties providing the same service are factored into the payment formula. since almost no other health care professionals provide the services that psychologists provide, the rising tide effect of the pe relative value unit (pe rvu)", "29803_17": " formula benefits other specialties, but not psychologists.3. psychologists bill medicare for a smaller number of different procedures than most health care professionals. many specialties benefit from billing a wide range of services, as the impact of a decrease in payment for one code is offset by increases in payment for other codes billed. psychologists have no such protection. in addition, most of these services are explicitly time-based; psychotherapy, the most commonly provided service, requires a specified amount of time (30, 45 or 60 minutes) for each patient. consequently, declines in medicare reimbursement rates for psychologists core services cannot be offset by increases in payments for other services, or by increasing the number of patients seen each day. working together, these three factors within the current medicare physician payment system virtually ensure that psychologists reimbursement rates will decline relative to both inflation and to other providers rates. the avalere study found that the primary cause of the decline in prices for clinical psychology codes since 2007 has been modifications to the practice expense relative value unit (pe rvu) methodology. first, starting in 2007, cms shifted to a new valuation process that estimated the direct costs associated with each code, and applied an indirect cost assumption based on data reported by the various physician specialties. this change caused an estimated 14% decline in prices for clinical psychology codes over 4 years next, starting in 2010, cms modified the survey data that it was using to determine the indirect costs for each code, and shifted to the results from the physician practice information survey (ppis).this change caused an additional 8% decline in prices for clinical psychology codes over the next 4 years 1 current procedural terminology (cpt) is copyright 1966, 1970, 1973, 1977, 1981, 1983-2018 by the american medical association. all rights reserved. page 6 of 7 as providers of low-technology but cost-efficient services, psychologists have experienced several years of shrinking payments, as medicare spends more for expensive, technology-driven services with higher pe rvu scores. lower-cost cognitive services such as mental and behavioral health assessment and treatment are consistently being devalued in comparison. since many psychologists work in solo or small group practices, continuing to participate in medicare while having their payments repeatedly cut puts their entire practice at risk. those who remain are more likely to limit the number of medicare beneficiaries they see in favor of patients who privately pay or whose insurance provides more competitive reimbursement. because medicare payment rates for psychologists services are estimated to be 17% below private sector indemnity rates psychologists are losing money each time they see a medicare beneficiary instead of a patient with private insurance. thus, shrinking reimbursement rates for psychologists are increasingly placing medicare beneficiaries who need mental and behavioral health treatment in the dire situation of being unable to access psychologist services. long-term solutions needed to protect psychologists payments maintaining relativity among the codes used by psychologists in 2021 is just an immediate fix to a much larger problem. the increased values for the office/outpatient e/m services is just the first of several e/m code subsets that will be going through the ama cpt/ruc process in the near future and then implemented into the pfs. valuable lessons learned from the process of revising the office/outpatient e/m codes must be preserved to ensure that access to services of mental health providers is not at risk with each e/m review. policy or regulatory changes that are made now will need to work in the future as well so that our providers dont face and have to fight the same battles each time. conclusion we thank cms

baltimore, md 21244-8013 submitted electronically via http://www.regulations/gov dear administrator verma: strategic radiology llc (sr) is a nationwide membership organization of quality- focused, independent radiology practices, wholly radiologist-owned and dedicated to performance improvement through data aggregation and sharing best practices. founded in 2009, the organization has a national footprint, representing 29 geographically dispersed radiology member practices with more than 1,300 radiologists combined who provide medical imaging services to more than 225 hospitals and 450 outpatient sites in 35 states. like most providers, when the covid 19 pandemic began, our members were forced to cancel all elective procedures to conserve personal protective equipment (ppe). this led to a dramatic decline in revenue that has moderated slightly with the relaxation of state orders and partial resumption of business. however, many patients continue to avoid health care settings, and we are continuing to see troubling losses and patients delaying their own health care needs. we have also been required to ramp down our patient encounters as a result of the need to adhere to strict infection protocols and scheduling complexities to achieve infection mitigation. these necessary processes have only added costs above our usual overhead. strategic radiology members support the proposed increase in payment for outpatient/office evaluation and management (e/m) visits as proposed in the 2021 medicare physician fee schedule (mpfs). as a result of these changes the cy 2021 conversion factor is proposed to be $32.2605, a 10.6 percent decrease from the 2020 conversion factor. these changes will result in significant payment reductions to all services, including radiology services in 2021, and although cms is projecting anwww.strategicradiology.org www.huronvalleyradiology.com 11 percent decrease for radiology, an analysis of our data shows an impact greater than 13%. in good times, cuts of this magnitude would be extremely difficult; under the present circumstances, they are insurmountable. in a survey of strategic radiology members, 80% report that this cut will directly impact care to patients. additionally, more than half of strategic radiology members report that their contracts with commercial payors are tied to current year medicare reimbursement, exacerbating the impact these cuts will have to their practices. over 70% of our members believe that these cuts will ultimately lead to decreased access to care to medicare beneficiaries. in that same survey, members were asked what measures would need to be taken to mitigate the loss of revenue as a result of these cuts: e 43% report that they will need to furlough or terminate existing staff. e 72% report that they will delay hiring new physicians. e 70% report they will reduce/restructure overhead (benefits, ancillary staff, outsource business functions). e 50% report that they will delay equipment purchases and/or equipment replacement. other members commented: e these cuts will limit our ability to subspecialize and invest in improving our practice. e quality and turnaround time may be impacted. we will not be able to hire quality subspecialty candidates and/or staff properly. e the drastic reduction in the conversation factor will make such an impact to our operations that we will have to lay off more staff just to offset the cuts. this will affect patient care if we do not have the staff available to meet the needs of the community. for our country's providers to remain resilient and continue to treat patients in this uncertain time, we ask that health and human services (hhs) use the powers granted to them under section 319 of the public health service act, specifically, the ability to waive or modify certain rule requirements as necessary to ensure that sufficient health care items and services are available to meet the needs of individuals in the medicare program. https://www.phe.gov/preparedness/legal/pages/phedeclaration.aspx in other words, we respectfully request a waiver of the budget neutrality requirements allowing (e/m) visits and other payment increases to occur without impacting other physician specialties. if waiving budget neutrality is not an option, we would request a delay of the anticipated cuts to radiology and other specialties while cms can further evaluate and study the impact these significant cuts will have on services rendered to medicare beneficiaries. during this delay perhaps congress will develop an alternative funding mechanism to solve this complexity.", "29831_1": " the aforementioned cuts would be extremely difficult and as noted would have a direct impact on our ability to deliver care.

under the physician payment schedule and other changes to part b payment policies dear administrator verma: the national association of social workers (nasw) greatly appreciates the opportunity to provide our comments on cms-1734-p. nasw is the largest and oldest professional social work organization in the nation, representing over 110,000 social workers. clinical social workers (csws) are the most abundant provider of mental and behavioral health services who participate in medicare and practice in a broad range of healthcare, mental health, and other settings. csws are an essential workforce in supporting individuals and families who are struggling to cope with the many impacts of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. evaluation and management services nasw supports the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) proposal to increase the work values of psychiatric services that are analogous to outpatient evaluation and management(e/m) services. since csws are reimbursed at only 75% of the pfs, these work value increases are imperative in incentivizing csw participation in medicare and ensuring an adequate workforce of csws to meet the mental health needs of beneficiaries, which have sharply increased due to the pandemic. while we support the cpt coding revisions and revaluations of e/m services recommended by the ama/specialty society rvs update committee (ruc), we strongly oppose the proposed10.6% decrease in the conversion factor (cf) to achieve budget neutrality (bn) for these and other pfs changes proposed for 2021. these cuts will have devastating impacts on csws, who already have been hard-hit financially by the pandemic, resulting in a major barrier to mental and behavioral health services during an unabating pandemic. rates of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder (sud) have spiked as a result of the ongoing public health crisis. these spikes, in turn, are contributing to higher rates of suicidality. older adults and people with disabilities, who are particularly socially isolated due to physical distancing requirements, are especially vulnerable to developing these conditions and to acute exacerbations of pre-existing mental health disorders. suicidality rates are also increasing, including among beneficiaries. these major cuts would also compromise access to medically necessary services, provide fewer choices of health care specialists, and force small health care practices to close, especially those in rural communities. medicare payments have already failed to keep up with inflation since the inception of the pfs in 1992. this decrease in the cf will be well below the 1994 cf. meantime, the number of beneficiaries continues to grow. we understand that cms believes that the proposed cf reduction is mandated by medicares bn requirement that relative value unit (rvu) valuation changes that exceed a $20 million threshold must be offset by payment reductions for other pfs services. however, of the $10.2 billion in additional spending attributable to changes described in the 2021 medicare pfs proposed rule, only an estimated $5.6 billion is attributable to e/m service changes adopted last year (cpt codes 99202-99215; 99xxx)). an additional $3.3 billion is attributable to the adoption of the new e/m office visit add-on code (hcpcs gpc1x) and the remainder to various other spending provisions in the proposed rule. thus, the modification of e/m coding and valuation finalized last year (cpt 99202-99215; 99xxx) accounts for only slightly more than half of the proposed cf reduction. we urge cms to exercise its administrative discretion to eliminate or substantially mitigate the proposed cf reduction. options it should consider include: 1) exercise its phe authority to eliminate or mitigate the impact of the proposed cf reduction. 2) eliminate the new e/m add-on code (gpc1x) 3) consider the negative impact of covid-19 on 2021 e/m visit utilization projections to calculate the bn adjustment review its bn calculations to ensure that it accurately reflects the e/m billing policies that will become effective in 2021. utilize previous over-estimated spending to reduce the bn adjustment  4  5  we urge cms to collaborate with csws and the many other medicare provider groups to develop and implement a final rule that will achieve the agencys goal to promote improvements in patient care and management. telehealth services nasw commends cms for expanding telehealth services to meet the needs of medicare", "28796_1": " beneficiaries during the pandemic. this expansion has been instrumental in enabling csws to provide urgently needed mental and behavioral health services to millions of beneficiaries. we support the proposed permanent addition of 90853, group therapy, to the list of telehealth psychiatric services. we especially commend the agency for reimbursing for audio-only services during the pandemic and urge cms to make this expansion permanent for mental health and other services. the need for mental and behavioral services will continue well beyond the conclusion of the public health emergency. we believe cms has the authority to proceed with this policy permanence without specific congressional authorization. the current statutory authority under section 1834m of the social security act allows cms to make this change now without further direction from or action by congress. we recommend the development and deployment of a modifier for billing an audio-only mental and behavioral health service. this would enable psychiatric telehealth services to be identified and reflective of the service being performed. in addition, nasw urges cms to eliminate the originating and geographic site requirements in the pre-covid medicare telehealth policy. medicare beneficiaries should have a choice of where they receive telehealth services. traveling to originating and geographic sites to receive psychiatric services has been a burden and barrier to receiving care for those who are homebound and/or lack transportation, among others. the positive impacts of telehealth expansion during the covid-19 have demonstrated the value of receiving mental health services outside originating or specified geographic sites. quality payment program nasw appreciates cms development of a new set of measures for use by csws for the quality payment program (qpp). these measures alleviate reporting problems encountered with the prior medicare quality measurement and reporting program. we also commend cms for clarifying with the medicare administrative contractors and others the appropriate measures for use by csws. for the calendar year 2021 and beyond, we recommend that csws be reinstated as eligible providers in the qpp. comprehensive screenings for seniors: section 2002 of the support act nasw strongly supports the proposal to review beneficiaries potential risk factors for opioid use disorder to include an evaluation of the individuals severity of pain and current treatment plan, an educational information on nonopioid treatment options, and a referral to a specialist. we also strongly support a review of the beneficiarys risk factors for suds and a referral to treatment if appropriate. both reviews are important to the screening of seniors for substance use. thank you again for the

to payment policies under the physician fee schedule and other changes to part b payment policies [cms-1734-p]. columbiadoctors is the faculty practice plan of the columbia university irving medical center. with over 2,200 practicing physicians and other health professionals, columbiadoctors is one of the largest group practices in the northeast. we provide the highest quality care for all those who need it. last year, our clinicians saw more than 350,000 unique patients for nearly 1.5 million visits. this year has been challenging for columbiadoctors. when new york city became the epicenter of the covid-19 crisis in april of this year, our front-line staff and other team employees, in collaboration with our partners at newyork-presbyterian, worked around the clock to save lives. washington heights, where we are located, was one of the hottest spots in new york. we also made huge investments to increase icu and equipment capacity, testing capabilities, fever clinics to divert non covid patients, and other steps to combat the pandemic. throughout the covid-19 pandemic our doctors and their colleagues have been on the frontlines. we wholeheartedly endorse and support the comments made by the amga of which we are amember. the amga letter (see attached) goes into further detail but in short, our recommendations are as follows: payment for evaluation and management (e/m) services: e cms should not finalize its proposal to increase the relative value units (rvus) for the evaluation and management (e/m) codes due to the significant decrease in the conversion factor. this decrease, when combined with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, would create significant financial hardship for various specialties. telehealth e while outside the scope of this proposed rule, columbiadoctors recommends that cms exercise all administrative authority at its disposal to waive the telehealth geographic and originating site requirements. e columbiadoctors believes that telehealth will be a core service moving forward and supports cms efforts to add additional codes to the medicare telehealth list. e columbiadoctors supports the proposal to add a number of codes to the category 1 telehealth list. audio-only e columbiadoctors strongly recommends that cms permanently add payment for telephone-only services. medicare shared savings program e apm performance pathway (app): while columbiadoctors supports burden reduction and streamlining quality reporting for entities participating in value- based models, we are concerned about the extent to which cms is reducing the medicare shared savings program (mssp) quality measure set. cms should not implement the app as proposed and should work to implement a mix of outcomes and process measures that align across various programs. additionally, columbiadoctors does not support cms proposal to end the quality phase in with the implementation of the app. e cms should not apply the quality performance standard to shared savings the way it is proposed. acos should not be ineligible to share in savings if they do not meet the more stringent quality performance standard. quality payment program e app: columbiadoctors supports the use of the app as a scoring pathway for merit-based incentive payment system (mips) alternative payment models (apms), as long as cms maintains its other reporting mechanisms in the process. e cms web interface: columbiadoctors opposes the elimination of the cms web interface, as doing so would impose undue burden on aco participants. e cost performance category: columbiadoctors recommends that there be more modeling on the impact of adding the costs associated with providing these telehealth services to the previously established cost measures. e quality measure benchmarks: columbiadoctors supports cms intended approach of using performance period benchmarks for the cy 2021 performance period. furthermore, as to telehealth, although not within the scope of the physician fee schedule, columbiadoctors recommends that cms look for additional ways to remove or lessen the barriers to increased use of telehealth, notably state licensing requirements and other regulations that prevent or make it more difficult for physicians to see patients from another state via telehealth.", "29671_1": " the covid-19 crisis has forever changed the way we use telehealth. prior to the pandemic, our faculty were seeing around 200 patients a day via telehealth. during the height of the pandemic, that number rose to 2,000 thousand patients daily at its peak. as the crisis has abated, that number has leveled off somewhat to around 1,500 telehealth visits per day, but it is clear that telehealth will play an even larger role in patient care going forward. we appreciate all the steps that you and secretary azar have taken to encourage states to reduce licensing barriers. many states, including new jersey and connecticut, not surprisingly, the largest source of our out of state patients, have done so. once the public health crisis is over however, many of these licensing barriers will come back, thus potentially preventing many of our doctors from seeing their out of state patients via telehealth. state borders should not prevent patients from seeing the provider of their choice. in addition to the amga comments, we endorse and fully support the comments of newyork quality care (nyqc), the accountable care organization (aco) of new-york presbyterian, weill cornell medicine and columbiadoctors. nyqc is a track 1 medicare shared savings program aco that started in 2015 with more than 37,000 attributed beneficiaries who reside mostly in new york city, long island, new jersey and westchester. our aco is committed to providing high quality, well-coordinated and cost-effective care and services to our patients, aligning with the goals of the mssp program. in 2019, nyqc reduced the total annual cost for its attributed beneficiaries by more than $23 million compared to the risk-adjusted benchmark. nyqcs comments are also attached to these comments. thank you for the opportunity to comment on the physician

years of development, a wealth of experience has accumulated in the practice of acupuncture, attesting to the wide range of diseases and conditions that can be effectively treated with this approach. unlike many other traditional methods of treatment, which tend to be specific to their national or cultural context, acupuncture has been used throughout the world, particularly since the 1970s. in recognition of the increasing worldwide interest in the subject, the world health organization (who) conducted a symposium on acupuncture in june 1979 in beijing, china. physicians practising acupuncture in different countries were invited to identify the conditions that might benefit from this therapy. the participants drew up a list of 43 suitable diseases. however, this list of indications was not based on formal clinical trials conducted in a rigorous scientific manner, and its credibility has been questioned. the past two decades have seen extensive studies on acupuncture, and great efforts have been made to conduct controlled clinical trials that include the use of sham acupuncture or placebo acupuncture controls. although still limited in number because of the difficulties of carrying out such trials, convincing reports, based on sound research methodology, have been published. in addition, experimental investigations on the mechanism of acupuncture have been carriedout. this research, while aimed chiefly at answering how acupuncture works, may also provide evidence in support of its effectiveness. in 1991, a progress report on traditional medicine and modern health care was submitted by the director-general of who to the forty-fourth world health assembly.! the report pointed out that in countries where acupuncture forms part of the cultural heritage, its use in an integrated approach to modern and traditional medicine presents no difficulty. however, in countries where modern western medicine is the foundation of health care, the ethical use of acupuncture requires objective evidence of its efficacy under controlled clinical conditions. in 1996, a draft report on the clinical practice of acupuncture was reviewed at the who consultation on acupuncture held in cervia, italy. the participants recommended that who should revise the report, focusing on data from controlled clinical trials. this publication is the outcome of that process. ' traditional medicine and modern health care. progress report by the director-general. geneva, world health organization, 1991 (unpublished document a44/10). acupuncture: review and analysis of controlled clinical trials objectives the objective of this publication is to provide a review and analysis of controlled clinical trials of acupuncture therapy, as reported in the current literature, with a view to strengthening and promoting the appropriate use of acupuncture in health care systems throughout the world. information on the therapeutic mechanisms of acupuncture has also been incorporated.", "25263_1": " since the methodology of clinical research on acupuncture is still under debate, it is very difficult to evaluate acupuncture practice by any generally accepted measure. this review is limited to controlled clinical trials that were published up to 1998 (and early 1999 for some journals), in the hope that the conclusions will prove more acceptable. such trials have only been performed for a limited number of diseases or disorders. this should not be taken to mean, however, that acupuncture treatment of diseases or disorders not mentioned here is excluded. use of the publication this publication is intended to facilitate research on and the evaluation and application of acupuncture. it is hoped that it will provide a useful resource for researchers, health care providers, national health authorities and the general public. it must be emphasized that the list of diseases, symptoms or conditions covered here is based on collected reports of clinical trials, using the descriptions given in those reports. only national health authorities can determine the diseases, symptoms and conditions for which acupuncture treatment can be recommended. the data in the reports analysed were not always clearly recorded. we have made every effort to interpret them accurately, in some cases maintaining the original wording in the text and summary table presented here. research on traditional medicine, including acupuncture is by no means easy. however, researchers should be encouraged to ensure the highest possible standards of study design and reporting in future research in order to improve the evidence base in this field. dr xiaorui zhang acting coordinator traditional medicine (trm) department of essential drugs and medicines policy (edm) world

combination with moxibustionthe burning on or over the skin of selected herbsand may also involve the application of other kinds of stimulation to certain points. in this publication the term acupuncture is used in its broad sense to include traditional body needling, moxibustion, electric acupuncture (electro-acupuncture), laser acupuncture  (photo- acupuncture), microsystem acupuncture such as ear (auricular), face, hand and scalp acupuncture, and acupressure (the application of pressure at selected sites).1.2 need for evaluation acupuncture originated in china many centuries ago and soon spread to japan, the korean peninsula and elsewhere in asia. acupuncture is widely used in health care systems in the countries of this region; it is officially recognized by governments and well received by the general public. although acupuncture was introduced to europe as long ago as the early seventeenth century, scepticism about its effectiveness continues to exist in countries where modern western medicine is the foundation of health care, especially in those where acupuncture has not yet been widely practised. people question whether acupuncture has a true therapeutic effect, or whether it works merely through the placebo effect, the power of suggestion, or the enthusiasm with which patients wish for a cure. there is therefore a need for scientific studies that evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture under controlled clinical conditions. this publication reviews selected studies on controlled clinical trials. some of these studies have provided incontrovertible scientific evidence that acupuncture is more successful than placebo treatments in certain conditions. for example, the proportion of chronic pain relieved by acupuncture is generally in the range 55- 85%, which compares favourably with that of potent drugs (morphine helps in 70% of cases) and far outweighs the placebo effect (30-35%) (1-3). in addition, the mechanisms of acupuncture analgesia have been studied extensively since the late 1970s, revealing the role of neural and humoral factors.1.3 evaluation methodology unlike the evaluation of a new drug, controlled clinical trials of acupuncture are extremely difficult to conduct, particularly if they have to be blind in design and the acupuncture has to be compared with a placebo. various sham or placebo acupuncture procedures have been designed, but they are not easy to acupuncture: review and analysis of controlled clinical trials perform in countries such as china where acupuncture is widely used. in these countries, most patients know a great deal about acupuncture, including the special sensation that should be felt after insertion or during manipulation of the needle. moreover, acupuncturists consider these procedures unethical because they are already convinced that acupuncture is effective. in fact, most of the placebo-controlled clinical trials have been undertaken in countries where there is scepticism about acupuncture, as well as considerable interest.", "25263_2": " a more practical way to evaluate the therapeutic effect of acupuncture is to compare it with the effect of conventional therapy through randomized controlled trials or group studies, provided that the disease conditions before treatment are comparable across the groups, with outcome studies developed for all patients. because of the difficulty of ruling out the placebo effect, a comparative study with no treatment as the control may not be convincing in the evaluation of acupuncture practice. retrospective surveys, in which the effect of acupuncture therapy is compared with past treatments, may not be of significance either, particularly if they have not been well designed. non-comparative studies are certainly of little significance, particularly when acupuncture is used for the treatment of a self-limited disease. however, if rapid improvement can be achieved in the treatment of a long-standing, chronic disease, or if there is definite improvement in a disease that is generally recognized as intractable to conventional treatment, the effect of acupuncture should be viewed in a more favourable light, even when a well-designed, controlled study has not been carried out. another difficulty in evaluating acupuncture practice is that the therapeutic effect depends greatly on the proficiency of the acupuncturists  their ability and skill in selecting and locating the acupuncture points and in manipulating the needles. this may partly explain the disparities or inconsistencies in the results reported by different authors, even when their studies were carried out on equally sound methodological bases. evaluating acupuncture practice and arriving at generally accepted conclusions is no easy task, therefore. while effectiveness is doubtless of the utmost importance, other factors, including safety, cost, availability and the condition of local health services must also be considered. given the same effectiveness, these other factors may lead to different evaluations of acupuncture in different countries and areas. however, conclusions are needed that apply to worldwide use, particularly for countries and areas where proper development of acupuncture practice would bring a great deal of benefit. evaluations should not therefore be confined to those diseases for which modern conventional treatments are inadequate or ineffective. because of the success of surgical procedures carried out under acupuncture analgesia, the treatment of pain with acupuncture has been extensively studied. for other conditions often treated with acupuncture, there are fewer reports that have adequate methodology.1. general considerations 14 safety generally speaking, acupuncture treatment is safe if it is performed properly by a well-trained practitioner. unlike many drugs, it is non-toxic, and adverse reactions are minimal. this is probably one of the chief reasons why acupuncture is so popular in the treatment of chronic pain in many countries. as mentioned previously, acupuncture is comparable with morphine preparations in its effectiveness against chronic pain, but without the adverse effects of morphine, such as dependency. even if the effect of acupuncture therapy is less potent than that of conventional treatments, acupuncture may still be worth considering because of the toxicity or adverse effects of conventional treatments. for example, there are reports of controlled clinical trials showing that acupuncture is effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (4-6), although not as potent as corticosteroids. because, unlike corticosteroids, acupuncture treatment, does not cause serious side-effects, it seems reasonable to use acupuncture for treating this condition, despite the difference in effectiveness.1.5 availability and practicability the availability and practicability of acupuncture are also important factors to consider. the advantages of acupuncture are that it is simple, convenient and has few contraindications. although the success rate of acupuncture therapy in treating kidney stones, for example, is confirmed by comparative studies with other therapies (7), it is by no means as high as that of surgical intervention. however, acupuncture treatment of kidney stones is still worth recommending because of its simplicity, which makes it more acceptable to patients. there are also instances where acupuncture is not more practicable than conventional therapy. for example, the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment of acute bacillary dysentery has been shown to be comparable with that of furazolidone (8-10), but this is of rather academic significance because oral administration of furazolidone or other antidysenteric drugs is more convenient. the conditions of the health service in a given country or area should also be considered in evaluating acupuncture practice. in developing countries, where medical personnel and medicines are still lacking, the need for acupuncture may be considerable and urgent; proper use of this simple and economic therapy could benefit a large number of patients. on the other hand, in developed countries, where the health system is well established, with sophisticated technology, adequate personnel and a well-equipped infrastructure, acupuncture might be considered to be of great value in only a limited number of conditions.", "25263_3": " it could still serve as a valuable alternative treatment for many diseases or conditions for which modern conventional treatments are unsuccessful. it is also valuable in situations where the patient is frightened of the potential risks or adverse effects of modern conventional treatments. in fact, in some developed countries, the diseases for which patients seek help from acupuncturists tend to be beyond the scope of orthodox medicine. acupuncture: review and analysis of controlled clinical trials1.6 studies on therapeutic mechanisms clinical evaluations indicate whether the therapy works; research on the mechanisms involved indicates how it works and can also provide important information on efficacy. knowing that acupuncture is effective and why makes the practitioner confident in its use, and also allows the technique to be used in a more appropriate way. the clinical evaluation may precede studies on the mechanisms, or vice versa. for acupuncture, in most instances the clinical effect has been tested first. use of the technique may then be further expanded on the basis of the results of research on the mechanisms. for example, experimental studies of the effect of acupuncture on white blood cells led to a successful trial of the treatment of leukopenia caused by chemotherapy. to date, modern scientific research studies have revealed the following actions of acupuncture: e inducing analgesia e protecting the body against infections e regulating various physiological functions. in reality, the first two actions can also be attributed to the regulation of physiological functions. the therapeutic effects of acupuncture are thus brought about through its regulatory actions on various systems, so that it can be regarded as a nonspecific therapy with a broad spectrum of indications, particularly helpful in functional disorders. although it is often used as a symptomatic treatment (for pain, for instance), in many cases it actually acts on one of the pathogenic links of a disease. although different acupuncture points and manipulations may have an effect through different actions, the most important factor that influences the direction of action is the condition of the patient. numerous examples reveal that the regulatory action of acupuncture is bi-directional. acupuncture lowers the blood pressure in patients with hypertension and elevates it in patients with hypotension; increases gastric secretion in patients with hypoacidity, and decreases it in patients with hyperacidity; and normalizes intestinal motility under x-ray observation in patients with either spastic colitis or intestinal hypotonia (11). therefore, acupuncture itself seldom makes the condition worse. in most instances, the main danger of its inappropriate application is neglecting the proper conventional treatment. since its therapeutic actions are achieved by mobilization of the organisms own potential, acupuncture does not produce adverse effects, as do many drug therapies. for example, when release of hydrocortisone plays an important role in the production of a therapeutic effect, the doses of this substance released by acupuncture are small and finely regulated, thereby avoiding the side-effects of hydrocortisone chemotherapy (12). on the other handand for the same reason  acupuncture has limitations. even under conditions where acupuncture is indicated, it may not work if the mobilization of the individuals potential is not adequate for recovery.1. general considerations1.7 selection of clinical trial reports in recent decades, numerous clinical trials have been reported; however, only formally published articles that meet one of the following criteria are included in this review: e randomized controlled trials (mostly with sham acupuncture or conventional therapy as control) with an adequate number of patients observed; e nonrandomized controlled clinical trials (mostly group comparisons) with an adequate number of patients observed and comparable conditions in the various groups prior to treatment. in many published placebo-controlled trials, sham acupuncture was carried out by needling at incorrect, theoretically irrelevant sites. such a control really only offers information about the most effective sites of needling, not about the specific effects of acupuncture (13). positive results from such trials, which revealed that genuine acupuncture is superior to sham acupuncture with statistical significance, provide evidence showing the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment. on the other hand, negative results from such trials, in which both the genuine and sham acupuncture showed considerable therapeutic effects with no significant difference between them, can hardly be taken as evidence negating the effectiveness of acupuncture. in the latter case, especially in treatment of pain, most authors could only draw the conclusion that additional control studies were needed. therefore, these reports are generally not included in this review.", "25263_4": " the reports are first reviewed by groups of conditions for which acupuncture therapy is given (section 2). the clinical conditions covered have then been classified into four categories (section 3):1. diseases, symptoms or conditions for which acupuncture has been proved  through controlled trials  to be an effective treatment.2. diseases, symptoms or conditions for which the therapeutic effect of acupuncture has been shown, but for which further proof is needed.3. diseases, symptoms or conditions for which there are only individual controlled trials reporting some therapeutic effects, but for which acupuncture is worth trying because treatment by conventional and other therapies is difficult. 4, diseases, symptoms or conditions in which acupuncture may be tried provided the practitioner has special modern medical knowledge and adequate monitoring equipment. section 4 provides a tabulated summary of the controlled clinical trials reviewed, giving information on the number of subjects, the study design, the type of acupuncture applied, the controls used and the results obtained. acupuncture: review and analysis of controlled clinical trials2. review of clinical trial reports2. review of clinical trial reports2.1 pain the effectiveness of acupuncture analgesia has already been established in controlled clinical studies. as mentioned previously, acupuncture analgesia works better than a placebo for most kinds of pain, and its effective rate in the treatment of chronic pain is comparable with that of morphine. in addition, numerous laboratory studies have provided further evidence of the efficacy of acupunctures analgesic action as well as an explanation of the mechanism involved. in fact, the excellent analgesic effects of acupuncture have stimulated research on pain. because of the side-effects of long-term drug therapy for pain and the risks of dependence, acupuncture analgesia can be regarded as the method of choice for treating many chronically painful conditions. the analgesic effect of acupuncture has also been reported for the relief of eye pain due to subconjunctival injection (14), local pain after extubation in children (15), and pain in thromboangiitis obliterans (16).2.1.1 head and face the use of acupuncture for treating chronic pain of the head and face has been studied extensively. for tension headache, migraine and other kinds of headache due to a variety of causes, acupuncture has performed favourably in trials comparing it with standard therapy, sham acupuncture, or mock transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens) (17-27). the results suggest that acupuncture could play a significant role in treating such conditions. chronic facial pain, including craniomandibular disorders of muscular origin, also responds well to acupuncture treatments (28-31). the effect of acupuncture is comparable with that of stomatognathic treatments for temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction. acupuncture may be useful as complementary therapy for this condition, as the two treatments probably have a different basis of action (2, 32).2.1.2 locomotor system chronically painful conditions of the locomotor system accompanied by restricted movements of the joints are often treated with acupuncture if surgical intervention is not necessary. acupuncture not only alleviates pain, it also reduces muscle spasm, thereby increasing mobility. joint damage often results from muscle malfunction, and many patients complain of arthralgia before any 9 acupuncture: review and analysis of controlled clinical trials changes are demonstrable by x-ray. in these cases, acupuncture may bring about a permanent cure. controlled studies on common diseases and conditions in this category have been reported by different authors, with favourable results for acupuncture treatments compared with standard therapy, delayed-treatment controls, control needling, mock tens, or other sham acupuncture techniques. the conditions concerned include cervical spondylitis or neck pain due to other causes (33-37), periarthritis of the shoulder (38, 39) fibromyalgia (40), fasciitis (41), epicondylitis (tennis elbow) (42-44), low back pain (45-49), sciatica (50-53), osteoarthritis with knee pain (54-56), and radicular and pseudoradicular pain syndromes (57). in some reports, comparison was made between standard care and acupuncture as an adjunct to standard care. the conclusion from one such randomized controlled trial was that acupuncture is an effective and judicious adjunct to conventional care for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee (58). rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease with extra-articular manifestations in most patients. in this disease, dysfunction of the immune system plays a major role, which explains the extra-articular and articular features. acupuncture is beneficial in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (4-6). while acupuncture may not improve the damage that has been done to the joints, successful pain relief has been verified in the majority of controlled studies (58). the action of acupuncture on inflammation and the dysfunctional immune system is also beneficial (5, 59).", "25263_5": "2.1.3 gout in a randomized controlled trial, blood-pricking acupuncture was compared with conventional medication (allopurinol). the acupuncture group showed greater improvement than the allopurinol group. in addition, a similar reduction of uric acid levels in the blood and urine of both groups was noted (60). plum-blossom needling (acupuncture using plum-blossom needles), together with cupping (the application to the skin of cups which are then depressurized), has been recommended for treating gouty arthritis (61).2.1.4 biliary and renal colic acupuncture is suitable for treating acute pain, provided the relief of pain will not mask the correct diagnosis, for which other treatments may be needed. biliary and renal colic are two conditions for which acupuncture can be used not only as an analgesic but also as an antispasmodic. in controlled studies on biliary colic (62-64) and renal colic (7, 65, 66), acupuncture appears to have advantages over conventional drug treatments (such as intramuscular injection of atropine, pethidine, anisodamine (a chinese medicine structurally related to atropine, isolated from anisodus tanguticus), bucinnazine (also known as bucinperazine) or a metamizole-camylofin combination). it provides a better analgesic effect in a shorter time, without side-effects. in addition, acupuncture is effective for relieving abdominal colic, whether it occurs in acute gastroenteritis or is due to gastrointestinal spasm (67).2. review of clinical trial reports2.1.5 traumatic or postoperative pain for traumas such as sprains, acupuncture is not only useful for relieving pain without the risk of drug dependence, but may also hasten recovery by improving local circulation (68-70). acupuncture analgesia to relieve postoperative pain is well recognized and has been confirmed in controlled studies (71-76). the first successful operation under acupuncture analgesia was a tonsillectomy. this was, in fact, inspired by the success of acupuncture in relieving post-tonsillectomy pain. post-tonsillectomy acupuncture was re-evaluated in a controlled study in 1990, which not only showed prompt alleviation of throat pain, but also reduction in salivation and promotion of healing in the operative wound (76).2.1.6 dentistry acupuncture has been widely used in dentistry. there are reports of randomized controlled trials on the analgesic effect of acupuncture for postoperative pain from various dental procedures, including tooth extraction (77-78), pulp devitalization (79), and acute apical periodontitis (80). according to a systematic review of papers on the use of acupuncture in dentistry published between 1966 and 1996, 11 out of 15 randomized controlled studies with blind controls, appropriate statistics and sufficient follow-up showed standard acupuncture to be more effective than a placebo or sham acupuncture. it was therefore concluded that acupuncture should be considered a reasonable alternative or supplement to current dental practice as an analgesic (81). its use in the treatment of temporomandibular dysfunction was also supported in these studies.2.1.7 childbirth in childbirth, acupuncture analgesia is useful for relieving labour pain and can significantly reduce the duration of labour (82). in the case of weakened uterine contractions, acupuncture increases the activity of the uterus. episiotomy and subsequent suturing of the perineum can also be carried out with acupuncture analgesia. in addition, the avoidance of narcotics is advantageous for newborn infants.2.1.8 surgery acupuncture analgesia has the following advantages in surgical operations. it is a very safe procedure compared with drug anaesthesia; no death has ever been reported from acupuncture analgesia. there is no adverse effect on physiological functions, whereas general anaesthesia often interferes with respiration and blood pressure, for example. there are fewer of the postoperative complications that sometimes occur after general anaesthesia, such as nausea, urinary retention, constipation, and respiratory infections. the patient remains conscious and able to talk with the medical team during the operation so that injury of the facial and recurrent laryngeal nerve can be avoided. however, remaining conscious may be a disadvantage if the patient cannot tolerate the emotional stress of the procedure. acupuncture: review and analysis of controlled clinical trials while the benefits of acupuncture analgesia are many, the disadvantages must also be considered. the use of acupuncture is more time-consuming and in many cases may fail to bring about complete analgesia. it is often not suitable for abdominal surgery because suppression of visceral pain and muscle relaxation may be inadequate. it is not suitable in children because few children will tolerate the needling and keep still during major surgery. also, the surgeon must be quick and deft, so that the operation can be finished before the patient develops tolerance to the needling.", "25263_6": " in conclusion, acupuncture analgesia as an anaesthetic for surgical procedures is indicated in selected patients who show a good response to needling in the preoperative trial, particularly when they may be a poor surgical risk under conventional general anaesthesia. the use of adjuvant drugs to potentiate the effect of the acupuncture treatment is preferred. acupuncture can also be used in combination with general anaesthesia to reduce the dosage of anaesthetic agents (83).2.2 infections acupuncture has been reported to be effective for treating acute bacillary dysentery (8-10). its effect is comparable with that of conventional medicines such as furazolidone, but the use of acupuncture in the first line of defence against this disease is not practicable  daily performance of needling procedures is much more complicated than administering oral drug therapy. however, when no antidysenteric agent is available or the patient is allergic to antidysenteric agents, acupuncture may occasionally be used. the results of research on the effects of acupuncture treatments that stimulate the immune system suggest that acupuncture may be of use in conjunction with other medical therapies for treating infections (84). the effect of acupuncture on the immune system has been tested in hepatitis b virus carriers. in a comparative study, acupuncture-moxibustion is apparently superior to herbal medications in producing hepatitis b e core antibodies and reducing hepatitis b surface antigen (85). for epidemic haemorrhagic fever, compared with steroid and supportive treatments, moxibustion shortened the period of oliguria and promoted the reduction of kidney swelling (86). acupuncture may be useful in treating pertussis (whooping cough), by relieving cough as well as promoting a cure (87).2.3 neurological disorders in the neurological field, headaches, migraines and neuralgia are the common painful conditions treated with acupuncture. strokes and their sequelae are another major indication for acupuncture. early treatment of paresis after stroke has proved highly effective. because improvement in the effects of stroke also occurs naturally, there has been some doubt about the contribution of acupuncture. in recent years, however, a number of controlled clinical evaluations have been undertaken in stroke2. review of clinical trial reports patients. for example, in randomized controlled studies, acupuncture treatment of hemiplegia due to cerebral infarction gave better results than conventional medication (88-93) and physiotherapy (94, 95). there were also beneficial effects when acupuncture was used as a complement to rehabilitation (96-98). in one study, patients with ischaemic cerebrovascular disease treated with acupuncture were compared with patients treated with conventional drugs. nerve function, as evaluated by _ electroencephalographic map and somatosensory evoked potential, showed a much more marked improvement in the patients treated with acupuncture (89). this has been further confirmed by experimental studies. in the laboratory, a rat model of reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion was used. the somatosensory evoked potential recorded before and after the occlusion showed that electric acupuncture markedly promoted the recovery of the amplitude of the p1-n1 wave (to 58.6% in the electric acupuncture group in contrast to 25.5% in the control group after 7 days) (93). in addition, recent clinical studies suggest that the effectiveness of acupuncture therapy can be further promoted by using temporal acupuncture (99, 100). comparative studies have shown acupuncture treatments to be as effective for treating hemiplegia due to cerebral haemorrhage as for that due to cerebral infarction. since early treatment with physiotherapy is unsatisfactory, it is advisable to use acupuncture as the primary treatment. even in hemiplegia of long duration, remarkable improvements can often be achieved. hemiplegia due to other causes, such as brain surgery, can also be improved by acupuncture (101). aphasia caused by acute cerebrovascular disorders can also be treated with acupuncture (102). although acupuncture is effective for many painful conditions, there are only a few reports on post-herpetic neuralgia. two of them were based on randomized clinical trials and provided completely opposite results (103, 104). evaluation of acupuncture in the treatment of this painful condition therefore awaits further study. peripheral nervous disorders are often treated with acupuncture. for example, good effects for bells palsy have been reported in randomized controlled trials (105, 106). facial spasm is another peripheral nervous disorder for which acupuncture treatment may be indicated. for this condition it has been shown that wrist-ankle acupuncture is significantly better than traditional body acupuncture (107).", "25263_7": " coma is a serious condition that can hardly be cured by acupuncture alone, but in a comparative study of two groups of patients with similar levels of coma, a significantly greater number of patients in the acupuncture group had a 50% or greater neurological recovery than those in the control group. this suggests that it is reasonable to incorporate acupuncture along with other therapeutic and supportive measures in the treatment of the comatose patient (108). insomnia can also be treated successfully with acupuncture. in randomized control trials, both auricular acupressure and auricular acupuncture had a hypnotic effect (109, 110). acupuncture: review and analysis of controlled clinical trials2.4 respiratory disorders acupuncture is often used in treating respiratory disorders. allergic rhinitis is one of the major indications. in controlled studies, it has been shown that acupuncture is more effective than antihistamine drugs in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (111-115). acupunctures lack of side-effects is a distinct advantage in treating this condition; however, its protective effect against allergen-provoked rhinitis has not been verified (116). the acute symptoms of tonsillitis can be effectively relieved with acupuncture (117). since there is no information about the incidence of complications secondary to tonsillitis treated with acupuncture, in clinical practice antibiotic therapy should still be considered the treatment of choice for acute tonsillitis. for sore throats from other causes, acupuncture treatment provides definite benefits, in contrast to a placebo and acupuncture refusal (118). although there are conflicting results from controlled trials in treating bronchial asthma with acupuncture, the majority of the reports suggest that acupuncture is effective (119-123) and that the effect is related to the points used (122). while bronchial asthma is not cured by acupuncture, it may be substantially relieved, at least for short periods of time. the success rates quoted in the literature are 60-70%. acupuncture has a limited role in treating acute asthmatic attacks since it is a weak bronchodilator, but it may serve as a prophylactic measure over the long term. controlled trials have shown that acupuncture brings about modest improvement in objective parameters, with significant subjective improvement (124). prospective randomized single-blind studies of the effects of real and sham acupuncture on exercise-induced and metacholine-induced asthma revealed that real acupuncture provided better protection than did sham acupuncture (119), but it failed to modulate the bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine (125). corticosteroid-dependent bronchial asthma may respond better to acupuncture treatment than other types: the required dosage of corticosteroids gradually decreases during the first weeks of acupuncture treatment (126). acupuncture may also provide symptomatic improvement in the late stages of bronchial asthma, where there are complications of disabling breathlessness due to impaired lung function (127).2.5 digestive disorders epigastric pain is a common symptom in diseases of the stomach, including peptic ulcer, acute and chronic gastritis, and gastric spasm. acupuncture provides satisfactory relief of epigastric painsignificantly better than injections of anisodamine or morphine plus atropine, as shown in randomized controlled trials (128, 129). for gastrointestinal spasm, acupuncture is also superior to injections of atropine (130), and for gastrokinetic disturbances, the effectiveness of acupuncture is comparable with that of conventional medicine (domperidone) (131). another common symptom of digestive disorders is nausea and vomiting. this can be due to a disordered function of the stomach, but it is more often a symptom or sign of generalized disorders. morning sickness, postoperative vomiting, and nausea and vomiting related to chemotherapy are frequently2. review of clinical trial reports encountered clinically. in all these conditions, acupuncture at point niguan (pc6) seems to have a specific antiemetic effect. a recent systematic review of trials using acupuncture for antiemesis showed that 11 of 12 randomized placebo- controlled trials, involving nearly 2000 patients, supported this effect. the reviewed papers showed consistent results across different investigators, different groups of patients, and different forms of acupuncture stimulation (132). irritable colon syndrome and chronic ulcerative colitis are often difficult to treat with conventional medication. for these diseases, acupuncture may serve as a complementary or alternative therapeutic measure (133, 134). because of its analgesic effect, acupuncture can be used in endoscopic examinations, e.g. in colonoscopy. it has been reported that the effect of acupuncture to relieve pain and discomfort during the examination is comparable with that of scopolamine or pethidine with fewer side-effects (135, 136).", "25263_8": " there has been extensive research on the effect of acupuncture on the digestive system, with extensive data showing its influence on the physiology of the gastrointestinal tract, including acid secretion, motility, neurohormonal changes and changes in sensory thresholds. many of the neuroanatomic pathways of these effects have been identified in animal models (137). acupuncture shows good analgesic and antispasmodic effects on the biliary tract and, as indicated previously, can be recommended for treatment of biliary colic (62-64). it also has a cholagogic action, which has been demonstrated in experimental studies. in the treatment of biliary colic due to gallstones, acupuncture is not only effective for relieving the colicky pain, but is also useful for expelling the stones. satisfactory results were reported when electric acupuncture was used in combination with oral administration of magnesium sulfate (138). acupuncture treatment is also worth trying for chronic cholecystitis, even if there is acute exacerbation (139).2.6 blood disorders among various blood disorders, leukopenia is the most suitable for acupuncture treatment. in controlled studies, acupuncture has been shown to be more effective than batilol and/or cysteine phenylacetate in the treatment of leukopenia due to chemotherapy (140-142) or benzene intoxication (143, 144).2.7 urogenital disorders urinary retention due to functional disorders, with no organic obstruction, is often treated with acupuncture. for postpartum or postoperative urinary retention, successful micturition usually occurs immediately after one session of needling (66, 145). it is probably for this reason that controlled studies on this subject have been neglected. however, there has been a report of a randomized controlled trial on traumatic retention of urine, a condition more complicated than postpartum or postoperative retention. in this trial, the efficacy of 15 acupuncture: review and analysis of controlled clinical trials acupuncture was remarkably superior to that of intramuscular injection of neostigmine bromide(146). acupuncture is not only useful for relieving renal colic, but also for expelling urinary stones (if they are not too large), because it dilates the ureter. satisfactory results have been obtained in comparisons with conventional medication (7), but it is better to use acupuncture as a complementary measure in conjunction with medication or lithotripsy. sexual disorders are often treated with acupuncture, but conclusive results based on methodologically sound clinical studies are still lacking. acupuncture was shown to be more effective than placebo in the treatment of non-organic male sexual dysfunction, but the improvement was not statistically significant (147). in another randomized controlled trial, acupuncture had a better effect than the control in the treatment of defective ejaculation (no ejaculation during intercourse) (148). acupuncture may also be helpful to patients with chronic prostatitis. as shown in a randomized controlled trial, acupuncture was superior to oral sulfamethoxazole in relieving symptoms and improving sexual function (149). in women, it has been shown that acupuncture can lower urethral pressure and relieve urethral syndrome (150, 151). acupuncture has also been successfully used as a prophylaxis against recurrent lower urinary tract infections (152).2.8 gynaecological and obstetric disorders primary dysmenorrhoea, a painful condition, is one of the major indications for acupuncture in the field of gynaecological disorders. the beneficial effect of acupuncture on this condition has been repeatedly reported in controlled trials (153, 154). acupuncture relieves pain and also regulates the motility of the uterus to facilitate menstrual discharge and further alleviate the pain. premenstrual syndrome is characterized by cyclical mood changes and is a common condition in women of fertile age. acupuncture seems to be helpful to patients with this syndrome. in a controlled study, the majority of the patients receiving acupuncture gained relief from symptoms and no recurrence in the six- month follow-up (155). although acupuncture was reported to be effective in the treatment of female anovular infertility (156), no methodologically sound, controlled trials have been reported. however, the mechanism of acupuncture in regulating abnormal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis has been demonstrated in experimental studies. the data suggest that electric acupuncture with relative specificity of acupuncture points could influence some genetic expression in the brain, thereby normalizing the secretion of certain hormones, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone and estradiol (157). acupuncture is also worth trying in the treatment of female infertility due to inflammatory obstruction of the fallopian tubes, where it seems to be superior to conventional therapy with intrauterine injection of gentamicin, chymotrypsin and dexamethasone (158).", "25263_9": " acupuncture in pregnant women should be undertaken with care. needling at some points (namely, on the abdomen and lumbosacral region), as well as strong2. review of clinical trial reports stimulation of certain distant points, such as hgi (li4), sanyinjiao (sp6) and zhiyin (bl67), may cause miscarriage. however, this action is useful if induction of labour is desired, such as in prolonged pregnancy; the effect is comparable with that of oxytocin by intravenous drip (159-161). in early pregnancy, acupuncture at the upper limb points can be used for the prevention and treatment of morning sickness. the efficacy of acupressure at neiguan (pc6) has been reported repeatedly in placebo-controlled studies (13, 162, 163). in order to prevent miscarriage induced by needling, acupressure is recommended for the treatment of morning sickness. various methods of acupuncture, such as pressure at ear points and moxibustion at zhiyin (bl67) or zulingi (gb41), have been used to correct abnormal fetal position during the last three months of pregnancy. the success rates in groups treated with these methods were much higher than the occurrence of spontaneous version or in groups treated with knee-chest position or moxibustion at non-classical points (164-167). acupuncture stimulates milk secretion after childbirth and can be used to treat deficient lactation due to mental lability or depression. it has been observed that acupuncture elevates the blood prolactin level in women with deficient milk secretion after childbirth; in the majority of cases, lactation starts as the blood prolactin level increases (168). the clinical use of acupuncture to promote lactation has also been demonstrated in a randomized controlled study (169).2.9 cardiovascular disorders acupuncture is suitable for treating primary hypotension (170, 171) and early essential hypertension (172-176). it has been reported that the influence of acupuncture on hypertension might be related to its regulatory effect on the level of serum nitrogen monoxide (177). for primary hypotension, acupuncture seems to be more effective than general tonics. for mild and moderate essential hypertension, the hypotensive effect of acupuncture is much more potent than that of placebos and is comparable with that of certain conventional hypotensive agents. in addition, acupuncture is often effective for relieving subjective symptoms, and it has no side-effects. encouraging results have been reported for a number of controlled studies on the treatment of heart disease with acupuncture, particularly in psychosomatic heart disorders, such as cardiac neurosis (178). in coronary heart disease, acupuncture has been shown by various authors to be effective in relieving angina pectoris. its beneficial influence has been demonstrated during coronary arteriography. cardiological, neurophysiological and psychological observations, made in mutually independent studies, indicated that acupuncture improved the working capacity of the heart in patients with angina pectoris and activated autoregulatory cardiovascular mechanisms in healthy persons (179). in controlled studies, acupuncture has provided significantly greater improvement in symptoms and cardiac work capacity than either placebo (180-182) or conventional medication, such as glyceryl trinitrate (183, 184). dilation of the coronary artery during acupuncture has been shown to be comparable with that observed during intracatheter injection of isosorbide dinitrate (185). in addition, acupuncture has a beneficial effect on the left ventricular function of patients 17 acupuncture: review and analysis of controlled clinical trials with coronary heart disease, and is also more effective than nifedipine and isosorbide dinitrate (186). neiguan (pc6) is the point most commonly used for treating cardiac disorders. the beneficial effect of acupuncture at this point has been demonstrated by serial equilibrium radionuclide angiography (187). acupuncture also produces haemorrheological improvement (188). in order to avoid unexpected accidents, however, special attention should be paid to the treatment of heart disease. acupuncturists must be able to differentiate between angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction.2.10 psychiatric disorders and mental disturbances acupuncture is being increasingly used in psychiatric disorders. the effect of acupuncture on depression (including depressive neurosis and depression following stroke) has been documented repeatedly in controlled studies (189- 194). acupuncture is comparable with amitriptyline in the treatment of depression but has fewer side-effects. in addition, acupuncture has been found to be more effective in depressive patients with decreased excretion of 3-methyl-4- hydroxy-phenylglycol (the principal metabolite of the central neurotransmitter norepinephrine), while amitriptyline is more effective for those with inhibition in the dexamethasone suppression test (192). this suggests that these two therapies work through different mechanisms. there have also been reports that, in controlled trials of schizophrenia treatment, acupuncture might have a better effect than chlorpromazine (194, 195).", "25263_10": " acupuncture (auricular acupressure) is much more effective than psychotherapy in the treatment of competition stress syndrome, and is worth further study (196). the possible use of auricular acupuncture as a treatment for opium dependence was first noted in 1973 (197). it was found that some of the patients whose postoperative pain was relieved by acupuncture were hiding a dependence on opium. in 1979, a study carried out jointly in hong kong and london showed that endorphin concentrations were raised by acupuncture in heroin-dependent persons, resulting in successful suppression of withdrawal symptoms. since then, acupuncture has been used to treat dependence on a variety of substances. many substance-abuse programmes use acupuncture as an adjunct to conventional treatment (198). most of the reports are anecdotal, and while there have been several controlled trials (199-202), the findings have not been consistent. this entire field of research is still at an early stage, holding some promise, but requiring larger-scale and more demanding research studies (198). acupuncture treatment has also been used in patients who wish to give up smoking. the conclusions of different researchers are conflicting, however. some favour acupuncture, while others dismiss its value (203-207). probably the most convincing results are from randomized controlled trials of passive abstinence, with no suggestion or motivation to stop smoking. the patients were told they would receive acupuncture for other purposes, and they were not asked to stop smoking. a comparison of the effects of auricular acupuncture and body acupuncture was made: 70% of the auricular-acupuncture patients and 11% of those receiving body acupuncture either abstained totally from smoking or reduced the amount of consumption by half. in addition, 72% of the auricular-2. review of clinical trial reports acupuncture patients experienced disgust at the taste of tobacco (204). however, in contrast, a meta-analysis of seven reports carefully selected from 16 controlled studies of smoking cessation indicated that acupuncture did not have any greater effect than the placebo (208). acupuncture has also been reported to be useful for treating alcohol recidivism. in placebo-controlled trials (with acupuncture at nonspecific points as the control), the patients in the treatment group expressed less need for alcohol than did the control patients. patients in the treatment group also had fewer drinking episodes and admissions to a detoxification centre (209-211). it is interesting to note that in an experimental study on healthy volunteers, acupuncture diminished clinical alcohol intoxication by increasing the alcohol level in expired air and decreasing blood alcohol levels (212).2.11 paediatric disorders diarrhoea in infants and young children is still a daunting problem worldwide, particularly in developing countries. acupuncture seems to be worth using, at least as an adjunct to conventional treatments, because it regulates intestinal function and enhances immune response without causing an imbalance in the intestinal flora as do antibiotics (213, 214). convulsions due to high fever are not infrequently encountered in infants and young children. in a controlled clinical trial, convulsions stopped two minutes after needling was started, a result superior to that of intramuscular phenobarbital injection (215). although the specific treatment for pertussis is antimicrobials, the paroxysmal coughing is usually very distressing. there has been a report that acupuncture could hasten the cure as well as relieving the cough (87). there are two controlled studies indicating that acupuncture may be of some help in the treatment of tourette syndrome in children (216, 217).2.12 disorders of the sense organs deaf-mute children were once extensively treated with acupuncture in china, but no methodologically sound reports have ever shown that acupuncture therapy had any real effectiveness. a recent randomized controlled clinical trial on sudden-onset deafness in adults favoured acupuncture treatment (218). acupuncture might be useful in the treatment of mnire disease for relieving symptoms and also for reducing the frequency of attacks. it seems to be more effective than conventional drug therapy (betahistine, nicotinic acid and vitamin bo) (219). tinnitus is often difficult to treat. traditionally acupunture has been believed to be effective for treating tinnitus, but only two randomized controlled clinical trials are available  with inconsistent results (220, 221). 20 acupuncture: review and analysis of controlled clinical trials unexplained earache that is neither primary (due to ear disease) nor secondary (as referred pain), is often regarded as a manifestation of psychogenic disturbances. acupuncture has been shown to be effective in this kind of earache in a placebo-controlled trial (222).", "25263_11": " acupuncture might be helpful in the treatment of simple epistaxis unassociated with generalized or local disease, but only one report of a randomized controlled clinical trial is available. this report indicates that auricular acupuncture provides a more satisfactory effect than conventional haemostatic medication (223).2.13 skin diseases in some countries, many skin diseases are customarily treated with acupuncture, but very few controlled studies have been published. in a randomized controlled clinical trial on chloasma, acupuncture had a significantly better effect than vitamins c and e (224). some evidence favouring acupuncture treatment of herpes zoster (human (alpha) herpesvirus 3) has been reported. in a randomized controlled trial, laser acupuncture relieved pain and promoted formation of scar tissue much more quickly than treatment with polyinosinic acid (225). acupuncture is known to have an antipruritic effect. this has been shown experimentally in volunteers, suggesting that acupuncture could be used in clinical conditions associated with pruritus (226). acupuncture with dermal needles (seven-star or plum-blossom needles) has traditionally been used in the treatment of neurodermatitis, but confirmation of its effect in a controlled clinical trial was only recently reported (227). for the treatment of acne vulgaris, acupuncture, particularly ear acupuncture, is worth recommending if the reported therapeutic effects can be further proved (228, 229).2.14 cancers no controlled study has been reported on the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of cancer itself. however, acupuncture still has uses in cancer treatments. one is to relieve cancer pain, and the other is to control the adverse reactions to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. for cancer pain, it has been reported that acupuncture provided an immediate analgesic effect similar to that of codeine and pethidine, with a more marked effect after use for two months (230). the effect was comparable with that achieved using the analgesic steps recommended by who (231). for radiotherapy and chemotherapy, acupuncture can greatly lessen the adverse reactions in the digestive and nervous systems, as well as providing protection against damage to haematopoiesis (232-237).2. review of clinical trial reports2.15 other reports obesity and hyperlipaemia are becoming increasingly important medical issues. if acupuncture could help in reducing body weight and blood lipids, its clinical use could be greatly expanded. quite a number of reports on this effect have been published, but unfortunately, almost none of them is methodologically sound. there are only two preliminary reports of randomized controlled clinical trials that can be cited here (238, 239), although criticism of the study design cannot be totally avoided. acupuncture may be of benefit to patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. its efficacy has been shown to be superior to that of placebos and comparable with that of tolbutamide (240, 241). anisodamine is effective in treating excessive salivation induced by drugs (usually antipsychotics), but acupuncture seems to be more effective (242). there are also reports on the treatment of sjogren syndrome (sicca syndrome) (243), raynaud syndrome (244), stein-leventhal syndrome (polycystic ovary syndrome) (244), and tietze syndrome (costochondritis) (245), which indicate beneficial effects from acupuncture treatment. since these reports have appeared only in individual papers, confirmation by further study is necessary. 21 22 acupuncture: review and analysis of

college of radiation oncology (acro) appreciates the opportunity to offer its comments to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) on the proposed rule for the cy 2021 physician fee schedule (cms-1734-p).'! acro represents radiation oncologists in the socioeconomic and political arenas. with a current membership of approximately 1,200, acro is dedicated to fostering radiation oncology education and science; improving patient care services; studying the socioeconomic aspects of the practice of radiation oncology; and encouraging education in radiation oncology. acro appreciates this opportunity to comment on the proposed regulations. this letter will comment on the following issues: impact of the pfs rule on office-based specialists critical need for stability for office-based specialists support for treatment delivery g-codes under the pfs proton beam treatment delivery codes (cpt codes 77520, 77522, 77523, and 77525) updates to clinical labor data new cpt code 99072i. impact of the pfs rule on office-based specialists in the cy 2020 pfs final rule, cms finalized its proposal to increase payments starting in 2021 for office & outpatient e&m services (cpts 99202-99215) in-line with recommendations from the american medical association (ama) relative value scale update committee (ruc). cms also finalized its proposal to introduce a new add-on code (hcpcs gpc1x) for complex care associated 1 federal register, 85 fr 48772 (august 12, 2020) american college of radiation oncology - 2001 6\" ave, suite 2700, seattle, wa 98121 206-956-3650 - www.acro.org with e&m services and adjusted e&m-like services codes to maintain relativity to new and existing e&m services. in large part due to these changes the 2021 pfs proposed rule would implement, 16 specialties would see a decrease of 7 percent or more in payments, while another 13 specialties could see an increase of 7 percent or more, resulting in one of the most significant redistributions of medicare physician payments ever implemented by cms and up to 10% cuts to radiation oncology services. these cuts also would threaten patient access to office-based cancer care during a pandemic and a time in which every effort should be made to keep vulnerable patients out of the hospital. cumulative impact of pfs redistributions since 2006 unfortunately, this redistribution of medicare physician payments away from certain office-based specialists is not a new occurrence. many of these office-based specialists, particularly cardiology, pathology, physical therapy, radiation oncology, radiology, and surgery, among others, have seen significant redistributions under the pfs away from their services since 2006 with such redistributions growing over time. the chart below shows the results of pfs impact tables since 2006 with specialties highlighted that have had significant changes over the last 14 years.? these redistributions away from office-based specialties have amounted to approximately $10 billion. cumulative change in medicare payments for select specialties since 2006 family practice, 43% endocrinology, 32% internal medicine, 24% psychiatry, 24% podiatry, 18% radiationoncology, -28% ~40% nterventional radiology, -32% radiology, -41% diagnostic testing facility, -64%6 2 health management associates. hma analysis of 2006-2021 medicare physician fee schedule proposed and final rule impact tables. american college of radiation oncology - 2001 6\" ave, suite 2700, seattle, wa 98121 206-956-3650 - www.acro.org these cumulative changes derive in large part from the outmoded budget neutrality provisions under section 1848 of the social security act which aims to keep spending within the physician fee schedule budget neutral to itself. as history has shown, however, this siloed, anachronistic approach to medicare policy ignores the effects of the volatility and sustained cuts to office-based specialists stemming from the policy. when office-based specialists are forced to close their centers and such care moves to higher cost sites-of-service, budget neutrality is not the outcome. the outcome is higher costs to the medicare program and its beneficiaries, upheaval to patients healthcare continuum, and an overall diminution in patient access. this situation is only exacerbated by the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. at atime when cms has stated that treatment for most cancers should not be postponed, such proposed cuts are simply unconscionable.*", "26570_1": " recommendation: acro urges in the strongest possible terms that cms waive budget neutrality under the pfs for 2021 and spare vulnerable patients  and the office-based specialists who treat them  from huge cuts during a pandemic. in addition, acro urges cms to take steps to address more fundamental issues with the so-called budget neutrality provision in the physician fee schedule. put simply, budget neutrality is a misnomer, which often results in reduced medicare beneficiary access to office-based specialists and can force such patients to receive necessary care at a higher cost site of service. while we realize that fundamental changes to budget neutrality may require congressional intervention to allow for long-term reform, we urge the agency to begin working now with stakeholders on options to address this issue.ii. critical need for stability for office-based specialties in the 2021 pfs proposed rule, cms indicates the age of the data currently used for indirect practice expenses in the cms database (our current system for setting pe rvus relies in part on data collected in the physician practice information survey (ppis), which was administered by the ama in cy 2007 and 2008.). the agency also notes it is interested in potentially refining the pe methodology and updating the data used to make payments under the pfs .... as soon as practicable. approaches to updating the indirect practice expense data  and potentially the practice expense data overall  appear to break down along three general approaches: e use of opps data. this approach appears to be favored by the rand corporation. in a 2018 report to cms, rand describes how macro-level hospital charge data could be used to set overall practice expenses under the physician fee schedule. while such an approach could result in better price transparency and stability for office-based stakeholders, a key consideration would be setting the percent of opps rates per specialty in a way that promoted the viability and stability of services in the office setting. for example, freestanding radiation oncology centers likely incur practice expenses approaching 100% of a hospital outpatient departments costs and other office-based specialties similarly use the same high-cost supplies as a hospital. e use of ama data. this approach appears to be favored by the ama and would involve the use of micro-level physician data compiled through a physician survey. the previous 2007 / 2008 ama survey resulted in drastic cuts to office-based specialties (e.g. cardiology [-13%], interventional radiology [-10%], radiation oncology [-5%]) when incorporated in the 2009 physician fee schedule. moreover, its worth noting that these data pulled from 3 https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-elective-surgery-rec jations.odf american college of radiation oncology - 2001 6\" ave, suite 2700, seattle, wa 98121 206-956-3650 - www.acro.org the 2009 physician fee schedule impact table likely masked an even greater negative impact on office-based specialties given that the medicare impact tables include both office- based (i.e. their technical and professional reimbursement) and hospital-based physicians(i.e. just their professional reimbursement). in addition, any new indirect practice expense data would be fed into cms complicated 19 step practice expense methodology ultimately making any new rate-setting for office-based specialties based on such data a mystery beyond its ultimate impact to a given office-based specialty. e use of market data. this approach, among others, is contemplated by cms in the 2021 pfs proposed rule and would involve the use of market-based information similar to the market research conducted to update equipment and supply data through rulemaking in 2018 for the 2019 physician fee schedule. cms approach in 2018 to derive direct practice expense data for supplies and equipment was grounded in the agencys use of a contractor, strategygen, to arrive at such pricing. unfortunately, this approach  sometimes referred to as a secret shopper methodology  suffers from a lack of transparency on exactly what kind of invoice data (e.g. manufacturer(s), setting, year, aggregation methodology) ultimately was used to arrive at the equipment and supply pricing currently included in the cms database. we believe there are two key principles to which cms must adhere before choosing any new methodology to update the pfs practice expense methodology. first, cms must be transparent and provide stakeholders the tools to understand how any proposed approach to update the pfs practice expense methodology will impact reimbursement before implementing a new pe methodology. this principle is critical as many office-based specialists focus on discrete service lines. while this means that office-based specialists often can realize optimal patient outcomes as centers of excellence, they are much more susceptible to reimbursement volatility than, for example, hospitals, which often provide a broad array of services.", "26570_2": " the second principle, which builds off the first principle, is that cms must publicly certify that any new agency action that results in more than a 1 percent reduction to a given office- based specialty will not result in a migration of services to a higher cost site-of-service. for years, office-based specialists have suffered under significant payment volatility under the pfs and have been forced to make perennial entreaties to the agency and congress that cuts to office-based specialists will cause center closures, a reduction in patient access, and likely increases to the medicare program due to migration of services to other settings. in some cases, the agency and congress have responded  after the fact  to mitigate or reverse proposed cuts. too often, however, actual cuts, or the simple volatility caused by proposed cuts, have caused the very center closures and migration of services acro profoundly hopes to avoid in the future. as noted in a 2019 american medical association (ama) report, 2016 was the first year in which less than half of practicing physicians (47.1 percent) had an ownership stake in their practice and 2018 marked the first year in which there were fewer physician owners (45.9 percent) than employees (47.4 percent). the report also noted that between 2012 and 2018 the percentage of physicians in practices with 10 or fewer physicians dropped from 61.4 percent to 56.5 percent with much of that change driven by a shift away from solo practice.* 4 american medical association, policy research perspectives updated data on physician practice arrangements: for 4 american college of radiation oncology - 2001 6\" ave, suite 2700, seattle, wa 98121 206-956-3650 - www.acro.org the covid-19 pandemic only has accelerated these trends. an april 2020 survey by the medical group management association (mgma) found that a significant number of medical practices have already been forced to layoff and furlough staff in response to the financial challenges of covid-19. a more recent survey completed by the physicians foundation completed in august 2020, found: e 8% of respondents have closed their practices, with more than three-quarters of this group being specialists, equating to as many as 16,000 practices nationally based on sk&a market research data. e another 4% said they plan to close their practices within 12 months as a result of covid-19.7 recommendation: acro urges that any new approach by cms to update the practice expense methodology be transparent and provide stakeholders the tools to understand  before implementation  how such changes will impact stakeholder reimbursement. second, acro urges that any new significant regulatory action that by cms that results in more than a 1 percent reduction to an office-based specialty under the physician fee schedule must be accompanied by a public certification by the agency, after consultation with affected specialties and other stakeholders, that such action will not cause a migration of services to a higher cost site-of-service.il. support for treatment delivery g-codes under the pfs for several years, acro has commented on the need for payment stability for radiation oncology services within the physician fee schedule. for cy 2015, the ama cpt revised the code set certain radiation therapy treatment and imaging codes. however, cms delayed implementation of the new code set citing concerns that substantial work needed to be done to assure the new valuations for these codes accurately reflect the coding changes. instead, cms maintained inputs at cy 2014 levels by creating g-codes to allow practitioners to continue to report services to cms in cy 2015 as they did in cy 2014 and for payments to be made in the same way. these g-codes are as follows: g6001, g6002, g6003, g6004, g6005, g6006, g6007, g6008, g6009, g6010, g6011, g6012, g6013, g6014, g6015, g6016 and g6017. following the publication of the cy 2015 pfs final rule, the patient access and medicare protection act (pub. l. 114-115, december 28, 2015) was enacted, which included the provision that the code definitions, the work relative value units and the direct inputs for the pe rvus for radiation treatment delivery and related imaging services (identified in 2016 by hcpcs g-codes g6001 through g6015) for the fee schedule established under this subsection for services furnished in 2017 and 2018 shall be the same as such definitions, units, and inputs for such services for the fee schedule established for services furnished in 2016. in cy 2018, congress extended this the first time, fewer physicians are owners than employees, 2019 > medical group management association, covid-19 financial impact on medical practices, 2020  american hospital association, specialist and private practices take severe blow during pandemic, 2020 7 the physicians foundation, 2020 survey of americas physicians: covid-19 impact edition, 2020", "26570_3": " american college of radiation oncology - 2001 6\" ave, suite 2700, seattle, wa 98121 206-956-3650 - www.acro.org freeze in coding descriptions and inputs through cy 2019 as a provision of the bipartisan budget act of 2018. acro is grateful for cms proposal to maintain the current g-codes for certain radiation therapy delivery and imaging services in the interest of payment stability. in light of the covid-19 pandemic, we believe such payment stability is more important than ever for the sector. recommendation: acro strongly supports cms proposal to maintain the current g- code code set for g6001, g6002, g6003, g6004, g6005, g6006, g6007, g6008, g6009, g6010, g6011, g6012, g6013, g6014, g6015, g6016 and g6017.iv. proton beam treatment delivery codes (cpt codes 77520, 77522, 77523, and 77525) in the proposed rule, cms noted that it encountered significant difficulties in reviewing the recommended direct pe inputs for the codes in the proton beam treatment delivery family. these difficulties were largely associated with determining a price for the two new equipment items in the code family, the proton treatment vault (er115) and the proton treatment delivery system (er116). these equipment items had extraordinarily high prices of $19,001,914 and $30,400,000 respectively on the invoices submitted with the code family. by way of comparison, the highest equipment price currently existing in our database for cy 2021 is the srs system, linac (er082) equipment item at $4,233,825. we have concerns that establishing equipment pricing for the proton treatment vault and delivery system at a rate that is so much higher than anything else in our equipment database could distort relativity. as a result, cms is proposing to maintain contractor pricing for cpt codes 77520, 77522, 77523, and 77525 instead of proposing active pricing for these services. while acro does currently support the continuation of carrier pricing, it is also could envision proton pricing of some percentage of opps rates (e.g. 95% of opps payment amount) as cms looks to potentially value pfs pervus using opps rates. while this rate might not adequately cover the practice expense component in some larger facilities, it would allow continued support for other facilities showing significant positive patient outcomes (e.g. md anderson in houston, texas and memorial sloan kettering in nyc, ny). recommendation: in the near term, acro supports the continuation of carrier pricing proton treatment codes 77520, 77522, 77523 and 77525. over the long-run, however, acro would be interested in exploring the use of opps data to set proton pervus in the pfs. acro would request that cms work with stakeholders to ensure that the interaction of such an approach with underlying pfs budget neutrality provisions did not result in the distortion either of appropriate proton rates or either non-proton rates within the pfs.v. updates to clinical labor data in the 2021 pfs proposed rule, cms notes that [s]takeholders have expressed an interest in updating the clinical labor data that we use for direct pe inputs based on current salaries and compensation for the health care workforce. we are soliciting comment regarding how we might update the clinical labor data. historically, we have used data from the bureau of labor statistics american college of radiation oncology - 2001 6\" ave, suite 2700, seattle, wa 98121 206-956-3650 - www.acro.org and are seeking comment to determine if this is the best data source or if there is an alternative ... stakeholders are encouraged to submit feedback as part of their public comments or, if outside the public comment process, via email at pe_price_ input update@cms.hhs.gov . acro has collected clinical labor data and found that the rate per minute used by cms radiation oncology services is significantly undervalued. for example, for the radiation therapist and rn/lpn/mta clinical labor inputs for g6015, acro collected data from a radiation oncology workgroup found that annual salaries (including benefits) for radiation therapists are around $100,000 per year (as opposed to $75,000 in the cms database and $80,000 per year for radiation oncology nurses (as opposed to $55,500 in the cms database). recommendation: we ask that cms continue its efforts to properly value radiation oncology services in the physician office setting, particularly through the acceptance, as appropriate, of industry-provided practice expense data.vi. new cpt code 99072 physicians and other qualified health care professionals (qhps) across the united states have risen to the challenge of caring for their patients throughout the covid-19 pandemic. as a part of the public health emergency (phe), practices have incurred significant costs of maintaining safe offices, particularly in implementing specific infection control measures related to screening patients, purchasing personal protective equipment (ppe), and implementing office redesign measures to ensure social distancing. recognizing that grants and loans were initially provided to physicians to assist with revenue loss during the initial months of the pandemic, and to partially address immediate costs of re-opening, acro requests that new funding and payment assist physicians and qhps for ongoing costs during the phe.", "26570_4": " we understand that the american medical association (ama) has requested that cms immediately consider implementation of relative values and payment (outside of budget neutrality) for cpt code 99072 (additional supplies, materials, and clinical staff time over and above those usually included in an office visit or other non-facility service(s), when performed during a public health emergency as defined by law, due to respiratory-transmitted infectious disease). the ama cpt editorial panel approved the new cpt code 99072 with an effective date of september 8, 2020. recommendation: we ask that cms immediately implement cpt code 99072 to recognize the additional supplies and new staff activities required to comply with providing safe care during the public health emergency. conclusion acros comments on the physician fee schedule regulations seek to ensure ongoing access to high-quality, state-of-the-art radiation oncology services. maintaining patient access is crucial to quality healthcare delivery since most of our patients require services five days a week for many weeks of life-saving therapy. patient accessibility and continuity through a complete course of therapy are key components of the care continuum. we hope our comments highlight our sincere interest in making radiation oncology services cost-effective, fairly reimbursed, and readily

provide comments on the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) proposed rule (cms-1734-p), published on august 17, 2020 in the federal register, regarding proposed policy revisions to the cy 2021 medicare physician fee schedule (pfs). scmr is the international professional society representing physicians, scientists, technologists, and nurses advocating for research, education, and

cardiovascular health through advancement of the field of cardiovascular magnetic resonance. 19 mantua road, mount royal, new jersey, 08061, usa telephone: +1-856-423-8955 e-mail: hg@scmr.org - www.scmr.org 2021 proposed conversion factor scmr urges cms to use its authority under the public health emergency (phe) to waive budget neutrality rules for the purpose of applying the proposed conversion factor for calendar year cy 2021. the proposed cy 2021 medicare pfs conversion factor is $32.26, which represents an almost 11 percent reduction from the cy 2020 conversion factor of $36.09. the drastic 11 percent reduction in the medicare conversion factor is necessitated by proposed additional spending of $10.2 billion, due, in part, to changes in the structure of evaluation and management (e/m) services and related codes. implementation of revised e/m codes and proposed payment increases for e/m services, which indeed were supported under the auspices of the american medical association cpt and ruc processes, should go forward. however, deep reimbursement cuts will result for many medical specialties, including radiology. the proposed -11 percent cut in reimbursement for radiology will be severe especially in this time of pandemic when there is a large decrease in volume of imaging services, and when extra costs are incurred due to revised patient care protocols and necessary purchases of personal protective equipment. the proposed cy 2021 conversion factor will be lower than any annual conversion factor since 1994. cuts of this magnitude are exactly what the enabling legislation (medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015) sought to avoid. additionally, the physician fee schedule updates for years 2020 through 2025 will be o percent. clearly, this is an unsustainable policy change for all medicare part b providers. in recent history, either congress or cms has acted to mitigate negative impacts by phasing in reimbursement cuts over time or reducing the totality of the cuts. if cms chooses not to use its authority to waive budget neutrality during this phe, and if congress fails to act, we urge the agency to consider a phase-in of the proposed cuts. for example, in the 2010 physician fee schedule final rule, cms began using a new survey of practice expenses that resulted in significant redistributions in payment. cms used its regulatory authority to adopt these changes over a transition period. similarly, if budget neutrality requirements are not waived, we ask cms to utilize a similar approach for specialties that are slated to receive cuts due to the e/m restructuring.", "30704_1": " 19 mantua road, mount royal, new jersey, 08061, usa telephone: +1-856-423-8955 e-mail: hg@scmr.org - www.scmr.org finally, given the

submitted via requlations.gov re: cms-1734-p, notice of proposed rulemaking, medicare program; cy 2021 payment policies under the physician fee schedule and other changes to part b payment policies to whom it may concern: the colorado community health network (cchn) is pleased to respond to the above- referenced notice of proposed rulemaking (proposed rule). cchn is the primary care association for colorados 20 federally qualified health centers (fqhcs), which operate 222 clinic sites and serve patients in 62 of colorados 64 counties. fqhcs provide a primary health care home to more than 852,000 people in colorado, including 57,000 medicare enrollees. we write today in support of comments submitted by the national association of community health centers. specifically, we would like to offer our comments on the following issues: e telehealth and audio-only services: in light of the covid-19 pandemic and public health emergency, telehealth is the most important issue for fqhcs involving this nprm. temporary recognition as distant site telehealth providers during the phe has been essential for fqhcs to continue to safeguard their patients health. fqhcs remain hopeful that congress will act to extend telehealth distant site provider status permanently, and our comments on telehealth issues generally are premised on that hope and expectation. we agree with some aspects of cms approach toward telehealth in the proposed rule, especially cms intention to extend its recognition of certain additional services as telehealth services for the duration of calendar year (cy) 2021, while soliciting and collecting additional data as to whether the services should be added permanently. as to cms solicitation of comment regarding audio-only telehealth services, we want to emphasize the critical role these services play for fqhcs, many of whose patients do not have access to adequate internet service or a smart device to facilitate a connection that meets the otherwise-applicable telecommunications system requirements for medicare telehealth. in order for virtual care to remain within the reach of low-income medicare beneficiaries, cms needs to retain these services within the telehealth services umbrella after the phe expires, rather than shifting to providing a lower payment for them as part of the virtual communication services benefit. 600 grant street, suite 800 | denver, co 80203 | p 303.861.5165 | f 303.861.5315 | www.cchn.org addition of principal care management services to fqhc chronic care management codes: cchn is generally supportive of the proposal to add the pcm codes to the g0511 bundle of services and to update the payment to reflect these services. updating the fqhc marketbasket: cchn applauds cms, both for implementing an fqhc-specific market basket adjuster, per section 1834(0)(2)(b) of the ssa; and for taking the initiative to rebase the market basket percentage, effective in 2021, using more recent cost data. as cms noted, 2013 cost data were used to implement the fqhc market basket initially in cy2017. between 2013 and 2017, fqhcs around the country expanded their medicare clinical activities and service offerings in numerous ways. cchn has been a long-term supporter of the fqhc specific market basket serving as the annual update method for health centers, in both medicare and medicaid and appreciates that cms updates the calculation periodically so that the cost weights will reflect a current mix of goods and services purchased in providing fqhc services. while we strongly support updating the marketbasket, we have some concerns about the structure of the recalculation. nachcs comments go into more detail on these concerns and we encourage cms to closely review those comments and work directly with nachc to ensure the recalculation appropriately captures the costs and updates the marketbasket. exclusion from aco assignment of certain services reported by fqhcs or rhcs when furnished in skilled nursing facilities (85 fr 50246) cchn supports the policy change that cms describes, which would ensure that when fqhc clinicians participating in accountable care organizations (acos) furnish primary care services to individuals in snfs (cpt codes 99304-99318), those services would be excluded for purposes of beneficiary assignment to an aco. as we understand, this ensures parity between fqhc practitioners and physicians and practitioners who practice in other settings with respect to this issue. we therefore support cms", "22310_1": " proposed implementing amendment at 42 c.f.r.
